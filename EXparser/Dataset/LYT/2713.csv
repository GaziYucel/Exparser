An enlarged EU might be structurally integrated, but the ways in which pre-1989 EU	56.70000076293945	430.9098205566406	12.0	481.8960075378418	6	ArialMT
members used to imagine their counterparts during the Cold War period have profoundly	56.70001220703125	444.7098083496094	12.0	481.8023681640625	6	ArialMT
influenced the ways in which ‘east’ Europe has been and still is thought nowadays (hence	56.70001220703125	458.5097961425781	12.0	481.8887939453125	6	ArialMT
the remaining ideational divergences within a political Europe). The paper argues that	56.70001220703125	472.3097839355469	12.0	481.921142578125	6	ArialMT
European construction and pos-1989 enlargement of the EU towards East imply a form of	56.700042724609375	486.1097717285156	12.0	481.8995666503906	6	ArialMT
subtle and untold domination of the Western part of the continent subtlety and at times	56.700042724609375	499.9097595214844	12.0	481.8361511230469	6	ArialMT

Europe. Such domination, as an unintended consequence, is best explored on the	56.700042724609375	527.509765625	12.0	481.9199523925781	6	ArialMT

Discussing slope-metaphors and allochronisms in the field of a European common	56.700042724609375	555.1097412109375	12.0	481.8828430175781	6	ArialMT

Western Europe. By combining allochronism and heteronomy, we have coined the new	56.700042724609375	582.709716796875	12.0	481.8912048339844	6	ArialMT
term of ‘heterochrony’ to express the situation in which a given group does not have the	56.700042724609375	596.5097045898438	12.0	481.8167419433594	6	ArialMT

situation is due to reasons of different time location (in that case in a backward situation)	56.700042724609375	624.1097412109375	12.0	481.8863830566406	6	ArialMT

1. Introduction: Othering process, cognitive means and time.	56.70000076293945	85.3587646484375	12.0	346.77717208862305	10	Arial-BoldItalicMT
We will discuss in this paper the view that the enlarged European Union we now live in and	92.0999984741211	122.26336669921875	12.0	446.5920181274414	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
which we intellectually perceive is as much the direct result of 1989 than it is of the efforts to create	56.70001220703125	136.0633544921875	12.0	481.99920654296875	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the first European Communities in the 1950s. The breaking apart of the Communist block ushered	56.700042724609375	149.86334228515625	12.0	481.9391784667969	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
in a new era for a political Europe where positive features (EU enlargement commenced in 1995 by	56.700042724609375	163.663330078125	12.0	481.9200134277344	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
incorporating the hitherto ‘neutral’ states of Austria, Finland and Sweden, not to mention the 2004	56.7000732421875	177.46331787109375	12.0	481.9176025390625	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
and 2007 enlargements) coexist with more problematic ones (unsolved security agreements between	56.7000732421875	191.2633056640625	12.0	481.99798583984375	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the EU and Russia, some occidentalist reductionist ways of describing Eastern Europe in urgent	56.7000732421875	205.0032958984375	12.0	481.926025390625	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
need to catch up with (Western) Europe, or the stumbling bocks still existing between East and	56.7000732421875	218.80328369140625	12.0	481.9608154296875	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
West on the debate of a common European memory). One could say that 1989 ‘made’ Europe, but	56.7000732421875	232.603271484375	12.0	481.94403076171875	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
in an imperfect manner. So, what has been the impact of European integration on 1989? Prior	56.7000732421875	246.40325927734375	12.0	481.9571533203125	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
western European integration facilitated and legitimated, it may be surmised, the notion of a ‘return	56.7000732421875	260.2032470703125	12.0	481.9896240234375	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
to Europe’ voiced by the dissidents and revolutionaries in the Soviet bloc as well as the	56.700042724609375	274.00323486328125	12.0	482.0447692871094	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Gorbachevian notion of a Common European Home. Yet, how was the transformation of Europe	56.700042724609375	287.80322265625	12.0	481.9367980957031	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
after 1989 constrained and enabled by the pre-existence of a common western political project?	56.700042724609375	301.60321044921875	12.0	458.1636047363281	11	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
1989 ‘made’ Europe because what was hitherto a divided continent now became united.	92.0999984741211	329.203369140625	11.999969482421875	446.56803131103516	12	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
More specifically, the revolutions of 1989 brought in their wake German unity. Negotiations	56.69999694824219	343.0033264160156	12.0	481.94398498535156	12	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
regarding German unification and the integration of this new Germany into western structures were	56.699981689453125	356.8033142089844	12.0	481.9787902832031	12	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
to change fundamentally the reality and the idea of Europe. One could say that Germany epitomizes	56.699981689453125	370.6033020019531	12.0	481.9427795410156	12	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the problem of an enlarged Europe Union to 27 members: by incorporating the eastern part into the	56.699981689453125	384.36956787109375	12.033721923828125	481.9416198730469	12	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
western part of the FRG, the historical experience and identity of the GDR tended to be written off	56.70001220703125	398.1695556640625	12.033721923828125	481.93072509765625	12	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
and to disappear (and quite symptomatically, they are dubbed the ‘new’ Länder so as to insist that	56.70001220703125	411.96954345703125	12.033721923828125	481.95587158203125	12	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
things had be started anew there) based on the assumption that they had little, or simply nothing to	56.70001220703125	425.8032531738281	12.0	481.9151611328125	12	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

We will argue that a same phenomenon has happened between EU15 (western Europe) and	92.0999984741211	467.2033386230469	12.0	446.57279205322266	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the new 12 EU member states: 15+12 may have created an enlarged EU that is now indeed	56.699981689453125	481.0033264160156	12.0	481.9559631347656	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
structurally integrated (or in the continuous process of complete integration), but the ways in which	56.70001220703125	494.8033142089844	12.0	481.9307861328125	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
EU15/West Germany used to imagine their/its counterpart(s) during the Cold War period have	56.70001220703125	508.603271484375	12.0	481.9332275390625	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
profoundly influenced the ways in which ‘east’ Europe has been and still is thought nowadays	56.70001220703125	522.4033203125	12.0	481.87451171875	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
(hence the ideational divergences that this conference tries to tackle). Put differently, the process of	56.70001220703125	536.2032470703125	12.0	481.936767578125	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
ideational convergence that EU enlargement should have carried through and fulfilled in the period	56.70001220703125	550.0032958984375	12.0	481.9332275390625	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
1989-2004 was profoundly and negatively affected by an occidentalist bias in which the	56.70001220703125	563.80322265625	12.0	481.96673583984375	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
GDR/Eastern Europe was thought not on the basis of its own merit, features or characteristics but as	56.70001220703125	577.603271484375	11.999984741210938	482.04608154296875	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the negative Other of an integrating Western Europe. ‘Othering’ mechanisms most frequently	56.700042724609375	591.4032592773438	12.0	481.9103698730469	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
contribute to simplifications and negative stereotypes, and this paper will discuss some of these	56.700042724609375	605.2032470703125	12.0	481.9056091308594	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
mechanisms and their consequences in the power relation between eastern and western Europe. Of	56.700042724609375	619.0032958984375	12.0	482.0280456542969	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
interest for us here will be the case of collective memory around European themes, political	56.700042724609375	632.8032836914062	12.0	481.8492126464844	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
contributions to a European acquis and questions of collective autonomy, and how 1989 has been a	56.700042724609375	646.603271484375	12.0	481.9512023925781	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
turning point in such problematic mutual perceptions between Eastern and Western Europe. The	56.700042724609375	660.4032592773438	12.0	481.8636169433594	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
paper will not discuss the institutional arrangements of post-1989 EU life but dwells at length on	56.700042724609375	674.2032470703125	12.0	481.9332580566406	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
ideational and cognitive issues for two reasons. One because ‘Europe’ (as a political project) needs	56.7000732421875	688.0032958984375	12.0	482.0340576171875	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
to rethink itself if it wants to be more inclusive and more democracy-friendly (the self-reflective	56.7000732421875	701.8032836914062	12.0	482.07366943359375	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
dimension of Europe). Second, because for individuals and state to feel as fully equals within the	56.7000732421875	715.603271484375	12.0	481.93798828125	13	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

access to cognitive means1 (the capacity of auto-institution on the cognitive level).	56.70001220703125	84.12408447265625	14.43927001953125	396.9912109375	15	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Of central concern in this paper is the study of certain discourses articulated around deep	92.0999984741211	114.163330078125	12.0	446.50077056884766	16	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
differences between East/West and favoring dichotomous understanding of Europe. We will try to	56.699981689453125	127.96331787109375	12.0	481.8708190917969	16	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
understand why such discourses occur, what are their meanings and discuss some of their examples,	56.699981689453125	141.7633056640625	12.0	481.9643249511719	16	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
a famous illustration being that of Norman Davies when he dissects the division ‘East and West	56.699981689453125	155.56329345703125	12.0	481.8780822753906	16	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Europe’. In that perspective (and in his critique the occidentalistic-cum-orientalistic framework)	56.699981689453125	169.36328125	12.0	481.9799499511719	16	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Norman Davies shows how the famous curriculum course on ‘Western Civilisation’ introduces	56.699981689453125	183.16326904296875	12.0	481.9631652832031	16	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

1. That the western and eastern halves of Europe are separate entities with little or nothing in	56.70000076293945	210.703369140625	12.0	481.94880294799805	16	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

2. That Eastern Europe is not really part of Europe, or not part of ‘the real Europe’.	56.70000076293945	238.3033447265625	12.0	404.8907890319824	16	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
3. That the East-West division of Europe, which can be observed in different manifestations at	56.70000076293945	252.10333251953125	12.0	481.96552658081055	16	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

Attila Melegh, in a recent stimulant book, questions also such dualisms and argues that an	95.09639739990234	431.50335693359375	12.0	443.6364517211914	17	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

but also the capacity to choose its cognitive means to do so (Castoriadis 1986, 1997 and 1999). We will develop later	56.70355224609375	715.0237426757812	10.019996643066406	468.97222900390625	19	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

1989 has taken in this process. That there was a relation of power between the EU and (soon to be)	56.699920654296875	114.163330078125	12.0	481.8971862792969	21	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
candidate Eastern European states in the period 1989-2004 is out of doubt (one just needs to think	56.699920654296875	127.96331787109375	12.0	481.9319763183594	21	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

devices reinforcing divides between social groups (in our case, the ‘east’ and the ‘west’). In this	56.699951171875	183.16326904296875	12.0	481.9176025390625	21	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

to do some work on its collective history with regard to the extermination of Jews.5 We argue that	56.69989013671875	318.66412353515625	14.439239501953125	481.95611572265625	22	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
there is a slope here as well, because differences in the Vergangenheitsbewältigungen tend to be	56.70001220703125	334.86962890625	12.033721923828125	481.83843994140625	22	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT

understanding of such people leading to discriminatory or racist views, and second that it	56.70000076293945	86.5633544921875	12.0	481.92963790893555	26	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
disempowers them putting them in a situation of heteronomy7. By combining allochronism and	56.70001220703125	97.924072265625	14.43927001953125	481.9295654296875	26	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
heteronomy, we have coined the new term of ‘heterochrony’ to express the situation in which a	56.70001220703125	114.163330078125	12.0	481.9608154296875	26	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
given group does not have the capacity of choosing its own laws and the cognitive means to think	56.70001220703125	127.9295654296875	12.03375244140625	481.96917724609375	26	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
of itself and where such situation is due to reasons of different time location (in that case in a	56.70001220703125	141.7633056640625	12.0	481.97998046875	26	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
backward situation) than other autonomous groups. Let us see now how such theme can be found in	56.70001220703125	155.56329345703125	12.0	481.92474365234375	26	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the post-1989 phase, how this has become an institutional problem and how it relates to the question	56.70001220703125	169.36328125	12.0	481.82891845703125	26	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

If there was an impact of 1989 on European ‘integration’8, there is probably also some	92.0999984741211	250.86407470703125	14.43927001953125	446.44559478759766	28	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
reflections to gain from the following reversed question: What has been the impact of European	56.699981689453125	267.10321044921875	12.0	481.9967956542969	28	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
integration on 1989? In other words, has the transformation of a post-1989 eastern Europe been	56.699981689453125	280.86944580078125	12.03375244140625	481.9223937988281	28	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
constrained by the pre-existence of a common western political project, west of the Iron Curtain? If	56.699981689453125	294.66943359375	12.03375244140625	481.9440002441406	28	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
so, how? To give short answers to this question, we will resort to three sub-questions.	56.699981689453125	308.503173828125	12.0	410.98443603515625	28	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
The first question: Has there been an impact of 1989 on European Integration? If so, of	92.0999984741211	336.06951904296875	12.033721923828125	446.5152359008789	29	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
what kind? This is well beyond the scope of this paper, and 1989 surely had a variety of impacts on	56.70001220703125	349.8695068359375	12.033721923828125	481.91278076171875	29	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
European integration and European societies at large. A short answer, easier to give now that the	56.70001220703125	363.7032165527344	12.0	481.97283935546875	29	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
2004 and 2007 enlargements took place is that the collapse of Iron Curtain has allowed the entry of	56.70001220703125	377.5032043457031	12.0	481.8887939453125	29	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
former communist as well as some neutral countries into the EEC/EU. 1989 has, in a way, given a	56.70001220703125	391.3031921386719	12.0	481.82525634765625	29	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
new impetus towards a revamped and enlarged common ‘European House’ (to take the phrase of	56.70001220703125	405.1031799316406	12.0	481.99200439453125	29	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Gorbatchov). But why was it that ‘Europe’ became the roof for integration of a post-1989 eastern	56.70001220703125	418.9031677246094	12.0	481.93804931640625	29	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Europe? This leads us to the second question.	56.70001220703125	432.7031555175781	12.0	218.63882446289062	29	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
What has been the impact of European integration on 1989? The response, though	92.0999984741211	460.26953125	12.033721923828125	446.5475845336914	30	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
seemingly tautological, is simply another wave of ‘European integration’, yet of another kind. Since	56.69999694824219	474.1032409667969	12.0	481.98841857910156	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the EEC was one of the most effective supra-national political institutions at the time of the collapse	56.70001220703125	487.9032287597656	12.0	482.0892333984375	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
of the Soviet empire, the model of European integration provided a direct blueprint or a clear	56.70001220703125	501.7032470703125	12.0	481.96795654296875	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
horizon for eastern Europe (hence the (problematic) notion shared by many that there was a ‘return	56.70001220703125	515.503173828125	12.0	481.92120361328125	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
to Europe’). The process is what is referred to in neo-institutionalist parlance as a case of path-	56.70001220703125	529.30322265625	12.0	481.87799072265625	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
dependency. Once the project of an effective European community was re-launched in the 1980s	56.70001220703125	543.1031494140625	12.0	481.888671875	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
and that political momentum was given towards further integration by the 1987 Single Act, the	56.70001220703125	556.9031982421875	12.0	481.96319580078125	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
existing and already expanding European institution was the natural candidate at the time of the	56.70001220703125	570.66943359375	12.03369140625	482.04718017578125	30	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
Soviet collapse to preside over renewed collaboration between East and West. Other ‘pan-	56.70001220703125	584.503173828125	11.999984741210938	481.9007568359375	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
European’ institutions existed and mattered already back then, like NATO, Conference for Security	56.69999694824219	598.3031616210938	12.0	482.03993225097656	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Council of Europe, but since the post-1989 task	56.699981689453125	612.1031494140625	12.0	481.9607849121094	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
included also the question of German re-unification (a still very sour point to many European states	56.699981689453125	625.9031982421875	12.0	481.9488220214844	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
back in 1989, and an issue that had driven a decisive wedge in the East-West relationship in the	56.699981689453125	639.7031860351562	12.0	482.0196228027344	30	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
7 To define heteronomy, we will tap again into the work of Castoriadis. Autonomy, as pointed earlier, is the capacity to	56.70000076293945	667.213623046875	11.807113647460938	476.5146598815918	31	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
choose its own laws and the cognitive means to do so. An autonomous society is one that has the capacity of auto-	56.703521728515625	680.5237426757812	10.020004272460938	457.3791198730469	31	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
institution, that is the capacity for societies to openly ‘call into question their own institution, their representation of the	56.703521728515625	691.95849609375	10.048080444335938	477.1826477050781	31	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
world, their social imaginary significations’ (Castoriadis 1997: 17).	56.703521728515625	703.5095825195312	10.020004272460938	269.7835388183594	31	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
In an heteronymous society, there is no capacity to choose its laws and/or there is closure on the cognitive level. By	56.699501037597656	715.0206298828125	10.019996643066406	463.0112533569336	31	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
closure Castoriadis means that a given society does not have the possibilities to choose the ways and means in which	56.699493408203125	726.4835205078125	10.019996643066406	467.4339294433594	31	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
they reflect about themselves. Closure implies the law of others imposed on this society.	56.699493408203125	738.0065307617188	10.019996643066406	353.4806823730469	31	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
8 The term ‘integration’ would be discussing since it is highly contentious. For a discussion of the term ‘integration’ see	56.70000076293945	747.7337036132812	11.807044982910156	479.55390548706055	31	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the work on US-influence on the first steps of European construction in Winand (1993) and Aldrich (1997).	56.70353698730469	760.983642578125	10.019996643066406	430.7098846435547	31	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

nascent cold war in the late 1940s), the issue of East-West unification had to be subordinated to a	56.70000076293945	72.7296142578125	12.03375244140625	481.98957443237305	33	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
political forum with binding supra-national powers and in which the USA could have a say.9 NATO	56.699981689453125	84.12408447265625	14.43927001953125	481.9248352050781	33	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
could not be such a forum (because of its military nature and the reluctance of the Soviet Union/CIS	56.70001220703125	100.36334228515625	12.0	482.02435302734375	33	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
to abandon all of its sphere of influence—although NATO was also part of the discussion back in	56.699951171875	114.163330078125	12.0	481.9031982421875	33	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
1989, as much as it is still part of the problem in Europe now if one just looks at the stand off	56.699951171875	127.96331787109375	12.0	481.963134765625	33	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
between Russia and Europe on the question of Georgia this Summer), while the Council of Europe	56.699951171875	141.7633056640625	12.0	481.88397216796875	33	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
and the CSCE (transformed in 1994 into the OSCE) were only too loose inter-governmental	56.699951171875	155.56329345703125	12.0	481.96319580078125	33	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
institutions to be able to decide on such important matters. Moreover, as observes Delcour (2008),	56.699920654296875	169.36328125	12.0	481.9200134277344	33	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
by the time of the Wall collapse, the EEC was already engaged in managing a flow of aid to Poland	56.699920654296875	183.16326904296875	12.0	481.8935852050781	33	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
and Hungary and therefore the EEC was the natural candidate to cope with the task of helping	56.699920654296875	196.90325927734375	12.0	481.9596252441406	33	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Eastern Europe out of planed economy and of bureaucratic dictatorships.	56.699920654296875	210.7032470703125	12.0	349.7784118652344	33	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Why would path-dependency be important in this phase of transition? Because institutions	92.0999984741211	238.3033447265625	12.0	446.6064224243164	34	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
(such as that of the EEC and EU) have their development constrained by past learning processes	56.70001220703125	252.10333251953125	12.0	481.884033203125	34	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
and organizational memories rather than by totally new external impetuses.10 In our case, the	56.70001220703125	263.464111328125	14.439208984375	481.8912353515625	34	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
institutional lasting imprint we will look is that of the cold war vision of Eastern Europe (See	56.699981689453125	279.70330810546875	12.0	481.9992370605469	34	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

therefore to be rebuild and reconstruct from scratch.11 The EEC (soon to become EU) which was	56.699981689453125	304.86407470703125	14.43927001953125	481.8780822753906	34	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
well active by 1989 as an inter-governmental forum, and which in part had just started working with	56.70001220703125	321.10333251953125	12.0	481.84088134765625	34	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
some Central European countries, was therefore the natural candidate to oversee the re-birth of	56.70001220703125	334.9033203125	12.0	481.94281005859375	34	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
‘Europe’, east and west alike, launching a new phase of European integration. This leads us to the	56.70001220703125	348.70330810546875	12.0	481.94403076171875	34	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
third level of questioning, which has to do with the nature of ‘Europe’, as a political project, and the	56.70001220703125	362.5032958984375	12.0	481.93804931640625	34	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
consequences of this dominant position acquired in 1989 by ‘Europe’ which was born out of the	56.70001220703125	376.30328369140625	12.0	481.96197509765625	34	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

Europe? ‘Europe’, as a political project born of the creation of the first communities in the 1950s	56.70001220703125	431.4696044921875	12.033721923828125	481.92242431640625	35	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
(European Coal and Steel Community, European Economic Community, EURATOM) was not a	56.700042724609375	445.3033142089844	12.0	482.0039978027344	35	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
‘neutral’ or ‘technocratic’ project, but was clearly a political project favoured and largely funded by	56.700042724609375	459.1033020019531	12.0	481.9367980957031	35	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the USA in the immediate post-WW2 period (Aldrich 1997). If one wants therefore to understand	56.700042724609375	472.9032897949219	12.0	481.9607849121094	35	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
what has been the impact of a pre-existent political Europe (EEC) on the post-1989 Europe, one has	56.700042724609375	486.7032775878906	12.0	481.9668273925781	35	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
to understand not only the EEC in the 1980s but also the origins of this political Europe, for it	56.700042724609375	500.5032958984375	12.0	481.9008483886719	35	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

Europe four or five decades later. It is thus important to understand the biases that ‘Europe’ has	56.7000732421875	528.0695190429688	12.03375244140625	481.884033203125	35	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
both for eastern Europe and for Europe as a geographical entity. It is puzzling to note, first of all,	56.7000732421875	541.9031982421875	12.0	482.038818359375	35	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

by the EU, yet, when one opens a history book on Europe, very little will be said about this political	56.700042724609375	569.503173828125	12.0	481.9488220214844	35	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Europe, or that it is not so well ‘integrated’ with the history of European states (just to take two	56.700042724609375	583.30322265625	11.999984741210938	481.9980163574219	35	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
9 On how the USA’s influence over Europe gradually vanished from the 1980s onwards, see Lundestad (2003).	56.70000076293945	632.713623046875	11.807113647460938	444.96979904174805	36	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
10 On path-dependency and neo-institutionalism in general, see DiMaggio & Powell (1991: in particular pp. 192ff).	56.70000076293945	644.233642578125	11.807113647460938	460.2326774597168	36	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
11 One could argue that path-dependency is also important here because the nature of European construction has been to	56.70000076293945	655.6937255859375	11.806991577148438	479.72163009643555	36	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
turn its back to a past of national antagonism and enmity (e.g. France vs Germany) and to construct a positive	56.69708251953125	669.0037231445312	10.020004272460938	438.6404724121094	36	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
collaborative project instead. The period 1989-1991 is another moment where Europe is reluctant to look at a certain	56.69708251953125	680.5267333984375	10.020004272460938	466.7247314453125	36	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
past of rather unorthodox cooperation in the field of military cooperation in the shadow of the NATO and of unpleasant	56.69708251953125	691.9896240234375	10.020004272460938	478.5162353515625	36	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
alliances and flirts with extreme right-wing groups in Western Europe. The so-called GLADIO network of stay-behind	56.687042236328125	703.5125732421875	10.020004272460938	475.4970397949219	36	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
armies in case of Soviet invasion was behind the strategy of tension by western European governments in the 1960s and	56.687042236328125	715.0355834960938	10.019996643066406	480.2154235839844	36	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
1970s. Ganser (2005) discusses at length these networks. It is interesting to see that these were partly made public	56.687042236328125	726.4984741210938	10.019996643066406	455.9111633300781	36	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
around 1990 and 1991, but passed the Fall 1991, all European governments then refused to participate and comment on	56.687042236328125	738.021484375	10.019996643066406	477.6996765136719	36	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
their existence. Can this be another impact of 1989, namely a sort of Flucht nach vorn to avoid to deal with western	56.687042236328125	749.5162963867188	10.048194885253906	463.0623474121094	36	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT

examples, we can quote the work of Tony Judt (2005)12 or Harold James (2003), where the question	56.70000076293945	70.3240966796875	14.43927001953125	481.87202072143555	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
of European integration occupies only a tiny portion of their influential works on Europe taken as a	56.70001220703125	86.5633544921875	12.0	481.99200439453125	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
geographical aggregation of nation-states). So there is a discrepancy between the avowed goal of a	56.70001220703125	100.36334228515625	12.0	481.9908447265625	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
political Europe to represent an integrated physical Europe in general and the place granted to this	56.70001220703125	114.163330078125	12.0	481.90570068359375	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
political project in historical works (and probably in the mind of most Europeans). This discrepancy	56.70001220703125	127.96331787109375	12.0	481.8887939453125	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
is nonetheless interesting for us because it indicates that the political project of ‘Europe’ has been	56.70001220703125	141.7633056640625	12.0	481.87445068359375	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
trying to project the idea of a common European fate as a basis for a full integration.13 It is this	56.70001220703125	153.12408447265625	14.43927001953125	481.95123291015625	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
project, that one could qualify as hegemonic since it tends to erase other narratives and tends	56.70001220703125	169.36334228515625	12.0	481.9200439453125	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
towards its own satisfaction via diverse institutional means. ‘Europe’ disposes of many ways and	56.70001220703125	183.163330078125	12.0	481.94036865234375	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
institutions through which it can diffuse its visions of ‘Europe’. These institutions take various	56.70001220703125	196.9033203125	12.0	481.9307861328125	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
forms, mostly cognitive ones by playing on European symbols, historical memory, etc. although the	56.70001220703125	210.70330810546875	12.0	481.86236572265625	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
financial aspect is no less important, with massive projects on European identity, history, funded by	56.70001220703125	224.5032958984375	12.0	481.9439697265625	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the Commission over the last ten or fifteen years. Interestingly, the two declarations by the EEC/EU	56.70001220703125	238.30328369140625	12.0	482.0015869140625	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

1973 (Copenhagen Declaration) and in 1983 (Stuttgart Declaration), well before the end of the Cold	56.70001220703125	265.90325927734375	12.0	481.96197509765625	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
War and in a period where ‘Europe’ meant western Europe.14	56.70001220703125	277.26397705078125	14.43927001953125	294.99029541015625	38	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
The surge of such literature on a ‘cultural’ Europe is one manifestation of a rather recent	92.0999984741211	307.3033447265625	12.0	446.44193267822266	39	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
way of conceiving of ‘Europe’ as a place allegedly sharing a same cultural stratum.15 If we take the	56.69999694824219	318.66412353515625	14.439239501953125	481.90797424316406	39	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
representation of European construction in a selection of European textbooks, we can see that there	56.699981689453125	334.9033508300781	12.0	481.9512023925781	39	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
is a Europeanisation of the historical representation of ‘Europe’. By Europeanisation, we mean that	56.70001220703125	348.7033386230469	12.0	481.9307861328125	39	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
we are not only witnessing the drafting of a common supra-national curriculum around Europe and	56.70001220703125	362.5033264160156	12.0	482.023193359375	39	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the publication of common European textbooks in France and Germany,16 but also that there is a	56.70001220703125	373.8641357421875	14.439208984375	482.05914306640625	39	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

construction gradually vanish and leave place to a common narrative around a cultural Europe	56.70001220703125	403.9033203125	12.0	481.80596923828125	39	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
(Challand 2009). 1989 is presented as an important unfolding moment for ‘Europe’ since it offered	56.70001220703125	417.70330810546875	12.0	481.9151611328125	39	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the possibility for eastern Europe to converge and follow the path of western Europe.	56.70001220703125	431.5032958984375	12.0	408.56402587890625	39	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

15 I am grateful to Chris Amrbruster for observing that this literature on a cultural Europe is also an effect of 1989 and	56.70000076293945	699.4337158203125	11.806991577148438	474.5715446472168	41	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

literature and so on because other political and economic claims to Europeanness across the whole continent were	56.697052001953125	724.2066040039062	10.019996643066406	455.4500427246094	41	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

the theme of the self-reflective dimension of Europe outlined in the introduction) is problematic in	56.70001220703125	126.163330078125	12.0	482.0760498046875	50	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
three senses.	56.70001220703125	139.96331787109375	12.0	60.73320007324219	50	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
3.a) Negative Western stereotypes of CEE as a land of emptiness?	56.70000076293945	165.8433837890625	12.0	335.0304069519043	51	TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT
First, in this vision of an always expanding (western) political Europe, it is as though eastern	92.09519958496094	182.5633544921875	12.0	446.48280334472656	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Europe does not have anything to offer to European integration. In the three questions I have raised	56.699981689453125	196.36334228515625	12.0	481.9691467285156	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
above, it is as though eastern Europe was the land of emptiness, with no wealth, knowledge,	56.69996643066406	210.163330078125	12.0	481.92002868652344	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
institutions, or history upon which a post-1989 Europe could draw resources, only the passive	56.699951171875	223.9033203125	12.0	481.9307861328125	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
receptacles of information, good practices and projects to be funded by Brussels (Illustration 1	56.699951171875	237.70330810546875	12.0	481.95355224609375	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
perfectly matches this distorted reading). But is it the case that eastern Europe was so void of any	56.699951171875	251.5032958984375	12.0	482.025634765625	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
internal resources for the project of European integration? Surely, the imposition of Sovietization	56.699951171875	265.30328369140625	12.0	481.95361328125	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
and Stalinism had dire consequences in terms of cult of personality, control of the Communist Party	56.699951171875	279.103271484375	12.0	481.90679931640625	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
and loss of economic, political or cultural autonomy. Yet, there were diverse attempts within	56.699951171875	292.90325927734375	12.0	481.95599365234375	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
eastern Europe to remodel socialism with a human face or to propose autonomy with different	56.699951171875	306.7032470703125	12.0	481.96441650390625	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
forms (certain writings of Castoriadis (1976) such as the The Hungarian Source are reminders of	56.699951171875	320.469482421875	12.03375244140625	481.91510009765625	52	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
internal dynamics that have been overlooked and possibly forgotten in contemporary	56.699920654296875	334.30322265625	12.0	481.9151306152344	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

de-alignment throughout the cold war, not to mention Charter 77 and many other non-orthodox	56.699951171875	361.9031982421875	12.0	481.95599365234375	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
communist underground movements in eastern Europe inspired by the Helsinki conference. Yet, by	56.699951171875	375.70318603515625	12.0	481.88995361328125	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
portraying eastern Europe as a single entity, one tends to loose these elements and consider only the	56.699951171875	389.503173828125	12.0	481.98480224609375	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
common exposure to Soviet totalitarianism, which will not do justice to different national	56.699951171875	403.30316162109375	12.0	481.95001220703125	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
experiences and legacies. Paul Blokker’s latest work (see his paper for this Conference) is precisely	56.699951171875	417.1031494140625	12.0	481.9859619140625	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
about retrieving the positive impact of central and eastern European political thought on political	56.699951171875	430.90313720703125	12.0	481.9620361328125	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
theory in general deserves particular attention against a reducing view on eastern Europe, while	56.69996643066406	444.703125	12.0	481.9308319091797	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Christian Domnitz has presented elsewhere a typology of rich discourses about Europe that	56.70001220703125	458.50311279296875	12.0	481.95599365234375	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
emerged in the Ostblock in the period 1970-1990 (Domnitz 2008). This latter work demonstrates	56.70001220703125	472.2693786621094	12.033721923828125	482.02197265625	52	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
how certain themes of a cultural Europe premised on Christianity or other historical traits have also	56.70001220703125	486.10308837890625	12.0	481.95001220703125	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
emerged in the shadow of communism and highlight some common ground between East and West	56.70001220703125	499.903076171875	12.0	481.92724609375	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
of Europe, far from views depicting Eastern Europe as void of possible contribution to Europe at	56.69999694824219	513.7030639648438	12.0	481.9679718017578	52	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

3. b) ‘European’ identity and history	56.70000076293945	567.1832885742188	12.0	188.01598739624023	53	TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT
The second problem with a certain idea of ‘Europe’ is related to the question of collective	92.10000610351562	583.9032592773438	11.999984741210938	446.5619812011719	54	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
identity (and we will touch here on the necessity of auto-institution on the cognitive level	56.70001220703125	597.7032470703125	12.0	481.9727783203125	54	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
introduced in the introduction). As known from social sciences, the question of identity is a very	56.70001220703125	611.5032348632812	12.0	481.94403076171875	54	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
slippery one for it automatically refers to a political project and/or point of view (Wagner 2005).	56.70001220703125	625.30322265625	12.0	481.96563720703125	54	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
With regard to collective identity18 one should always consider the relation of a polity to its present,	56.70001220703125	636.6641235351562	14.439208984375	482.345947265625	54	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
future but also to its past. An integrated Europe in the present form is an agglomerate of 27 member	56.69999694824219	652.9033203125	12.0	481.94996643066406	54	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
states whose future is to aim at integrating into a single market and, possibly, expand to include new	56.699981689453125	666.703369140625	12.0	481.9103698730469	54	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
member states in the future. Even if the stress is put on the acquis communautaire (expressed	56.699981689453125	680.4696044921875	12.03375244140625	481.8864440917969	54	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
generally in legal terms) as a binding common element to the 27 member states, there remains the	56.70001220703125	694.3033447265625	12.0	481.9931640625	54	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
dividing element of different historical pasts. We could say here that western and eastern Europes	56.70001220703125	708.1033935546875	12.0	481.792724609375	54	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
(if we take these two realms as cohesive entities for the sake of the intellectual exercise) are in a	56.70001220703125	721.9033813476562	12.0	482.06768798828125	54	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
18 Another quaestio vexata is the difference between individual and collective identity. On this topic, see Winter &	56.70000076293945	747.7337036132812	11.807044982910156	459.01813888549805	55	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT

Judt perfectly demonstrates how the end of WW2, Soviet rule and the liberation from	92.0999984741211	127.96337890625	12.0	446.5043716430664	58	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
USSR’s yoke have provoked serious distortions of the past and have made of the past ‘another	56.699981689453125	141.76336669921875	12.0	481.8983459472656	58	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
country’ (Judt 2002). Thus, the imposition of a Soviet totalitarian domination and the destruction of	56.699981689453125	155.5633544921875	12.0	481.8348083496094	58	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
eastern European’s public spheres, the remoulding of national pasts according to class struggle	56.699981689453125	169.36334228515625	12.0	481.9416198730469	58	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
lines, the many damnationes memoriae and violent purges imposed during forty years, not to	56.699981689453125	183.12957763671875	12.03375244140625	481.8695983886719	58	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT

years (ibid.) and the surge of destructive nationalisms since the fall of the wall are all examples that	56.699981689453125	210.6695556640625	12.03375244140625	481.8719787597656	58	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
the past still weigh heavily on eastern European shoulders. Yet, this weigh is difficult to tackle for	56.699989318847656	224.5032958984375	12.0	481.9079818725586	58	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
not enough time has passed since. Western Europe, on the other hand, has had more time to	56.699981689453125	238.30328369140625	12.0	481.9836120605469	58	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
confront its past and reconcile certain divide that traumatic experiences such as WW2 or the	56.699981689453125	252.103271484375	12.0	481.9488220214844	58	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
political instabilities of the immediate post-war in France, Italy or Germany provoked (yet, this does	56.699981689453125	265.90325927734375	12.0	481.8108215332031	58	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

On the question of collective memory and Vergangenheitsbewältigung, the work of Stefan	92.0999984741211	307.26959228515625	12.03375244140625	446.5416030883789	59	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
Troebst (2005. 2006) is most useful for he points to the fragmented themes of memory across	56.70001220703125	321.10333251953125	12.0	481.884033203125	59	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Europe. If the Holocaust is a fundamental point for collective western European memory, other	56.70001220703125	334.9033203125	12.0	481.93914794921875	59	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
themes occupy the fore of collective debates in Central and Eastern European countries, changing	56.70001220703125	348.70330810546875	12.0	481.99444580078125	59	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
from the trauma of foreign occupations and dismemberment by Nazi and then Soviet troops	56.70001220703125	362.5032958984375	12.0	481.85400390625	59	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
(Poland, Baltic Countries, e.g.), the Gulag experience, or also the terrible recollection of Holodomor	56.70001220703125	376.30328369140625	12.0	481.82159423828125	59	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
(the 1932-33 famine in parts of the Soviet Union which struck large parts of Ukraine). Troebst is	56.70001220703125	390.103271484375	12.0	481.88043212890625	59	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
correct to state that the 2004 enlargement has revealed the depth of the difference in terms of	56.70001220703125	403.90325927734375	12.0	481.9271240234375	59	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
collective memory between East and West Europe.19	56.699981689453125	415.2641296386719	14.439117431640625	253.4703369140625	59	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Henri Rousso’s article on the dilemma of a European identity (2004) is central for our	92.0999984741211	445.3033447265625	12.0	446.4636001586914	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
discussion of heterochrony. Rousso indicates first that there seems to be a pattern in which	56.70001220703125	459.10333251953125	12.0	481.97161865234375	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
collective occultation and recollection of historical traumas follow one another (amnesia,	56.70001220703125	472.9033203125	12.0	482.00396728515625	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
anamnesis, etc.). Second, there are also uncompressible times through which historical memory has	56.70001220703125	486.70330810546875	12.0	481.91046142578125	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
to go through before any given large social group is able to accept a commonly shared interpretation	56.70001220703125	500.5032958984375	12.0	481.97039794921875	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
of the collective past: one cannot expect that a society will deal with its past right after the end of a	56.70001220703125	514.3032836914062	12.0	481.98004150390625	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
traumatic experience. Judt’s concluding essay ‘From the House of Dead’ of his Postwar (2005)	56.70001220703125	528.069580078125	12.03369140625	481.93194580078125	60	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
shows the timing and length of occultation of certain debates. To come back to the theme that	56.70001220703125	541.9032592773438	12.0	481.939208984375	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
‘Europe’ is in need of a common memory to reinforce its sense of identity, one should note that if	56.70001220703125	555.7032470703125	12.0	481.90911865234375	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
‘Europe’ is about using western European historical experience as a possible foundation for a	56.70001220703125	569.5032348632812	12.0	482.03533935546875	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
European identity (as a way to go beyond war between nations, and per antonomase a war between	56.70001220703125	583.26953125	12.033676147460938	481.95599365234375	60	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
France and Germany), then this historical experience might not be easily accepted by Eastern	56.699981689453125	597.103271484375	12.0	481.9488220214844	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
Europeans for two reasons. First, because not all Eastern Europeans have the same traumatic past to	56.699981689453125	610.9032592773438	12.0	482.0256042480469	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
confront (Troebst 2006) and because they are in a different phase of their work on memory	56.699951171875	624.7032470703125	12.0	481.9595947265625	60	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

(Törnquist-Plewa 2002: 237). The fact that allochronic trope can at times become heterochrony is	56.70001220703125	252.10333251953125	12.0	481.8792724609375	65	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

stresses in the Polish case that “identification with Europe is made difficult by the fact that Poles do	56.699981689453125	445.3033447265625	12.0	481.9535827636719	66	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
not feel accepted by those they want to identify with” (Törnquist-Plewa 2002: 239). This problem	56.699981689453125	459.10333251953125	12.0	481.9271545410156	66	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
can hardly be written off for large parts of Eastern Europe which has suffered from external power	56.699981689453125	472.9033203125	12.0	481.9955749511719	66	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
(Fremdherrschaft) and it is extremely important to acknowledge this problem. So, while Troebst is	56.69996643066406	486.6695861816406	12.033721923828125	481.9332733154297	66	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
right in pointing to a variety of traumas that Europeans have to confront, one should also think of	56.699974060058594	500.5032958984375	12.0	481.8875503540039	66	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
the timing of trauma elaboration and Erinnerungsarbeit. One cannot therefore expect, e.g.,	56.699951171875	514.26953125	12.03375244140625	481.9320068359375	66	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT

and has become (again) independent ‘not even’ twenty years ago. Any society should therefore	56.699951171875	555.7032470703125	12.0	481.87200927734375	66	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
have the right, on a cognitive level, to say: “Holocaust, or Holodomor, is not the central worry for	56.699981689453125	569.5032348632812	12.0	481.8202819824219	66	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

society. As put by the Estonian scholar Siobhan Kattago (2008b), there should be, between eastern	56.699981689453125	624.703369140625	12.0	481.9823913574219	66	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

21 This echoes the existence of oriental ‘Orientalists’ (a la Said) described in the contect of the Middle East by Sadiki	56.70000076293945	690.1937255859375	11.806991577148438	468.03120040893555	67	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
(2004: 180ff). Note that these oriental orientalists or in our case Eastern European allochronists are an indirect witness	56.697052001953125	703.5037231445312	10.020004272460938	473.9339904785156	67	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

22 Similarly, in Turkey, many people are becoming increasingly Euro-skeptic in part for the reasons stated here.	56.70000076293945	724.6936645507812	11.807044982910156	446.1669731140137	67	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

in forcing the possibility of a common fate (Schicksalsgemeinschaft) for the whole of Europe. If this	56.700042724609375	103.32958984375	12.03375244140625	481.9800109863281	70	TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT
is done too rigidly, and by not taking into consideration the fact that by ‘European’ experience we	56.700042724609375	117.163330078125	12.0	481.7952575683594	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

biases on the history of European integration that are the result of the context of the nascent Cold	56.700042724609375	158.56329345703125	12.0	482.0184631347656	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

and themes. Looking at the history of European integration through the prism of the Cold War, as	56.700042724609375	186.16326904296875	12.0	481.9369201660156	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
done by Messenger (2006) is a good reminder (against the euphoria of federalist historiography24)	56.70001220703125	197.464111328125	14.439208984375	481.9559326171875	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
of the serious security considerations at stake in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the time where the	56.699951171875	213.70330810546875	12.0	481.81195068359375	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
first European communities were founded. What such history does not tell us really is that the	56.699920654296875	227.5032958984375	12.0	481.8695983886719	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
context of Cold War served also an ‘imaginary war’, to take the phrase of Kaldor (1990) where the	56.699951171875	241.30328369140625	12.0	481.921142578125	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
enemy was not so much the external ‘other’ (eastern European communism, or Stalinism as it was	56.699951171875	255.103271484375	12.0	481.90447998046875	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

of this was that for a few decades the discourse of the threat of the Soviets and of Stalinism (which	56.699981689453125	296.50323486328125	12.0	481.9800109863281	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

undermining thus the possibility of representing the construction of a new Europe as a political	56.699951171875	337.9031982421875	12.0	481.96441650390625	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT

for ‘Europe’ with a view on internal affairs was that it turned effectively this external other into a	56.70001220703125	379.3033447265625	12.0	481.9847412109375	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
forgotten other of Europe, in the sense that it reinforced the view that Eastern Europe was totally	56.70001220703125	393.10333251953125	12.0	482.0736083984375	70	JOAEBM+TimesNewRomanPSMT
