Abstract: Elite physicians have been portrayed as opposed to the use of laboratory science in the	144.6999969482422	194.99249267578125	9.247314453125	392.10108947753906	5	BAAAAA+Arial-BoldMT

"normal" in case notes in the U.S., as representative of the growing influence of laboratory science	144.6999969482422	223.29248046875	9.0	393.7040557861328	5	DAAAAA+ArialMT

brooke's Hospital, Cambridge, England. Discourse at Bart's appears to support the view of elite	144.6999969482422	251.592529296875	9.0	378.7801055908203	5	DAAAAA+ArialMT
opposition to the laboratory. However, the case notes reveal that the bacteriological laboratory was	144.6999969482422	265.6925048828125	9.0	395.49513244628906	5	DAAAAA+ArialMT

at the hospitals. Samuel GEE, a physician at Bart's in the late nineteenth century, who also, at first	144.6999969482422	308.1925048828125	9.0	393.27406311035156	5	DAAAAA+ArialMT

are not straightforward. Analysing changes in language over time shows that rhetoric and practice	144.6999969482422	350.59246826171875	9.0	391.00416564941406	5	DAAAAA+ArialMT

of the rise of laboratory biomedical sciences. Current historiography has	144.6999969482422	711.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	351.23204040527344	21	DAAAAA+ArialMT

them as considering medicine an art rather than a science. This case has	144.6999969482422	740.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	358.07899475097656	21	DAAAAA+ArialMT

London1. An analysis of discourse in the case notes from Bart's between 1880	144.6999969482422	107.55914306640625	11.62054443359375	380.76405334472656	24	DAAAAA+ArialMT
and 1920 appears to confirm the idea that physicians were reluctant to fully	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	366.39402770996094	24	DAAAAA+ArialMT

medicine. This is especially highlighted when Bart's is compared to	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	325.86305236816406	24	DAAAAA+ArialMT
Addenbrooke's Hospital, at the time the unofficial teaching hospital for the	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	359.8260040283203	24	DAAAAA+ArialMT

However, the idea that elite physicians were not opposed to the laboratory has	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	382.43202209472656	24	DAAAAA+ArialMT
recently been raised regarding the practice of elite physicians who used	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	349.5950469970703	24	DAAAAA+ArialMT
commercial bacteriological laboratories, as only elite practitioners with wealthy	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	380.9999542236328	24	DAAAAA+ArialMT
patients could have afforded the prices charged by these institutions	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	332.8209991455078	24	DAAAAA+ArialMT
(WORBOYS, 2004). Looking at medical practice at Bart's confirms this view, and	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	394.4949493408203	24	DAAAAA+ArialMT
shows that the elite physicians who worked there welcomed the new science of	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	385.86305236816406	24	DAAAAA+ArialMT

One of the major findings in John Harley WARNER's (1997a) pioneering study of	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	394.9099884033203	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
patient records is the change of language from "natural" to "normal" over time. He	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	399.15809631347656	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
shows, with examples of two U.S. hospitals, that the use of the word "natural" to	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	389.6100616455078	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
describe a state of well-being had been "almost completely replaced" by "normal"	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	395.9040069580078	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
by the mid-1870s. "Natural" related to an individual's well-being, which could differ	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	399.16297912597656	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
with the seasons, or with ethnicity, location or sex, for example (WARNER,	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	364.4889678955078	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
1997a, pp.85-86). The term "natural" refers to disease as non-specific, and as	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	380.56300354003906	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
"systemic imbalances in the body's natural harmony" (WARNER, 1997a, p.86)2.	144.6999969482422	418.8591003417969	11.620574951171875	388.04701232910156	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
"Normal" is a word from experimental physiology which belongs to the second	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	379.3111114501953	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
half of the nineteenth century, when "universalized norms defined by laboratory	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	385.99501037597656	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
science" became the way to consider well-being (WARNER, 1997a, pp.86-87).	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	383.74195861816406	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT
This is reflected in the graphical and quantitative representation of temperature,	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	388.36305236816406	25	DAAAAA+ArialMT

Oxford elites (LAWRENCE, 2000). In LAWRENCE's (1985, pp.516-17) first article on this topic,	158.8000030517578	680.9924926757812	9.0	380.49302673339844	26	DAAAAA+ArialMT
though, Thomas Lauder BRUNTON is portrayed as an advocate of diagnostic technologies	158.8000030517578	690.9924926757812	9.0	363.60008239746094	26	DAAAAA+ArialMT

"individualism" for him—the specificity of the patient—whereas in my research this term is used	158.8000030517578	766.5924682617188	9.0	380.6051483154297	27	DAAAAA+ArialMT

There will be slightly more focus on Bart's in this paper, as this is the hospital	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	375.3209991455078	31	DAAAAA+ArialMT

this volume, this contribution is different in that it looks at change in discourse	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	377.8209991455078	32	DAAAAA+ArialMT
over a long time period of forty years. Also, it looks at the late nineteenth and	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	375.4950714111328	32	DAAAAA+ArialMT
early twentieth centuries whereas the other papers examine contemporary events	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	397.67897033691406	32	DAAAAA+ArialMT

their work historically. The paper also differs from almost all of the others by	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	370.3159942626953	32	DAAAAA+ArialMT
examining the use of particular words to examine changing concepts, rather than	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	394.7420196533203	32	DAAAAA+ArialMT
a wider framework of discourse. The use of these words is, however, analysed to	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	395.2100372314453	32	DAAAAA+ArialMT

company is constructed through this word, and in this paper on the history of	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	373.26295471191406	32	DAAAAA+ArialMT

Addenbrooke's' X-rays were initially carried out at the Cavendish Laboratory, by	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	387.9629669189453	58	DAAAAA+ArialMT

1896. Indeed, Mr. HAYLES was, according to some Cambridge medical	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	350.1420135498047	58	DAAAAA+ArialMT

interesting considering the view discussed earlier of Bart's and technological	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	372.00001525878906	58	DAAAAA+ArialMT

autobiography which tells in detail the procedures followed. The "Clinical Clerks"	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	390.7940216064453	67	DAAAAA+ArialMT
mentioned in the case notes were medical students in the clinical years of their	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	383.9309844970703	67	DAAAAA+ArialMT
degree. Clerking involved taking histories and physical examinations. Physicians	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	392.0160675048828	67	DAAAAA+ArialMT
were involved in this process though. BOURNE describes how John DRYSDALE	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	393.59303283691406	67	DAAAAA+ArialMT
led students to describe the condition of the patient through his "Socratic method	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	393.92103576660156	67	DAAAAA+ArialMT
of careful questioning", and then led them through "examination, inspection,	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	369.85804748535156	67	DAAAAA+ArialMT
palpation, percussion and auscultation." These notes were read out to the	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	359.7889862060547	67	DAAAAA+ArialMT

In a couple of instances in the casebooks, physicians' involvement is illustrated.	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	387.7940216064453	68	DAAAAA+ArialMT
For example, physicians signed requests for the pathologist to undertake a	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	364.96299743652344	68	DAAAAA+ArialMT
Widal's test (invented in 1896). This is in the same case book, in 1898, but	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	363.7790069580078	68	DAAAAA+ArialMT

more significant for trends. However, there are noticeable differences which can	144.6999969482422	649.8796997070312	11.0	389.97901916503906	79	DAAAAA+ArialMT

1870 the Royal College of Surgeons introduced a requirement that thirty classes	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	391.77406311035156	124	DAAAAA+ArialMT

this development led to the growth of physiology in Britain (GEISON, 1978,	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	364.9580841064453	124	DAAAAA+ArialMT

Keir WADDINGTON (2003, pp.125-6) has presented physiology at Bart's as	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	370.91603088378906	125	DAAAAA+ArialMT

faced were also present in Cambridge, such as lack of space for students	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	349.59983825683594	125	DAAAAA+ArialMT
(GEISON, 1978, pp.171-2). Although Bart's did not have the reputation of the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	367.42604064941406	125	DAAAAA+ArialMT

Bart's physician may help to illuminate why discourse was so different from	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	365.0789337158203	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT

The concept of "double lives" can be used as a device to try to understand why	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	385.45802307128906	133	DAAAAA+ArialMT

completely different life to that shown by his medical practice on the wards at	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	375.0630645751953	133	DAAAAA+ArialMT

GEE has been portrayed as an advocate of medicine as an art. Indeed,	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	348.0210418701172	135	DAAAAA+ArialMT

However, evidence from the clinical case notes from GEE's wards show that his	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	389.10499572753906	142	DAAAAA+ArialMT

lay the foundations of the Pathology Department during his four years at Bart's	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	382.9889678955078	142	DAAAAA+ArialMT
(WADDINGTON, 2003, p.117). GEE's patients were diagnosed with Widal's tests	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	396.55702209472656	142	DAAAAA+ArialMT

GEE's private notebooks show his use and opinions of bacteriology. These	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	365.3479766845703	143	DAAAAA+ArialMT

GEE's advocacy of opposing ideas was part of his personality. LEGG (1915,	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	372.02101135253906	150	DAAAAA+ArialMT

dogmatism, GEE (1915c, p.236) had a "kindly feeling" towards the "Empiric sect",	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	397.80397033691406	150	DAAAAA+ArialMT

Indeed, his aphoristic style of writing, privately, and publicly in HORDER's	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	358.49000549316406	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT

"natural" and "normal" were used fairly equally in the 1880s and 1890s. However,	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	396.48902893066406	159	DAAAAA+ArialMT

about the reasons for their illnesses (HORDER, 1937b, p.183). He defended his	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	389.9049835205078	169	DAAAAA+ArialMT

Professionally, however, the position of pathologist was not as grand as being a	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	389.0630645751953	170	DAAAAA+ArialMT
physician. Indeed, ANDREWES (1928, p.116) expected to become a physician at	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	397.51002502441406	170	DAAAAA+ArialMT

"a big change in one's life", but he realised he "loved laboratory work more than	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	387.8950958251953	170	DAAAAA+ArialMT

cians were paid under 100 guineas at Bart's, but through private practice they	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	378.4259796142578	170	DAAAAA+ArialMT
could achieve huge salaries (SBH Ha 6/5 1895; SBH Ha 1/27 1895). The Bart's	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	386.3780059814453	170	DAAAAA+ArialMT

TON, 1984, p.32). In a meeting between the Treasurer and the Medical Council	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	387.5740509033203	170	DAAAAA+ArialMT

adequate payment, but still all that class of work is not highly paid" (SBH Ha 6/5	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	388.73109436035156	170	DAAAAA+ArialMT
1895). So, this low status of the bacteriologist shows why the physicians may	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	375.87904357910156	170	DAAAAA+ArialMT

of bedside medicine and the new world of the laboratory, and holding onto the old	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	397.6210479736328	172	DAAAAA+ArialMT

Although Addenbrooke's Hospital was more similar to the U.S. in its reception of	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	390.6630401611328	173	DAAAAA+ArialMT

U.S. deserves further investigation, especially due to the prominence of	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	348.4099884033203	173	DAAAAA+ArialMT
experimental physiology in Cambridge. Differences between Bart's, and	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	349.1949920654297	173	DAAAAA+ArialMT
Addenbrooke's and the U.S., can be explained more easily. Older physicians had	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	395.6950225830078	173	DAAAAA+ArialMT
more of an influence on the creation of case notes at Bart's, the reputation of	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	375.0630645751953	173	DAAAAA+ArialMT
physiology teaching and research did not rival Cambridge, and the examination of	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	398.51002502441406	173	DAAAAA+ArialMT
GEE shows that medical practice was perhaps torn between an old and a new	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	381.3209991455078	173	DAAAAA+ArialMT

of their practice, but perhaps afraid of the threat to their profession. It may also	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	384.2740020751953	176	DAAAAA+ArialMT
simply be that at Bart's there was a cognitive distinction between a quantifiable	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	383.6740264892578	176	DAAAAA+ArialMT

almost universally described as "normal", organs and features such as colour	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	376.7000274658203	176	DAAAAA+ArialMT
were not. This distinction can be further supported as the use of bacteriological	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	385.2000274658203	176	DAAAAA+ArialMT

An examination of case notes based on language alone would represent Bart's as	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	399.1630401611328	177	DAAAAA+ArialMT
reluctant to accept the fruits of the experimental laboratory. So, at first glance,	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	380.06300354003906	177	DAAAAA+ArialMT
language does not mirror practice. However, using cluster analysis, especially of	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	391.86305236816406	177	DAAAAA+ArialMT
