The paper analyzes the radical right‘s attitudes toward the EU focusing in particular on the	113.41999816894531	143.85589599609375	9.9599609375	410.97886657714844	21	Helvetica

of opposition to the EU, within the EP they express their dissent making use of the rules of	113.41999816894531	190.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.58311462402344	21	Arial
the game, voting with the opposition more than the other forces do, but voting almost as	113.41999816894531	205.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.71067810058594	21	Arial
much with the majority. The party public office in the EP is inserted in the legislative process	113.41999816894531	221.255859375	9.9599609375	410.4654998779297	21	Arial

Many studies show that Euroscepticism has become an ideological pillar of radical right	113.41999816894531	143.85589599609375	9.9599609375	410.7875213623047	34	Arial
parties. It is a theme that has acquired greater salience within the political discourse of this	113.41999816894531	159.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.3821258544922	34	Arial
area, to the point that these parties have become the main stronghold of EU-pessimism	113.41999816894531	174.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.94126892089844	34	Arial
(Mudde 2007). Particularly, their political discourse has largely internalized the EU issue,	113.41999816894531	190.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.65171813964844	34	Arial

It is an approach that aims at integrating several dimensions of party attitudes toward the EU	113.41999816894531	385.2058410644531	9.96002197265625	410.48411560058594	36	Arial

From the theoretical point of view, the paper will contribute to understanding politics and the	113.41999816894531	524.7858276367188	9.96002197265625	410.67222595214844	37	Arial
behavior of the radical right in different ways. Firstly, the results of the comparative analysis	113.41999816894531	540.2658081054688	9.96002197265625	410.43174743652344	37	Arial
will allow us to determine whether the radical right behaves cohesively enough to present the	113.41999816894531	555.8658447265625	9.96002197265625	410.5115203857422	37	Arial
character of a real party family. Or, alternatively, it will determine whether the empirical	113.41999816894531	571.3458862304688	9.96002197265625	410.68223571777344	37	Arial

Secondly, assessing the level of congruence between the attitudes of different faces of party	113.41999816894531	649.675048828125	9.0	410.69114685058594	38	Arial

EU overlaps with that of party officials holding public office is meaningful for a comprehensive	113.41999816894531	696.2350463867188	9.0	410.62522888183594	38	Arial
understanding of the broad phenomenon of party attitudes toward the EU. Recent research shows that	113.41999816894531	711.7150268554688	9.000007629394531	411.1429901123047	38	Arial
citizens are way less pro-European than politicians (Best, Lengyel & Verzichelli forthcoming). Given the	113.41999816894531	727.195068359375	9.0	410.7781219482422	38	Arial

main components of these attitudes (dissatisfaction with the defense of national interests,	113.41999816894531	178.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.5415496826172	45	Arial

nature of the electoral system. Their visibility in these elections tends to be high and their	113.41999816894531	286.80584716796875	9.9599609375	410.83702087402344	45	Arial
programmatic assertiveness is consequently also high. It is important to note that	113.41999816894531	302.285888671875	9.9599609375	410.58128356933594	45	Arial
Euromanifestos are usually issued by the party central office and they present the overall	113.41999816894531	317.8858642578125	9.9599609375	410.52146911621094	45	Arial

The data base used for this part of the analysis was created by the IntUne project.1 A group	113.41999816894531	107.0804443359375	12.1754150390625	411.0902557373047	78	Arial

Although these documents refer to the 1979-2004 period, the large majority actually refer to	113.41999816894531	140.255859375	9.9599609375	410.63841247558594	78	Arial
1994-2004.4 One could claim that parties may have changed their attitudes over this period.	113.41999816894531	153.64044189453125	12.1754150390625	410.7656707763672	78	Arial
In fact, this does not seem to be the case for radical parties, as the empirical analysis has	113.41999816894531	171.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.47166442871094	78	Arial
already shown that a change in the attitudes toward the EU can be found mainly in the	113.41999816894531	186.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.4119110107422	78	Arial
moderate parties (Gabel & Hix 2004). On the contrary, radical parties are not inclined to	113.41999816894531	202.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.70262145996094	78	Arial
change their attitudes on the EU, they tend instead to be rather stable in their opposition	113.41999816894531	217.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.5913543701172	78	Arial
(Szcerbiack & Taggart 2003, 2008) that, over time, has only become more salient, especially	113.41999816894531	233.255859375	9.9599609375	410.5713348388672	78	Arial
in the case of the radical right (Kriesi 2007). We expect, therefore, variations across time to	113.41999816894531	248.8858642578125	9.9599609375	410.66722106933594	78	Arial
be quite limited in scope, but I will report them anyway when they are deemed relevant.	113.41999816894531	264.3658447265625	9.9599609375	384.91432189941406	78	Arial
The analysis starts with an examination of the level of occurrence of the selected themes	113.41999816894531	295.44586181640625	9.9599609375	410.68077087402344	79	Arial
within the Euromanifestos. In table 2, we find evidence of the fact that, in their documents	113.41999816894531	310.92584228515625	9.9599609375	410.68077087402344	79	Arial
radical parties generally refer to such themes as often as (or even more often than)	113.41999816894531	326.4058837890625	9.959991455078125	410.4816131591797	79	Arial
mainstream parties do. Certainly, the table does not contain any information about the	113.41999816894531	342.0058288574219	9.96002197265625	411.00437927246094	79	Arial
direction of the positions expressed on the specific issues in the documents. However, it was	113.41999816894531	357.48583984375	9.96002197265625	410.3321990966797	79	Arial
relevant to find confirmation that the analyzed themes do play an important role in the party	113.41999816894531	372.9658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.73045349121094	79	Arial

Although across parties some differences can be found in terms of frequency of occurrence,	113.41999816894531	403.92584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.45188903808594	79	Arial
overall, the selected themes recurred frequently in the Euromanifestos (in between 51.7 and	113.41999816894531	419.42584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.51170349121094	79	Arial
88.8 per cent of Euromanifestos, depending on the theme). Hence, we can be confident that	113.41999816894531	435.0258483886719	9.96002197265625	410.7632293701172	79	Arial

The analysis moves now to a more in-depth examination of the direction of party positions.	70.94400024414062	293.8858642578125	9.9599609375	410.6564025878906	92	Arial
For this purpose, I applied multinomial logistic regression models for the analysis of the	70.94400024414062	309.3658447265625	9.9599609375	410.5415344238281	92	Arial
content analytic variables drawn from the Euromanifestos. This technique allowed me to	70.94400024414062	324.84588623046875	9.959991455078125	411.0141906738281	92	Arial
estimate the likelihood for radical parties to express Eurosceptical positions as compared to	70.94400024414062	340.4458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.57122802734375	92	Arial
mainstream parties. Subsequently, within the radical party category I separated left from	70.94400024414062	355.92584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.4317626953125	92	Arial
right. The comparison of attitudes between parties of different ideological orientations allows	70.94400024414062	371.4058532714844	9.96002197265625	410.6907043457031	92	Arial

issue. Precisely, multinomial logistic regression models estimate the likelihood of different	70.94400024414062	417.8658447265625	9.96002197265625	410.82537841796875	92	Arial

category. For example, in table 3, the ExpB coefficient estimates the likelihood of each	70.94400024414062	448.9458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.581298828125	92	Arial

category ‗favourable opportunities‘. In other words, the model estimates how likely it is to find	70.94400024414062	479.9058532714844	9.96002197265625	410.4815979003906	92	Helvetica

likelihood is almost null (ExpB=0.2) for mainstream parties.5 In particular, I found that 70% of	70.94400024414062	570.6904296875	12.1754150390625	410.924560546875	92	Arial

negative evaluation of the country membership. Consequently, the expectation of a broad	70.94400024414062	603.8958740234375	9.959991455078125	410.4917297363281	92	Arial

the member states. In order to find evidence of this, I analyzed how parties think the national	113.41999816894531	416.36505126953125	9.0	410.7541961669922	109	Arial

cooperative behavior, thus for an acquiescent conduct of the national government. Furthermore, they	113.41999816894531	462.79193115234375	9.01312255859375	410.9642791748047	109	Arial

Moving the analysis to the policy dimension, we find the same pattern. In particular, we find	70.94400024414062	413.18585205078125	9.96002197265625	410.9123840332031	126	Arial
the same tendency for attitudes toward foreign and defense policy. In table 5, mainstream	70.94400024414062	428.66583251953125	9.96002197265625	410.5014343261719	126	Arial

competence and a shared EU-national competence, as compared to the reference category	70.94400024414062	459.6258544921875	9.96002197265625	410.888671875	126	Arial
of the exclusive national competence. So, mainstream parties are rather divided in terms of	70.94400024414062	475.225830078125	9.96002197265625	410.5016784667969	126	Arial
degree of involvement of the EU in foreign policy, something that could explain the difficulties	70.94400024414062	490.7058410644531	9.96002197265625	410.4018859863281	126	Arial
in integrating the ex-Second Pillar of the EU. However, they agree overwhelmingly on some	70.94400024414062	506.18585205078125	9.96002197265625	410.8360900878906	126	Arial
kind of involvement of the EU, while they voice a preference for the exclusive national	70.94400024414062	521.6658325195312	9.96002197265625	410.5911865234375	126	Arial
competence only very rarely. The same tendency can be found for defense policy (tab. 6) as	70.94400024414062	537.1458129882812	9.96002197265625	410.3721923828125	126	Arial
the preference of mainstream parties for the exclusive European competence and for the	70.94400024414062	552.6258544921875	9.96002197265625	410.5916748046875	126	Arial

are instead not significant. The reason can be found in the dispersion of their preferences	70.94400024414062	599.2158203125	9.959991455078125	410.56304931640625	126	Arial

as across countries. Overall, the preference of radical parties for the exclusive national	70.94400024414062	630.1759033203125	9.959991455078125	410.9028625488281	126	Arial
competence exceeds that for any other option. They voice this sovereignist stance in foreign	70.94400024414062	645.6558837890625	9.959991455078125	410.4716491699219	126	Arial

particular distinction between left and right. However, somewhat unexpectedly, the share for	70.94400024414062	676.73583984375	9.959991455078125	410.99810791015625	126	Arial
the other categories is also similar. Notably, over time the radical left – but not the radical	70.94400024414062	692.2158203125	9.959991455078125	410.8926696777344	126	Helvetica

the Euromanifestos of the radical left supports the EU competence (either exclusive or	113.41999816894531	109.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.8009490966797	128	Arial

In sum, differences between mainstream and radical parties are remarkable since the EU involvement	113.41999816894531	156.75506591796875	9.0	410.58909606933594	129	Arial

increasingly aligned with mainstream parties over time. In the end, the radical right is the main	113.41999816894531	203.195068359375	9.0	410.6072235107422	129	Arial

for these parties, Euroscepticism is not absolute. Although integration of these policies deeply	113.41999816894531	234.155029296875	9.0	410.74205017089844	129	Arial

We move now to the analysis of immigration policy. On the one hand, the likelihood of a	70.94400024414062	378.0058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.6109924316406	159	Arial

side of mainstream parties is almost eight (ExpB=7.75) and five (ExpB=5.13) times greater	70.94400024414062	409.0858459472656	9.96002197265625	410.5215148925781	159	Arial
than it is for exclusive national competence (reference category). However, a lack of	70.94400024414062	424.5858459472656	9.96002197265625	410.61114501953125	159	Arial
reference to immigration issues is the most likely possibility for mainstream parties	70.94400024414062	440.0658264160156	9.96002197265625	411.0120544433594	159	Arial
(ExpB=14.38). On the other hand, the preferences of radical parties are again dispersed	70.94400024414062	455.54583740234375	9.96002197265625	410.50146484375	159	Arial
among different categories. Even more than for foreign and defense policy, such dispersion	70.94400024414062	471.0258483886719	9.96002197265625	410.6509094238281	159	Arial
is to be attributed mainly to the radical left. As a matter of fact, the position of radical right	70.94400024414062	486.6258544921875	9.96002197265625	410.6435546875	159	Arial

competence in immigration policy. It is evidence of the fact that radical right parties make	70.94400024414062	517.5858764648438	9.96002197265625	410.75048828125	159	Arial
their programmatic supply on this issue very distinctive from that of the other parties and	70.94400024414062	533.0658569335938	9.96002197265625	410.66015625	159	Arial

To conclude this part of the analysis, I can summarize that I found confirmation of the fact	113.41999816894531	378.0058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.71092224121094	176	Arial
that the radical right is the main stronghold of party-based Euroscepticism. However, this	113.41999816894531	393.6058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.8452606201172	176	Arial
attitude is broad more than it is absolute, and most importantly, it is not univocal across the	113.41999816894531	409.0858459472656	9.96002197265625	410.49009704589844	176	Arial
European countries. Although still very criticized, the EU has acquired legitimacy by radical	113.41999816894531	424.5858459472656	9.96002197265625	410.3621063232422	176	Arial
right parties in some member states where its role as a policy-maker is relatively welcome.	113.41999816894531	440.0658264160156	9.96002197265625	411.09141540527344	176	Arial
The very existence of the EU is therefore not questioned by these parties. The	113.41999816894531	455.54583740234375	9.96002197265625	410.5414276123047	176	Arial
Euroscepticism of the radical right is still quite strident, especially if one compares their	113.41999816894531	471.0258483886719	9.96002197265625	410.47166442871094	176	Arial
attitudes to those of mainstream parties and even of radical left parties whose opposition	113.41999816894531	486.6258544921875	9.96002197265625	410.90525817871094	176	Arial
against the EU has become more nuanced over time. Still, it would be difficult to talk about a	113.41999816894531	502.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.4717254638672	176	Arial

fact, in the previous section it has already been shown that the programmatic supply of the	70.94400024414062	193.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.3721618652344	186	Arial
radical right is characterized by some common positions, as well as by some important	70.94400024414062	209.255859375	9.9599609375	410.5513610839844	186	Arial

behavior of radical right MEPs within the EP. In addition, this part of the analysis allows us to	70.94400024414062	240.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.52142333984375	186	Arial

positions that, as we have seen, are not so much opposed to the EU) and their institutional	70.94400024414062	286.80584716796875	9.9599609375	410.5015563964844	186	Arial

For the analysis, I have selected the EP group ‗Independence/Democracy‘ (IND/DEM) of the	70.94400024414062	333.48583984375	9.96002197265625	411.0937194824219	187	Helvetica
2004-2009 legislature. The group was created in 2004, when parties from the Eurosceptical	70.94400024414062	348.9658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.6734313964844	187	Arial
‗Europe of Democracy and Diversities‘ group made an alliance with some parties from the	70.94400024414062	364.4458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.80035400390625	187	Helvetica
new member states. The most important parties of IND/DEM were the following12: the UK	70.94400024414062	377.7104187011719	12.175445556640625	410.9407653808594	187	Arial
Independence Party (UKIP), the League of Polish Families, the Italian Northern League	70.94400024414062	395.4058532714844	9.96002197265625	410.461669921875	187	Arial
(suspended in 2006 and then expelled from the group after the scandal of the t-shirt worn by	70.94400024414062	411.0058288574219	9.96002197265625	411.04608154296875	187	Arial
the party member Calderoli showing anti-Islamic cartoons), and the Movement for France.	70.94400024414062	426.5058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.96356201171875	187	Arial
Additionally, some MEPs from Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands and	70.94400024414062	441.98583984375	9.96002197265625	410.49151611328125	187	Arial
Sweden also took part in the group. However, other important radical right parties such as	70.94400024414062	457.4658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.5513610839844	187	Arial
the French Front National and the Vlaams Belang did not join IND/DEM and decided instead	70.94400024414062	472.9458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.938232421875	187	Arial
to belong to the ‗Non Attached‘ group. By the end of the legislature, especially after the	70.94400024414062	488.42584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.6309509277344	187	Helvetica
expulsion of the Northern League, the group could rely on just 2.8 per cent of the seats in the	70.94400024414062	504.02581787109375	9.96002197265625	410.4019470214844	187	Arial
EP. Definitely, this lack of unity within the EP of radical right parties gives evidence of a lack	70.94400024414062	519.5057983398438	9.96002197265625	410.4986267089844	187	Arial
of cohesion of their intents and strategy. So the argument of whether they could be	70.94400024414062	534.98583984375	9.96002197265625	410.4915466308594	187	Arial
considered a genuine party family finds negative evidence here. At least, these parties are	70.94400024414062	550.4658813476562	9.96002197265625	410.4517822265625	187	Arial
not transnationally organized as most other party families are and this, in turn, creates an	70.94400024414062	565.9458618164062	9.96002197265625	410.6681823730469	187	Arial

The first problem that I am going to explore concerns the internal cohesion within IND/DEM.	113.41999816894531	109.2958984375	9.9599609375	411.08885192871094	190	Arial
For this purpose, in table 8 I have reported a measurement elaborated by Hix and Noury of	113.41999816894531	124.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.7703094482422	190	Arial
the internal cohesion of the EP groups in the period 2004-2009 based on the roll-call votes	113.41999816894531	140.255859375	9.9599609375	410.84983825683594	190	Arial
(all data in this section are available on-line at http://www.votewatch.eu).13 It clearly emerged	113.41999816894531	153.64044189453125	12.1754150390625	411.15928649902344	190	Arial
that within the EP context, IND/DEM was the group with lower internal cohesion,	113.41999816894531	171.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.69993591308594	190	Arial
comparatively as low as the Non-Attached group. To be more precise, their level of cohesion	113.41999816894531	186.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.67710876464844	190	Arial
was about half the average level (0.8) of all party groups with the exclusion of IND/DEM and	113.41999816894531	202.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.98301696777344	190	Arial
the Non-Attached. On the other extreme of the political spectrum, the European United	113.41999816894531	217.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.51487731933594	190	Arial
Left/Nordic Green Left group (GUE-NGL) showed a level of internal cohesion in line with the	113.41999816894531	233.255859375	9.9599609375	410.6998748779297	190	Arial
above mentioned average. Hence, the radical right was internally divided along its national	113.41999816894531	248.8858642578125	9.9599609375	410.9178924560547	190	Arial
components much more than any other group of the EP was. Indeed, we only need to recall	113.41999816894531	264.3658447265625	9.9599609375	410.79002380371094	190	Arial
that some ideological diversity also emerged in the Euromanifesto analysis, but strikingly	113.41999816894531	279.84588623046875	9.9599609375	410.7504119873047	190	Arial
wide divisions emerged in the way the radical right MEPs voted in the EP. It is interesting to	113.41999816894531	295.32586669921875	9.9599609375	410.7324676513672	190	Arial

Precisely, among the parties in this group, the UKIP voted against the party line one out of	113.41999816894531	466.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.46177673339844	195	Arial

rather undisciplined conduct and lack of leadership within the political group. Since we	113.41999816894531	528.0258178710938	9.96002197265625	410.39207458496094	195	Arial

defections of the British and the Polish MEPS alone. It follows that the other MEPs of the	113.41999816894531	559.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.56126403808594	195	Arial

interesting to analyze how they behave vis a vis the other parties. One underlying	70.94400024414062	240.20135498046875	9.9744873046875	410.9283142089844	215	Arial
characteristic of radical right parties is indeed their anti-system rhetoric. For this reason, they	70.94400024414062	255.72589111328125	9.9599609375	411.01220703125	215	Arial

organizations (Mudde 2007, 29). Indeed, at the national level, they often reject the system	70.94400024414062	286.68585205078125	9.9599609375	410.7235412597656	215	Arial

available to cartel parties (Katz & Mair1995). Hence, at the national level radical right parties	70.94400024414062	395.16583251953125	9.96002197265625	410.5184631347656	215	Arial

collusive behavior within the EP should not be underestimated (table 9). Although the	70.94400024414062	550.3458862304688	9.96002197265625	410.9271240234375	216	Arial

a parliamentary majority. To be sure, their votes only converged with large majorities	70.94400024414062	612.4158935546875	9.959991455078125	410.49163818359375	216	Arial

Therefore, their vote was not necessary to build minimum winning coalitions, and	70.94400024414062	658.8558349609375	9.959991455078125	410.60113525390625	216	Arial
consequently their blackmail potential and coalition power remained very limited even when	70.94400024414062	674.3358154296875	9.959991455078125	410.7481689453125	216	Arial

Certainly, convergence with the EP majority is also due to the consensual nature of the EP	113.41999816894531	440.0658264160156	9.96002197265625	410.8601531982422	234	Arial

forces that are represented in this assembly. However, even from this perspective, we could	113.41999816894531	471.0258483886719	9.96002197265625	410.9137420654297	234	Arial
not avoid defining the strategy of the radical right in the EP as either one of voice, or one of	113.41999816894531	486.5058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.5092010498047	234	Arial
acquiescence. Being that their votes converged with those of large coalitions and were	113.41999816894531	502.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.95225524902344	234	Arial

IND/DEM was really limited on those occasions, as well as their capacity to influence the	113.41999816894531	533.0658569335938	9.96002197265625	410.41831970214844	234	Arial
final outcome in the decision-making process. Hence, their strategy should really be	113.41999816894531	548.5458374023438	9.96002197265625	410.89903259277344	234	Arial

force the other parties to compromise with them. In the end, it seems that radical right parties	113.41999816894531	579.505859375	9.959991455078125	410.59129333496094	234	Arial
are rather maximalists on the EU in their rhetoric (although even in this respect the analysis	113.41999816894531	595.1358642578125	9.959991455078125	410.69163513183594	234	Arial

radical parties. Alternatively, we could look for other non-strategic explanations of the	70.94400024414062	496.9458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.9263610839844	237	Arial
institutional behavior of radical right MEPs. Just like any other actor who is inserted in the	70.94400024414062	512.4258422851562	9.96002197265625	410.4617004394531	237	Arial
European decision-making system, they become gradually socialized to the practices and	70.94400024414062	528.0258178710938	9.96002197265625	410.5988464355469	237	Arial

that in the long term create a sense of trust and identification with the institution and with the	70.94400024414062	558.98583984375	9.96002197265625	410.8923034667969	237	Arial
system at large (Schimmelfennig 2000). This could also explain why the radical right often	70.94400024414062	574.4658813476562	9.96002197265625	410.5391845703125	237	Arial
takes a more pragmatic stance in the EP than the rhetoric of their central office would	70.94400024414062	589.975830078125	9.959991455078125	410.4717102050781	237	Arial

The analysis that was carried out in this paper shows that the radical right is the party block	113.41999816894531	143.85589599609375	9.9599609375	410.53587341308594	241	Arial

party families. This finding holds true both in the analysis of ideology that was examined	113.41999816894531	174.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.44175720214844	241	Arial
through party Euromanifestos, and in that of institutional behavior shown by the data on the	113.41999816894531	190.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.47496032714844	241	Arial
roll-call votes of the MEPs. The Euroscepticism of the radical right is well-known, however	113.41999816894531	205.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.8759002685547	241	Arial
after an accurate analysis, it showed that it is discontinuous and lacks a common vision	113.41999816894531	221.255859375	9.9599609375	410.93504333496094	241	Arial

The analysis of two different arenas, namely a second-order national electoral arena and the	113.41999816894531	314.4058837890625	9.9599609375	410.80979919433594	242	Arial

antagonism. From the analyses, it emerged that their ideological foundations, programmatic	113.41999816894531	360.9658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.5812225341797	242	Arial

under a distinctive party family name. This finding reinforces Mudde‘s (2007) argument about	113.41999816894531	391.92584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.51158142089844	242	Helvetica
the necessity to classify parties that common wisdom tends to pinpoint within the radical right	113.41999816894531	407.4058532714844	9.96002197265625	410.48167419433594	242	Arial
with more accuracy. Certainly, this paper shows that in Europe, a famille spirituelle grouping	113.41999816894531	423.0113220214844	9.97454833984375	410.97386169433594	242	Arial
the main parties of this political area is, in reality, hardly discernible and even the use of the	113.41999816894531	438.5058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.34226989746094	242	Arial
concept of party family could be incorrect when referring to the radical right.	113.41999816894531	453.98583984375	9.96002197265625	333.42079162597656	242	Arial
At the same time, a clear tendency toward a greater pragmatism and moderation of the	113.41999816894531	485.0658264160156	9.96002197265625	410.58128356933594	243	Arial
MEPs of the radical right emerged in the paper as compared to the party programmatic	113.41999816894531	500.54583740234375	9.96002197265625	410.6610565185547	243	Arial
announcements. Although radical right parties represent a source of opposition within the	113.41999816894531	516.0258178710938	9.96002197265625	410.93467712402344	243	Arial

This phenomenon shows that there is a remarkable distance between the central office and	113.41999816894531	547.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.4517059326172	243	Arial
the public office of these parties, at least in terms of coherence between the statements of	113.41999816894531	562.5858764648438	9.96002197265625	410.9409637451172	243	Arial
the former and the institutional conduct of the latter. Whether this is a conscious, or even a	113.41999816894531	578.06591796875	9.959991455078125	410.4318084716797	243	Arial
strategic game played by these parties, is a question that this paper has not addressed.	113.41999816894531	593.5758056640625	9.959991455078125	410.42198181152344	243	Arial
Certainly, their conduct raises many questions that future research may address. Overall, the	113.41999816894531	609.055908203125	9.959991455078125	410.80821228027344	243	Arial
party public office in the EP is more institutionalized, more inserted in the legislative process	113.41999816894531	624.6558837890625	9.959991455078125	410.43174743652344	243	Arial
and even more collusive with the other parties of both sides of the political spectrum than the	113.41999816894531	640.1358642578125	9.959991455078125	410.48179626464844	243	Arial
rhetoric and statements of central office makes the public believe. The paper documented	113.41999816894531	655.6158447265625	9.959991455078125	410.6636199951172	243	Arial
the ambivalence between a more Eurosceptical party central office and a more collusive EP	113.41999816894531	671.0958251953125	9.959991455078125	410.78050231933594	243	Arial
public office. This conflicting valence between central office and public office could be a sign	113.41999816894531	686.5758056640625	9.959991455078125	410.97154235839844	243	Arial
of difficulty for these parties in playing the role of legislators and, at the same time, represent	113.41999816894531	702.055908203125	9.959991455078125	410.3024139404297	243	Arial
a protest-based electorate. Especially in an assembly like the EP where there is not a clear	113.41999816894531	717.6558227539062	9.959999084472656	410.51341247558594	243	Arial
