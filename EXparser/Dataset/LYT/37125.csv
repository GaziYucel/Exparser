This volume presents several authors who are developing research projects in various European	108.0199966430664	417.8089294433594	12.0	431.63997650146484	7	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

of the empirical observations and results reported here, there is something which unites them all, namely a	72.02400207519531	445.3089294433594	12.0	467.5082244873047	7	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
certain similarity in looking at things from a political culture perspective. Moreover, there is something else	72.02400207519531	459.0918273925781	12.017120361328125	467.6361541748047	7	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

It is this need for explanation which makes the true binding – either implicit or explicit – of this	108.0199966430664	527.9889526367188	12.0	432.1880111694336	7	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

The need for explanation should not surprise anybody, especially if we are to study the Eastern	108.0199966430664	100.49896240234375	12.0	431.5201644897461	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
European politics. Nevertheless, it is more than just the necessity to explain (what?) and how? is going on	72.02400207519531	114.16180419921875	12.01715087890625	468.1000213623047	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
in politics. It is also the need to understand why?, when?, or what for? The long transition processes from	72.02400207519531	127.96185302734375	12.01715087890625	468.02195739746094	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
the communist to democratic regimes made almost all Eastern European people and their countries	72.02400207519531	141.77899169921875	12.0	468.1840057373047	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
experience during the past two decades the need to explain their choices, values, beliefs, norms, attitudes,	72.02400207519531	155.458984375	12.0	467.42417907714844	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
and symbols. Their grievances or prejudices. Their institutions, regimes, and discourses. All these entail a	72.02400207519531	169.25897216796875	12.0	467.52012634277344	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
deep understanding of both remote cultural roots and current political perceptions, steadiness and	72.02400207519531	183.0589599609375	12.0	467.7981414794922	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
variability, contingency and necessity, change and resistance to change. They require not only to explain	72.02400207519531	196.85894775390625	12.0	467.4841766357422	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
things. First and foremost, they require a concept, a paradigm, and a method. It often requires a model.	72.02400207519531	210.5218505859375	12.01715087890625	448.73204040527344	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
The modeling idea is as old as our philosophical thinking. It reminds us of Plato and makes us think	108.0199966430664	224.3389892578125	12.0	431.5799789428711	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
about the city, world, society and politics as of imperfect shadows of one perfect idea. To understand them,	72.02400207519531	238.13897705078125	12.0	467.4481658935547	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
we need first of all to overlap the “real” and the “ideal”, the “shadows” and the “model”. It is this overlapping	72.02400207519531	251.968994140625	12.0	467.4858856201172	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
which explains what the real construct – be it society or polity, tradition or institution, individual action or	72.02400207519531	265.64898681640625	12.0	467.8101043701172	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
policy – actually needs in order to identify itself with the ideal construct.	72.02400207519531	279.448974609375	11.999969482421875	308.69801330566406	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
Modeling is, as a matter of fact, a relevant component of Political Science: ideology, political	108.0199966430664	293.2489318847656	12.0	431.5920639038086	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
regime, state, governance or voting – all of them have been modeled and analyzed by means of models.	72.02400207519531	307.0489501953125	12.0	454.6582489013672	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
Before anything else, a model “explains” the real world by capturing few but universal laws,	108.0199966430664	320.72894287109375	12.0	431.85005950927734	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
principles. It thus makes both modeler and user develop expectations with respect to its explanative power.	72.02400207519531	334.5289306640625	12.0	467.52012634277344	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
Whether these are finally fulfilled or not, this depends on the model. In the classical approach, models as	72.02400207519531	348.3289489746094	12.0	468.1000213623047	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
explanative tools involve covering laws. For example, economic laws and ideas do explain the	72.02400207519531	362.1289367675781	12.0	467.6282196044922	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
transformation processes in the Eastern European newly appeared democracies, but they cannot fully	72.02400207519531	375.8089294433594	12.0	467.55601501464844	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
explain them, and obviously not them all.	72.02400207519531	389.60894775390625	12.0	177.64796447753906	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
After the first decade following the 1989- Eastern European political phenomena, students of	108.0199966430664	403.408935546875	12.0	431.8701400756836	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
democracy identified the main characteristics of the Eastern European transition to democratic regime	72.02400207519531	417.2089538574219	12.0	467.5798797607422	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
processes and tried to explain their unfolding. It was probably the first time when many agreed that, beyond	72.02400207519531	430.908935546875	12.0	467.8779754638672	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
economical difficulties, there were some others which did not fit this model and resisted explanations based	72.02400207519531	444.7089538574219	12.0	467.4961395263672	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
on covering economical laws. Explaining politics requires more than social, economical and financial	72.02400207519531	458.5089416503906	12.0	468.2400360107422	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
methodologies altogether: it requires political methodology. Moreover, it requires a political methodology	72.02400207519531	472.3089294433594	12.0	467.56822204589844	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
able to reconsider such issues like variability, context-, path- and initial conditions dependence in order to	72.02400207519531	485.98895263671875	12.0	467.8661346435547	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
explain one of the fundamental questions in the post-1989 political analysis and methodology (Tilly, 1995):	72.02400207519531	499.7889404296875	12.0	467.90208435058594	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
how should we study the political change? – Long after the 1989 Eastern European political phenomena,	72.02400207519531	513.5889892578125	12.0	467.7501678466797	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
people still argued on the nature of political change, on its real target and on its real means and ends.	72.02400207519531	527.3889770507812	12.000015258789062	468.04002380371094	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
Invariable models of political change could not tackle anymore the complexity of the political history and	72.02400207519531	541.0689697265625	12.0	467.5320281982422	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
failed to fulfill the need for explanation of both scholars, either old or young, and of the people, either	72.02400207519531	554.8689575195312	12.0	467.4719696044922	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
ordinary people or elites.	72.02400207519531	568.6689453125	12.0	107.82798767089844	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
Unavoidably, political culture came to the front. In spite of the hard critics and apparently never	108.0199966430664	582.468994140625	12.0	431.57991790771484	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
ending disputes, political culture theories have suceeded to find room for “impressive” coming-backs	72.02400207519531	596.178955078125	12.0	468.17198181152344	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
(Mishler and Pollack, 2003) and for managing ambiguity in definitions and terminology. It is not the first time	72.02400207519531	609.9789428710938	12.0	467.7141571044922	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
when they do come back and, most probably, not the last. However, this time there is something missing in	72.02400207519531	623.7789306640625	12.0	467.4719696044922	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
the room: explanative power requires explanative methodology. And a good explanation methodology	72.02400207519531	637.5789794921875	12.0	468.1119842529297	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
cannot ignore or avoid modeling. Nevertheless, it is modeling which is actually missing in this room.	72.02400207519531	651.2589721679688	12.0	431.9640655517578	14	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

present volume. The Conclusions show that the Eastern European political culture research exhibits	72.02400207519531	100.49896240234375	12.0	468.0699920654297	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
preferences for a particular relationship between (i) the political values, identity, behaviors and attitudes	72.02400207519531	114.178955078125	12.0	467.44798278808594	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
modeling, on the one hand, and for (ii) the generative simulation modeling of political phenomena, on the	72.02400207519531	127.97900390625	12.0	467.36399841308594	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
other hand. This relationship is described as a political methodological relationship between political	72.02400207519531	141.7618408203125	12.01715087890625	468.19602966308594	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

Getting back to the rationale of this volume, we should emphasize again the independent character	108.0199966430664	169.25897216796875	12.0	431.6281967163086	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
of the researches presented in this volume. It is important to do this for three reasons. One relates their	72.02400207519531	183.0589599609375	12.0	467.6779022216797	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
independent character to the reality that Eastern European political science research is guided from within	72.02400207519531	196.85894775390625	12.0	467.38804626464844	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
the society, and this proves both the awareness of researchers and the social utility of their approaches.	72.02400207519531	210.53900146484375	12.0	467.9499969482422	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
Another one relates the scarce appearances of political culture modeling research in Eastern Europe to the	72.02400207519531	224.3389892578125	12.0	467.44822692871094	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
scarcity of its research funding, which seriously limits its development, but nevertheless cannot stop it. And	72.02400207519531	238.13897705078125	12.0	467.54417419433594	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
finally, a third reason concerns the extension of political culture theories so as to include new elements	72.02400207519531	251.968994140625	12.0	467.5201873779297	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

researches included in the volume share a major theoretical tendency towards modeling approaches of	72.02400207519531	320.72894287109375	12.0	467.9141082763672	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

type of democracy constructs elaborated by the Eastern European countries, and (2) political identity,	72.02400207519531	403.408935546875	12.0	467.60398864746094	24	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
