prosocial thoughts. Thus, these results provide first evidence for the hypothesis that exposure	92.63446044921875	275.6500244140625	11.2794189453125	420.42706298828125	33	Times-Roman

reactions through these internal states. Thus, future research assessing internal states as well	92.634521484375	249.7313232421875	11.2794189453125	415.31488037109375	51	Times-Roman
as behavioral reactions in one study would be informative in this regard. Nevertheless, based	92.63436889648438	275.6500244140625	11.2794189453125	418.8987121582031	51	Times-Roman
on the present results, it appears that the aim of GLM to bring the effects of media exposure	92.63400268554688	301.5686950683594	11.279449462890625	414.9073181152344	51	Times-Roman
on pro- and antisocial tendencies together within a common theoretical framework is not only	92.63375854492188	327.4873962402344	11.279449462890625	423.2184143066406	51	Times-Roman
a valuable endeavor, but is also supported by empirical evidence.	92.63333129882812	353.4060974121094	11.279449462890625	294.045166015625	51	Times-Roman
Previous research has demonstrated that violent media increased aggression and	125.87152099609375	379.4447937011719	11.279449462890625	361.3016357421875	51	Times-Roman
decreased prosocial behavior (Anderson & Bushman, 2001). Here, evidence was presented	92.63287353515625	405.3634948730469	11.279449462890625	410.0191955566406	51	Times-Roman
that listening to prosocial songs increased prosocial behavior. Thus, future research may	92.63259887695312	431.2821960449219	11.279449462890625	398.2598876953125	51	Times-Roman

The reader should be well aware that the present results are limited to the short-term:	125.8702392578125	509.1582946777344	11.279449462890625	383.5163879394531	51	Times-Roman
the effects of listening to prosocial songs on immediate thoughts, affects, and behaviors were	92.63165283203125	534.95703125	11.279449462890625	420.0670166015625	51	Times-Roman
