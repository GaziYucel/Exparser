In order to pursue these questions we present analyses of two very different cases that	124.74181365966797	430.61627197265625	8.519989013671875	343.0646438598633	19	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

sexual abuse by a priest. Furthermore, she was always rejected by other children	113.39999389648438	676.6886596679688	9.479995727539062	354.3265380859375	42	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

In Emma’s case, the difficulty concerning intergenerational transmission seems to	113.4000015258789	212.6492919921875	9.47998046875	354.3425521850586	47	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

For a long time, Emma was ashamed of her family and of where she came from.	124.73997497558594	267.6693115234375	9.47998046875	343.0110321044922	47	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

her to refer to her family in any positive way. For Emma, everything seemed to be	113.4000015258789	289.689453125	9.47998046875	354.26280975341797	47	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
negative and destructive.	113.4000015258789	300.669189453125	9.47998046875	108.54219818115234	47	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

strong. I was sometimes making up a story, not to say where I come from. I was	147.4195098876953	346.6148681640625	8.519989013671875	320.3179473876953	48	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

Here Emma expresses the shame she felt, and explains the temptation of trying to	113.4000015258789	401.649658203125	9.47998046875	354.3347396850586	49	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
fend off this shame. This period seems to be difficult for her; she does not want to	113.4000015258789	412.6900634765625	9.47998046875	354.3879928588867	49	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
be in the line of her parents’ descent. But even though the negligence, mistreat-	113.4000015258789	423.6697998046875	9.47998046875	354.2865219116211	49	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

she later on developed something in common with them, some specific memories	113.4000015258789	445.68994140625	9.47998046875	354.3849105834961	49	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
which are mentioned in her talks. A part of what has been passed on to her was	113.4000015258789	456.669677734375	9.47998046875	354.41259002685547	49	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
hard to accept for a while: her face, first name and surname are visible traces of	113.40000915527344	467.6494140625	9.47998046875	354.40220642089844	49	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
what she represents for people. We can see in this interview extract that Emma	113.40000915527344	478.6898193359375	9.47998046875	354.32154846191406	49	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
had experiences of racist discrimination at different moments in her life course.	113.40000915527344	489.6695556640625	9.47998046875	354.3044891357422	49	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

was confronted with – to be considered just as Arab while she just wanted to be	113.40000915527344	511.689697265625	9.47998046875	354.3319549560547	49	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

Emma: […] it’s true, I always loved my job, it was all I could do to prove to humanity	113.4000015258789	549.5941162109375	8.652191162109375	354.35363006591797	50	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
that I could do something good, because during all this time, even during the in-	147.4195098876953	559.614501953125	8.519989013671875	320.36827087402344	50	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
ternships, people considered me a dirty Arab. In so far that I sometimes treat	147.4195098876953	569.5743408203125	8.519989013671875	320.2259063720703	50	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
myself as a dirty Arab too although I never recognized myself as Arab. Quickly I	147.4195098876953	579.5947265625	8.519989013671875	320.2941131591797	50	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
changed my first name, when they asked where I come from. I couldn’t say that I	147.4195098876953	589.6151123046875	8.520004272460938	320.3519744873047	50	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
was Tunisian, because for me it was the reflection of my father and my mother	147.4195098876953	599.574951171875	8.520004272460938	320.39878845214844	50	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

looking for a job. She felt protected from people’s opinions but also from what she	113.4000015258789	667.6895751953125	9.479995727539062	354.31700897216797	51	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
disclosed about herself. Emma did not recognize herself in other people’s regard	113.4000015258789	678.6693115234375	9.479995727539062	354.50838470458984	51	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
and could not consider herself as a part of her parents’ cultural origin.	113.40000915527344	689.6490478515625	9.479995727539062	300.4353790283203	51	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

strong issues for Emma because it is central to her identity construction and her	113.40000915527344	159.66937255859375	9.47998046875	354.45811462402344	54	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
relation to others. It is impossible to override this set of problems, precisely for	113.40000915527344	170.64910888671875	9.47998046875	354.38890075683594	54	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

when these elements are distorted by a violent climate of mistreatment? Emma’s	113.40000915527344	203.64898681640625	9.47998046875	354.3273162841797	54	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
speech reflects this ambivalence very well: on the one hand, the paradox consists	113.40000915527344	214.68939208984375	9.47998046875	354.3056182861328	54	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
in dismissing the elements that could lead to her origins, because she does not	113.40000915527344	225.66912841796875	9.47998046875	354.34251403808594	54	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
identify with them. On the other hand, she describes a possible “return to origins”	113.40000915527344	236.64886474609375	9.47998046875	354.4059600830078	54	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
– in this case reverting to her real first name – as an act of bravery.	113.40000915527344	247.68927001953125	9.47998046875	289.5712432861328	54	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

In Emma’s case, there seem to be two main aspects which come into play when	113.40000915527344	302.6505126953125	9.47998046875	354.37294006347656	56	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
she reinterprets what has been passed on: time and the necessity to draft her own	113.40000915527344	313.69091796875	9.47998046875	354.26087951660156	56	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
life and her concept of self. Emma needed time to take a different look at how she	113.40000915527344	324.670654296875	9.47998046875	354.37770080566406	56	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
suffered, and building her own family was significant for the reinterpretation of	113.40000915527344	335.650390625	9.47998046875	354.30079650878906	56	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
her life course. Studies on fostering often deal with the dimension of time: the	113.40000915527344	346.6907958984375	9.47998046875	354.37379455566406	56	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

Here Emma manages to point out the positive elements that her parents passed	113.4000015258789	528.669677734375	9.480010986328125	354.3607406616211	58	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

However, using the term “camp” already seems misleading here, as it is usually	113.40000915527344	508.689208984375	9.47998046875	354.4361114501953	70	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

and statements. In contradiction to this, however, there is the everyday individual	113.40007019042969	596.6484375	9.479995727539062	354.3870391845703	70	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

which finds its expression in the construction of three- or four-story apartment	113.40097045898438	618.6685791015625	9.479995727539062	354.28070068359375	70	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

The participants in the first group interview were four boys and seven girls	124.73959350585938	401.64898681640625	9.47998046875	343.0451354980469	75	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

ning the youths were asked to talk about the history of their group, and how they	113.39962005615234	423.66912841796875	9.47998046875	354.3993606567383	75	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
got to know each other. The first one to answer was one of the girls, Yasmeen (15),	113.39962005615234	434.64886474609375	9.47998046875	354.40979766845703	75	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
who introduced the group as the “fifth generation” of the Markaz Dabka Troupe.	113.39962005615234	445.68927001953125	9.47998046875	354.3168411254883	75	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
With this explicit reference to the term “generation” she directly located the group	113.39961242675781	456.66900634765625	9.47998046875	354.28172302246094	75	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

militant struggle for “return” among the three generations of refugees, which one	113.39962768554688	522.6687622070312	9.47998046875	354.3216247558594	75	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
of the boys, 16-year-old Maher, described later in this interview:	113.39962768554688	533.6484985351562	9.47998046875	275.092529296875	75	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

him about the ongoing “revolution,” he does not contextualize this conversation in	113.40008544921875	658.6900634765625	9.479995727539062	354.3233947753906	77	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

practice; this, in turn, can be interpreted as an indicator of the ubiquity of the	113.4000015258789	148.68963623046875	9.47998046875	354.35472869873047	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
narrative in the camp. Moreover, Maher does not mention his own reaction to his	113.4000015258789	159.66937255859375	9.47998046875	354.3187789916992	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
father’s demand, it does not appear as a vocal interaction but as a message that is	113.40000915527344	170.64910888671875	9.47998046875	354.36427307128906	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
received and accepted, giving the impression of a vertical, one-way direction of	113.40000915527344	181.68951416015625	9.47998046875	354.4032745361328	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
transmission. Accordingly, he presents an argumentation: “you have to struggle,	113.40000915527344	192.66925048828125	9.599609375	354.36900329589844	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
you have to do something” because of the fact that they live in a camp, that	113.40097045898438	203.64898681640625	9.47998046875	354.3755187988281	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
“friends,” supposedly of his own generation, died or were serving prison sentences	113.40097045898438	214.68939208984375	9.47998046875	354.3494567871094	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
– both presumably because of confrontations with the Israeli security forces. How-	113.40097045898438	225.66912841796875	9.47998046875	354.51702880859375	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
ever, although the concrete means of “struggle” to which the group refers are not	113.40097045898438	236.64886474609375	9.47998046875	354.3045959472656	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
outlined so far, the demand to struggle here was described as an almost “natural”	113.40097045898438	247.68927001953125	9.47998046875	354.36053466796875	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
or logical result of the situation. Still, the argumentative form seems to indicate a	113.40097045898438	258.66900634765625	9.47998046875	354.3727722167969	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
certain social pressure to engage in the struggle, a pressure that is not only	113.40097045898438	269.64874267578125	9.47998046875	354.3558044433594	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
passed on by the older generation but also exerted within peer relationships.	113.40097045898438	280.68914794921875	9.47998046875	328.52947998046875	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
This argumentative mode also characterized the following course of the inter-	124.7409439086914	291.66888427734375	9.47998046875	342.91426849365234	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
view, when Maher and Adnan took turns in presenting long statements, talking	113.40097045898438	302.64862060546875	9.47998046875	354.3359375	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
about the general situation at the checkpoints, the imprisonment of minors etc.	113.40097045898438	313.68902587890625	9.47998046875	354.3746032714844	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
Sometimes these statements also referred to their own practice as a dabka group,	113.40098571777344	324.66876220703125	9.599609375	354.4154510498047	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
which the interviewer was able to attend later. In these shows, the youths com-	113.40194702148438	335.64849853515625	9.47998046875	354.275146484375	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

ticulate any monologues or dialogues, or sing songs themselves, which might have	113.40292358398438	357.66864013671875	9.47998046875	354.36236572265625	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
given the performance or the enacted character a more individual or personal	113.40292358398438	368.64837646484375	9.47998046875	354.3235168457031	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
touch. Instead, the narration that went along with the show came from a recorded	113.40292358398438	379.68878173828125	9.47998046875	354.3994445800781	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
CD, just like the music, and the actors would dance and perform to it. The youths	113.40292358398438	390.66851806640625	9.47998046875	354.3776550292969	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
enacted the Nakba and the ongoing political and militant struggle against Israel.	113.40292358398438	401.64825439453125	9.599609375	354.4249572753906	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
Moreover, they enacted the transmission of the mission to “return” from the older	113.40290832519531	412.68865966796875	9.47998046875	354.38218688964844	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
to the younger generation: in the respective scene, one of the actors would die as a	113.40290832519531	423.66839599609375	9.47998046875	354.3206024169922	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

it, stating that it was the most precious and meaningful asset on earth – a mission	113.40290832519531	456.66827392578125	9.47998046875	354.38404846191406	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
the son willingly accepted and re-enacted, with the other actors rising, joining in,	113.40290832519531	467.64801025390625	9.47998046875	354.30934143066406	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

But in spite of this militant presentation the youths affirmed already in this	124.74288177490234	489.66815185546875	9.47998046875	343.0147171020508	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
first interview that “throwing stones” had not had the desired political effect, but	113.40289306640625	500.64788818359375	9.47998046875	354.4238586425781	80	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

as a trainer for the dabka troupe. Moreover, he relates an encounter in which, as	113.39999389648438	259.689697265625	9.599609375	354.3975830078125	85	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
it seems, a president of another cultural center praises and compliments the	113.39904022216797	270.66943359375	9.47998046875	354.41931915283203	85	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

tion: When the revolution “happens again,” Adnan has to decide if he “accepts and	113.39904022216797	314.6490478515625	9.47998046875	354.20890045166016	85	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

and the individual right – to choose how to support the struggle. Whereas Adnan	113.3990478515625	369.6690673828125	9.599609375	354.31494140625	85	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
describes the past shortly as a trajectory of suffering – characterized by a loss of	113.3990478515625	380.6488037109375	9.47998046875	354.29791259765625	85	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook

way for strategic reflection. Accordingly, one can assume that dabka serves indeed	113.3990478515625	402.6689453125	9.599609375	354.3377380371094	85	NJHNPH+CenturySchoolbook
