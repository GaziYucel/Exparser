EU-institutions themselves are much more heterogeneous and in a process of	85.08001708984375	456.1097106933594	12.0	439.3511962890625	5	ArialMT

Factors influencing the arena of negotiations are, firstly, whether participants are -	85.08000183105469	566.5098266601562	12.0	439.3151397705078	5	ArialMT

second vector of influence is based on the national background and on domestic	85.07997131347656	621.7098388671875	12.0	439.23838806152344	5	ArialMT

asymmetrical power constellations during the accession process, how can, after	85.07998657226562	335.08978271484375	12.0	439.2502746582031	11	ArialMT

In general, these lengthy negotiations were characterized by participants of the	85.08000183105469	569.6898193359375	12.0	439.29969787597656	13	ArialMT
new Member States as a “real learning area” and a “healthy ferment”3. This means	85.08000183105469	581.0082397460938	14.48162841796875	439.3667755126953	13	ArialMT

Finally, this leads to the perception that even several years after the accession still	85.08000183105469	307.48980712890625	12.0	439.3380889892578	18	ArialMT
asymmetrical forms of bargaining and negotiations can be seen and that,	85.08001708984375	321.289794921875	12.0	439.275634765625	18	ArialMT

Therefore, the capacity for a clever and early positioning in these contexts has a	85.0799560546875	459.289794921875	12.0	439.36798095703125	19	ArialMT

This means that the 12 new Member States are dealt with in “stability and convergence	85.0797119140625	701.396240234375	10.020004272460938	439.37908935546875	21	ArialMT

sector potential: This means that cohesion policy involves environmental aspects,	85.08001708984375	86.74981689453125	12.0	439.384765625	23	ArialMT
enlargement and energy policy as well as the second pillar of CAP, the rural	85.08001708984375	100.5498046875	12.0	439.3812255859375	23	ArialMT

Factors influencing the actual arena of negotiations are, firstly, whether	85.08000183105469	141.9498291015625	12.0	439.29237365722656	24	ArialMT
participants are - at a societal-cultural level - able to react in an adequate manner.	85.08000183105469	155.74981689453125	12.0	439.2766876220703	24	ArialMT
This personal disposition is based on working experience and the study	85.08000183105469	169.5498046875	12.0	439.3980255126953	24	ArialMT
background, thus the level of socialisation in an international and European-	85.08000183105469	183.34979248046875	12.0	439.2383575439453	24	ArialMT
oriented context. To what extend does the new generation of staff already	85.08001708984375	197.08978271484375	12.0	439.2803955078125	24	ArialMT
represent modern diplomats for Europe? The second vector of influence is based	85.08001708984375	210.8897705078125	12.0	439.38720703125	24	ArialMT
on the national background and on domestic politics: Which is the room of	85.08004760742188	224.68975830078125	12.0	439.3439636230469	24	ArialMT
manoeuvre for participants to act as promoter or transmitter? In other words, when	85.08004760742188	238.48974609375	12.0	439.4303894042969	24	ArialMT
it comes to the contextualisation of actors’ behaviour the level of independence is	85.08004760742188	252.28973388671875	12.0	439.2815856933594	24	ArialMT
important: To which degree are persons involved able to speak in the name of the	85.08004760742188	266.0897216796875	12.0	439.2996520996094	24	ArialMT
EU-Institution and thus to transmit the philosophy of the relevant EU institution6?	85.08004760742188	277.408203125	14.48162841796875	439.3319396972656	24	ArialMT
To what extent does a general consensus among elites (and the public) exist that	85.07998657226562	293.6898193359375	12.0	439.2516174316406	24	ArialMT
EU membership is beneficial in the long run? To combine the factors: What kind of	85.07998657226562	307.48980712890625	12.0	439.2623596191406	24	ArialMT
coalitions are actors of the Brussels scene willing (personally) and able (externally	85.07998657226562	321.289794921875	12.0	439.3056335449219	24	ArialMT
dominated or influenced) to form? These questions are coupled with the	85.07998657226562	335.08978271484375	12.0	439.3559875488281	24	ArialMT
necessary acceptance of the open-endedness of decision-making and the fact that	85.08000183105469	348.8897705078125	12.0	439.2936553955078	24	ArialMT
benefits are long-termed and somewhat abstract (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004).	85.08000183105469	362.68975830078125	12.0	405.4355926513672	24	ArialMT
The expected outcome is the application of refined negotiation capacities which	85.08000183105469	390.2898254394531	12.0	439.3463897705078	25	ArialMT
include an openness for mutual dialogue and the ability to create incentives for a	85.07998657226562	404.0898132324219	12.0	439.3799743652344	25	ArialMT

creative niches. Thereby, an increasingly European-oriented motivation of	85.08004760742188	542.0897216796875	12.0	439.3163757324219	25	ArialMT

are combined with several non-economic issues such as ecologist, gender and	85.07998657226562	321.289794921875	12.0	439.2768859863281	47	ArialMT
lifestyle (Marks et al 2006: 157). In other words this implies norms and rules set by	85.07998657226562	335.08978271484375	12.0	439.3320007324219	47	ArialMT
EU institutions to handle e.g. EU Cohesion Policy and the European employment	85.07998657226562	348.8897705078125	12.0	439.3200378417969	47	ArialMT
policy, thus the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, and cross-sections such as	85.07998657226562	362.68975830078125	12.017730712890625	439.3080139160156	47	Arial-ItalicMT
the urban dimension, innovation policy, environmental protection, sustainable	85.07998657226562	376.48974609375	12.0	439.3655700683594	47	ArialMT
growth and even enlargement and energy policy. These consolidated ideals of	85.07998657226562	390.28973388671875	12.0	439.2527770996094	47	ArialMT
Western civilization also affect procedural aspects such as participatory decision-	85.07998657226562	404.0897216796875	12.0	439.2480163574219	47	ArialMT
making. In this logic e.g. the European Parliament is the embodiment of issues	85.07997131347656	417.88970947265625	12.017730712890625	439.36314392089844	47	Arial-ItalicMT
such as regionalization, culture, support of cultural and linguistic diversity as well	85.0799560546875	431.689697265625	12.0	439.315185546875	47	ArialMT
as social and territorial cohesion, which is now even codified in the Treaty of	85.07992553710938	445.48968505859375	12.017730712890625	439.3547668457031	47	Arial-ItalicMT

Given the political and economic transnationalization, which European integration	85.08000183105469	486.8898010253906	12.0	439.3656768798828	48	ArialMT
implies, it has to be reflected that the state is still a central agent and a centre	85.08000183105469	500.6898193359375	12.0	439.2887725830078	48	ArialMT

democratization (Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 8ff.). Moreover, it is important to	85.08001708984375	528.289794921875	12.0	439.40765380859375	48	ArialMT
understand the domestic context of party competition in order to gain a full picture	85.08001708984375	542.0897216796875	12.0	439.3367919921875	48	ArialMT
of the context for national elite positions on European integration	85.08003234863281	555.8897705078125	12.0	439.2479705810547	48	ArialMT
(Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004: 17f.). In other words, parties can be considered as	85.08001708984375	569.689697265625	12.0	439.25518798828125	48	ArialMT
gatekeepers for European interaction: European argumentation is closely related	85.08001708984375	583.48974609375	12.0	439.33197021484375	48	ArialMT
to positions in their party systems (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004: 2). Consequently,	85.08001708984375	597.2897338867188	12.0	439.4075927734375	48	ArialMT
actors of the Brussels scene are through direct or indirect party affinity embedded	85.08001708984375	611.0897216796875	12.0	439.3800048828125	48	ArialMT
in different frames of political thinking, which implies understandings of a certain	85.08001708984375	624.8897705078125	12.0	439.33917236328125	48	ArialMT

addition, he was Vice-Director of the European-oriented University of Natolin, Poland.	85.07710266113281	761.1612548828125	10.019996643066406	377.3622283935547	49	ArialMT

disintegrative and exclusionary dynamics within societies. It is a discernible pattern	85.08000183105469	72.9498291015625	12.0	439.42323303222656	51	ArialMT
that it is easier for actors of oppositional parties to support pro-European views	85.08000183105469	86.74981689453125	12.0	439.30799865722656	51	ArialMT
and of having an increased interest to demonstrate leadership	85.07998657226562	100.5498046875	12.0	439.3631896972656	51	ArialMT
(Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004). The capacity for strategic thinking and the addressee-	85.07998657226562	114.34979248046875	12.0	439.2768249511719	51	ArialMT
orientation among politicians and administrative staff of the Brussels scene also	85.07998657226562	128.1497802734375	12.0	439.3716125488281	51	ArialMT
depends on the frequency of governmental changes: Political changes might be	85.07998657226562	141.94976806640625	12.0	439.3752136230469	51	ArialMT
coupled with a shuffling of personnel and thematic reorientations as well as with	85.07998657226562	155.749755859375	12.0	439.3259582519531	51	ArialMT

As to the second factor it can be stated that Polish political activists for regional	85.08000183105469	197.08984375	12.0	439.3488311767578	52	ArialMT
policy of the Brussels scene are predominately pro-market libertarian oriented.	85.08001708984375	210.88983154296875	12.0	439.286376953125	52	ArialMT
This means that their party affiliation allows them - as concerns EU issues - to	85.08001708984375	224.6898193359375	12.0	439.4088134765625	52	ArialMT

decision-making (Henderson 2001: 10 in Marks et al 2006: 168). While parties	85.08001708984375	252.289794921875	12.0	439.40875244140625	52	ArialMT

position to argue more quality than quantity-oriented, together with a view on side-	85.08001708984375	293.68975830078125	12.0	439.3079833984375	52	ArialMT
policy fields: Given that opposition party members were nationally not directly	85.08004760742188	307.48974609375	12.0	439.2528381347656	52	ArialMT
responsible for the negotiation outcomes of the Councils of Ministers, they have	85.08004760742188	321.28973388671875	12.017730712890625	439.3919982910156	52	Arial-ItalicMT
had the freedom to think in different categories and to carve out creative niches	85.080078125	335.0897216796875	12.0	439.2587890625	52	ArialMT
while articulating political-societal projects. In this logic they could use the moral	85.08009338378906	348.88970947265625	12.0	439.33799743652344	52	ArialMT
embeddedness and integrational power of the relevant EU institution (and the	85.080078125	362.689697265625	12.0	439.362060546875	52	ArialMT
party family) for their transnational argumentation, while demonstrating an	85.080078125	376.48968505859375	12.0	439.3067626953125	52	ArialMT
openness for different regulatory ideas and an abandoning of nationally embedded	85.08006286621094	390.2896728515625	12.0	439.33314514160156	52	ArialMT
practices of norm- and rule-setting. This tendency is supported by the Polish	85.08004760742188	404.08966064453125	12.0	439.2912292480469	52	ArialMT

The negotiation potential of actors of the New Member States	85.08000183105469	459.67510986328125	12.0	349.3679962158203	53	Arial-BoldMT
In the empirical part three examples are highlighted to illuminate the power of the	85.08000183105469	486.8898010253906	12.0	439.35597229003906	54	ArialMT
alleged peripheral group of EU-8. That means that the management of structural	85.07998657226562	500.6898193359375	12.0	439.4016418457031	54	ArialMT
mismatches might be beneficial for the so called outsiders. This inferior position	85.07998657226562	514.48974609375	12.0	439.3835754394531	54	ArialMT
enables actors of this inner circle vis-à-vis their negotiation partners to	85.07998657226562	528.289794921875	12.0177001953125	371.6112365722656	54	Arial-ItalicMT
- be taken as an example because they have an openness for new thematic	103.08000183105469	542.08984375	12.0	412.98121643066406	54	ArialMT

- introduce or suggest new and creative ways of thinking;	103.08000183105469	569.6898193359375	12.0	312.8136749267578	54	ArialMT
- have the “right” to act in a contra-factual way, which might at first sight	103.08000183105469	583.4898071289062	12.000015258789062	389.4719696044922	54	ArialMT

Due to the similar authoritarian legacy, the commonly shared accession process,	85.08000183105469	624.8898315429688	12.0	439.23719787597656	55	ArialMT
thus the experience of “Europeanization from scratch” there is less diversity and	85.08001708984375	638.6898193359375	12.0	439.3380126953125	55	ArialMT
more bunching among the EU-8. Seen from the socio-economic angle, the group	85.08004760742188	652.4898681640625	12.0	439.3523864746094	55	ArialMT

intensity of structural funds and CAP allowances. Within this new embeddedness,	85.08004760742188	680.08984375	12.0	439.2359924316406	55	ArialMT
some communities or clusters might again take the leadership: This might be true	85.08004760742188	693.8898315429688	12.0	439.4039611816406	55	ArialMT

To gain an insight into the potential of the EU-8, three examples are highlighted in	85.08000183105469	197.08984375	12.0	439.3056182861328	60	ArialMT

upgrade of the goal of territorial cohesion stems from the European Parliament in	85.08001708984375	279.88983154296875	12.01776123046875	439.39801025390625	62	Arial-ItalicMT

(as to the Reform Treaty), the enthusiastic advocacy for the introduction of the	85.08001708984375	128.1497802734375	12.01776123046875	439.38482666015625	66	Arial-ItalicMT

To sum up, the notion of territorial cohesion not only respects the principle of the	85.08000183105469	169.5498046875	12.0	439.3583526611328	67	ArialMT

The second example scrutinizes the policy-making process for the introduction of	85.08000183105469	252.289794921875	12.0	439.3379669189453	69	ArialMT

to policy framing the stress on the theme of housing underlines the importance of	85.08001708984375	279.8897705078125	12.01776123046875	439.25042724609375	69	Arial-ItalicMT
the urban dimension and could be interpreted as a contribution to discussions of	85.08004760742188	293.68975830078125	12.0	439.3295593261719	69	ArialMT

Based on the family of nation’s argument the introduction of this theme has been	85.08000183105469	362.6898193359375	12.0	439.3463897705078	70	ArialMT

the General Provision of EU cohesion policy in mid-2006 was remarkable, since	85.07998657226562	417.8897705078125	12.017730712890625	439.3318786621094	70	Arial-ItalicMT
the financing of housing aspects happens for the first time ever. In general, it	85.07998657226562	431.68975830078125	12.0	439.2768859863281	70	ArialMT
follows the actual European-wide tendency that the urban dimension is	85.07998657226562	445.48974609375	12.0	439.3103942871094	70	ArialMT

the same political fraction, sharing the affinity of the principle of “open innovation”.	85.08001708984375	335.08978271484375	12.0	439.25152587890625	78	ArialMT
Moreover, Mr Janowski is a regionally based advocate for the necessary	85.08001708984375	348.8897705078125	12.0	439.31402587890625	78	ArialMT
information campaign as to the broad application of instruments such as Jeremie	85.08001708984375	362.68975830078125	12.017730712890625	439.3800048828125	78	Arial-ItalicMT
and Jaspers. In consequence, Poland was among the first to open a liaison office	85.08004760742188	376.48974609375	12.017730712890625	439.3487854003906	78	Arial-ItalicMT
in Warsaw in 2007 for Jaspers: While showing a great amount of goodwill, the	85.08004760742188	390.28973388671875	12.017730712890625	439.2707824707031	78	Arial-ItalicMT
Polish authorities’ part of the Brussels scene are regarded as forerunners.	85.08001708984375	404.0897216796875	12.0	439.1951904296875	78	ArialMT
Moreover, based on the Twinning experience, regular networking conferences	85.08003234863281	417.88970947265625	12.017730712890625	439.27439880371094	78	Arial-ItalicMT

bilaterally exchanging experience, promoting increased cooperation and improving	85.07998657226562	445.48968505859375	12.0	439.3824157714844	78	ArialMT
the coordination between relevant actors at all levels, the potential for best	85.07998657226562	459.2896728515625	12.017730712890625	439.3931579589844	78	Arial-ItalicMT
practice under the Open Method of Coordination is used.	85.0799560546875	473.08966064453125	12.017730712890625	301.598388671875	78	Arial-ItalicMT
These newly launched instruments can be financially more or less ignored.	85.08000183105469	500.6898193359375	12.0	439.36561584472656	79	ArialMT
Nevertheless, they are quality-oriented and they might thus entail long-lasting,	85.08001708984375	514.4898071289062	12.0	439.202392578125	79	ArialMT
wide-spread effects on the procedural side. It can be stated that the Polish MEPs	85.08001708984375	528.289794921875	12.0	439.30084228515625	79	ArialMT
were able to benefit from the vectors of opportunity based on the internal	85.08001708984375	542.0897827148438	12.0	439.32122802734375	79	ArialMT
philosophy of the European Parliament. Moreover, possessing of the necessary	85.08001708984375	555.8897705078125	12.0	439.35357666015625	79	ArialMT
political background, they were able to fulfil their role as transmitter of the	85.08001708984375	569.6897583007812	12.0	439.375244140625	79	ArialMT

The aim of this paper was to nuance the understanding of bargaining from the	85.08000183105469	652.4898071289062	12.0	439.3560333251953	81	ArialMT
perspective of newcomers. This paper has provided a preliminary mapping of	85.08001708984375	666.289794921875	12.0	439.2264404296875	81	ArialMT
negotiation tactics and strategies of actors of the EU-8. In presenting three case	85.08001708984375	680.08984375	12.0	439.4400634765625	81	ArialMT
studies it has become clear that there exists a potential for successful	85.08001708984375	693.8898315429688	12.0	439.33319091796875	81	ArialMT
negotiations, which yielded surprising results on the policy, politics and even polity	85.08000183105469	707.6898193359375	12.0	439.30079650878906	81	ArialMT
14 Mr Janowski was a mayor of Rrzeszów and a former Senator to represent Torún. Since the	85.08000183105469	736.2136840820312	11.927467346191406	439.36805725097656	82	Arial-ItalicMT
beginning of the 1990s he is interested in the regionalization of Poland and he is a founding	85.07708740234375	749.689453125	10.019996643066406	439.346923828125	82	ArialMT

level. Actors of the group of EU-8 could successfully use their outsider status and	85.08000183105469	72.9498291015625	12.0	439.4015655517578	84	ArialMT
the semi-optimal integration as an instrument to reinforce their negotiation	85.08000183105469	86.74981689453125	12.0	439.3848419189453	84	ArialMT
possibilities. The newcomers were thus able to positively “play the card of	85.08000183105469	100.5498046875	12.0	439.3488311767578	84	ArialMT

It remains an open question whether participants now better know how to cope	85.08000183105469	141.9498291015625	12.0	439.38233947753906	85	ArialMT

Reform Treaty as a future basis of conduct. Are actors of the EU-8 now fully	85.07998657226562	183.34979248046875	12.01776123046875	439.2950134277344	85	Arial-ItalicMT

addition, it remains to be seen, whether regional formations or clusterings such as	85.08001708984375	210.8897705078125	12.0	439.33074951171875	85	ArialMT
the Visegrád Group will pertain as new inner circles, based on smooth cooperation	85.08001708984375	224.68975830078125	12.01776123046875	439.31640625	85	Arial-ItalicMT

In a medium term perspective actors of the EU-8, which are socialized and	85.08000183105469	266.08984375	12.0	439.3606719970703	86	ArialMT
