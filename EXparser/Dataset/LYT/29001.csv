In the field of educational research, the dominant discourse is squarely focused	144.6999969482422	590.8796997070312	11.0	386.72718811035156	20	DAAAAA+ArialMT

This makes a great deal of sense since education is primarily concerned with	144.6999969482422	619.1796875	11.0	375.37501525878906	20	DAAAAA+ArialMT

involves tools (SÄLJÖ et al., 2006; WERTSCH, 1991). From this sociocultural	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	378.60902404785156	44	DAAAAA+ArialMT
perspective, tools are understood to mediate all human activity whether we notice	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	396.9021759033203	44	DAAAAA+ArialMT

of the way learning is conceptualized in this study as tool mediated activity. [10]	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	386.7470245361328	44	DAAAAA+ArialMT
While both activity theory and ANT are concerned with the mediation of systems	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	390.75306701660156	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
of activity, activity theory refers to systems of human activity mediated by tools	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	381.89820861816406	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
whereas ANT speaks to networks of humans and non-humans all mediating each	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	397.02333068847656	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
other's activity. From an ANT perspective, the properties of technologies in	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	364.1660614013672	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
learning situations cannot be ignored or considered transparent since both they	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	386.63917541503906	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
and the humans that use them mediate each other (LATOUR, 2007; LAW, 2002;	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	393.47023010253906	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2006). Instead, ANT focuses on the ways in which socio-	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	396.4512481689453	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
technical networks form as humans and non-humans interact and their practices	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	391.5012969970703	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT

objects themselves enacted by nested networks of humans and non-humans	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	374.8692169189453	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
(LAW, 2002; LAW & MOL, 2001). In the case of this study, for example, TI-Nspire	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	398.9152374267578	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
is treated as both a material object and a network-object. As a network-object it is	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	397.5291290283203	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
an element of classroom socio-technical networks that is enacted through nested	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	395.34022521972656	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
networks that include its developers, the teachers and students who use it,	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	363.66014099121094	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
electronics, software, and mathematical knowledge. Network-objects such as TI-	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	392.89808654785156	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
Nspire become what LATOUR (1990) refers to as "immutable" as the networks	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	383.90003967285156	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
that form them become stable. While network-objects stabilize in the context of	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	384.70301818847656	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
patterns of relations, the networks themselves remain fluid (LATOUR, 1990). In	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	386.3200225830078	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
this fluid space, the relations between network-objects constantly adapt as new	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	385.88026428222656	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
elements emerge or existing elements reconfigure but throughout this fluidity,	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	376.9700469970703	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
there is by necessity continuity. Otherwise, networks cease to remain intact, "If	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	382.8660430908203	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
everything is taken apart at the same time the result is rupture, the loss of shape-	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	396.23121643066406	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
continuity, the loss of identity. The result is more likely to be the creation of an	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	379.44508361816406	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT
alternative object" (LAW, 2002, p.99). In these cases, network-objects become	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	383.9221954345703	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT

dissolving into the car it holds together. Drawing on ANT conceptions of socio-	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	381.5460968017578	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT

understanding of cognition as tool mediated activity, in this study I examine	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	365.4199981689453	45	DAAAAA+ArialMT

part of their instructional practices. These teachers were chosen because they	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	381.79920959472656	49	DAAAAA+ArialMT

classrooms but have distinct teaching and technology use backgrounds. One	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	375.5841827392578	49	DAAAAA+ArialMT

teacher was new to teaching mathematics but had a background in computer	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	376.18922424316406	49	DAAAAA+ArialMT
programming and teaching technology. Choosing teachers with a high level of	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	379.7970733642578	49	DAAAAA+ArialMT
technical literacy afforded me access to contexts where the technology was	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	367.79615783691406	49	DAAAAA+ArialMT
embedded in many mathematics education practices but, by the same token,	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	375.4632110595703	49	DAAAAA+ArialMT
such levels of technical fluency are likely not present in most classrooms and this	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	395.56019592285156	49	DAAAAA+ArialMT

First, I conducted audio-recorded interviews using a semi-structured schedule	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	378.7960968017578	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
that focused on the teachers' use of TI-Nspire and their experiences with	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	354.4750518798828	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
technology in the classroom. I drew on the work of MISHLER (1986, 2004) and	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	384.59315490722656	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
WEISS (1995) to guide the interview process and strove for conversations that	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	383.09718322753906	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
were informal and flexible in nature. Following these initial interviews, I observed	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	391.14906311035156	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
a series of five sessions in a ninth grade class taught by each teacher. During the	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	397.3863067626953	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
five sessions in each class, I followed a complete teaching unit. In one class the	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	389.0150909423828	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
unit involved the teaching of the algebraic skills necessary to perform operations	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	391.4131622314453	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
such as simplification on binomial expressions. In the other class, the unit	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	358.17112731933594	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
focused on working with data to produce graphs and functions to model trends. I	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	391.8863067626953	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
chose to follow a complete teaching unit in each class so that I would have the	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	382.03016662597656	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
opportunity to observe both when TI-Nspire was used as well as when it wasn't. I	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	393.3710479736328	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
chose ninth grade classes because in this particular school, this was the grade	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	383.31715393066406	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
level at which students either purchased or were given a TI-Nspire handheld to	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	383.6031036376953	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
use rather than only having access to the technology during class time. This	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	370.7000274658203	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
situation offered me the interesting opportunity of observing students who were	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	385.3521270751953	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
relatively new to the technology and yet had unfettered access for developing	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	376.95924377441406	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
fluency with it. [13]	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	90.74699401855469	50	DAAAAA+ArialMT
While observing the classes, I recorded the activity with a video camera from the	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	392.89808654785156	51	DAAAAA+ArialMT
back corner of the classrooms. In general, I followed the teachers with the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	360.62403869628906	51	DAAAAA+ArialMT
camera since my intention for the classroom observations was to concentrate on	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	392.56825256347656	51	DAAAAA+ArialMT
the ways they included TI-Nspire in their instructional practices and situated the	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	386.68312072753906	51	DAAAAA+ArialMT
technology for their students. This focus on the teachers guided the majority of	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	383.51527404785156	51	DAAAAA+ArialMT
the in-camera editing decisions made about where to focus recording but I also	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	385.5061798095703	51	DAAAAA+ArialMT
made efforts to maintain a wide view as much as possible using panning and	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	374.70399475097656	51	DAAAAA+ArialMT
zooming sparingly. As DERRY et al. suggest, while a certain amount of pan and	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	390.1701202392578	51	DAAAAA+ArialMT
zoom may be needed to get a detailed view of activities of interest, "too much	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	377.6190948486328	51	DAAAAA+ArialMT

interaction analysis (JORDAN & HENDERSON, 1995). This approach shares	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	376.0348663330078	56	DAAAAA+ArialMT
many of the same or similar theoretical assumptions that are to be found in this	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	385.71522521972656	56	DAAAAA+ArialMT
study. In particular, the approach assumes "that knowledge and action are	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	362.45018005371094	56	DAAAAA+ArialMT

students were encouraged to use TI-Nspire to check answers before asking their	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	394.28419494628906	75	DAAAAA+ArialMT
teacher, they also tended to use the technology instead of the answer pages at	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	385.48426818847656	75	DAAAAA+ArialMT

about mathematical concepts and procedures. Speaking about the benefits of	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	378.90626525878906	79	DAAAAA+ArialMT
this practice during an interview, one teacher explained:	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	271.8650360107422	79	DAAAAA+ArialMT

more comfortably than the textbook. You need to fit yourself into the correct ways that	167.39999389648438	406.0361022949219	10.0	375.9896545410156	80	DAAAAA+ArialMT
the textbook proposes you do things and some kids just can't find it in themselves to	167.39999389648438	420.236083984375	10.0	369.7496643066406	80	DAAAAA+ArialMT
do that. So they can still be incorrect and playing around with their ideas and trying to	167.39999389648438	434.3360900878906	10.0	372.5397644042969	80	DAAAAA+ArialMT

instructional practice. Discussing a session in which students were given class	144.6999969482422	630.479736328125	11.0	381.5349884033203	91	DAAAAA+ArialMT

based on year of birth, the teacher spoke about how he had approached the	144.6999969482422	658.7797241210938	11.0	371.5142364501953	91	DAAAAA+ArialMT

"What I've done before is I would have given them an instruction sheet. It's a double-	167.39999389648438	702.0361328125	10.0	371.6495666503906	92	DAAAAA+ArialMT
sided sheet of paper. There's a graph of the men's data so they didn't actually plot the	167.39999389648438	716.1361083984375	10.0	376.1797180175781	92	DAAAAA+ArialMT
data or use the table of values. There was the graph, it asked them to draw the line of	167.39999389648438	730.3360595703125	10.0	375.6995544433594	92	DAAAAA+ArialMT

When assigning the activity before having access to TI-Nspire, the teacher used	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	390.9181671142578	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
to ask students to graph the male and female life expectancy data sets on paper	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	391.9082794189453	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
and then draw lines of best fit. Then he had students enter the data into older	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	376.58522033691406	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
graphing calculators that do not have all the features of TI-Nspire. With these	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	376.55213928222656	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
more basic calculators, the students then used linear regression to produce lines	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	393.2832794189453	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
of best fit. The students could then compare their drawn lines of best fit to those	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	389.2351837158203	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
produced by the calculators. Since class time was limited and the teacher's goal	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	389.5321807861328	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
was to have students explore the concept of modeling trends in data through	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	373.72523498535156	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
lines of best fit, he did not see the approach as ideal. Graphing the data on paper	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	396.2643585205078	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
took a long time but allowed students to interpret and draw their own lines of best	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	395.7032012939453	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
fit while using the older calculators for graphing took less time but did not afford	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	387.1891632080078	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
students the chance to create their own lines of best fit. TI-Nspire, however,	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	368.89601135253906	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
allows much of the manual work of data entry to be eliminated while still providing	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	397.03419494628906	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
students the opportunity to create their own graphs and lines of best fit using its	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	387.64015197753906	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
graphical functionality. By providing students with a digital document containing	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	385.94618225097656	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
all the necessary data and instructions, the teacher was able to make what he	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	379.7201690673828	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT

the activity on the interpretation of data. Particularly by reducing the time required	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	396.84718322753906	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT
for students to perform tasks, the relationship between student and TI-Nspire	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	375.49610900878906	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT

on mathematical concepts. In response to these possibilities, new patterns of	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	375.47413635253906	96	DAAAAA+ArialMT

and Tinkerplots™ at their disposal. As is the case in many schools, however, this	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.01617431640625	394.7521514892578	98	DAAAAA+ArialMT
software was hosted on computers in a lab that required classes to change	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	365.7061309814453	98	DAAAAA+ArialMT
classrooms. By contrast, TI-Nspire is a mobile handheld device that can be used	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	392.52418518066406	98	DAAAAA+ArialMT
in any classroom but has drawbacks particularly in terms of the limited size of its	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	391.3361358642578	98	DAAAAA+ArialMT
screen and keyboard. These factors meant that the teacher participants had to	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	383.4932403564453	98	DAAAAA+ArialMT
choose when to use TI-Nspire and when to use the computer lab. Discussing this	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	395.7801055908203	98	DAAAAA+ArialMT

lesson. During the observed classes, both teachers used TI-Nspire at times for	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	383.62513732910156	103	DAAAAA+ArialMT

writing on the blackboard and describing his actions, one teacher turned to TI-	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	380.75416564941406	103	DAAAAA+ArialMT

Beyond having the flexibility of a handheld device that can be easily transported	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	388.2781524658203	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
and used on an ad-hoc basis during a lesson, TI-Nspire was also seen by the	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	377.13502502441406	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
teachers as supporting richer mathematical conversation than traditional	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	351.95603942871094	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
computer labs. One teacher in particular indicated that part of his decision when	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	389.5321807861328	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
choosing TI-Nspire over taking his class to the computer lab was informed by the	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	394.74610900878906	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
idea that it's handheld nature lent itself to supporting or at least not hampering	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	380.4021759033203	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
conversation between students. He notes that, "The computer lab is a hideous	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	381.72218322753906	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT

about the handhelds" (teacher one). Despite the perceived beneficial attributes of	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0162353515625	395.99623107910156	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
TI-Nspire such as those the teacher refers to, many of its functions such as	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	367.09217834472656	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
dynamic geometry and graphing overlap with features of software often found in	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	390.0271759033203	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT

useful in some situations may render it clumsy and difficult to use in others. The	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	388.74024963378906	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
opinions and practices of the teachers show that a relationship exists between TI-	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	397.3643341064453	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
Nspire and the computer lab. While in many cases TI-Nspire was chosen over the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	398.9480743408203	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT
computer lab, it did not totally replace it and the socio-technical networks in the	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	384.58216857910156	104	DAAAAA+ArialMT

In the other classroom, an interactive whiteboard was often used in combination	144.6999969482422	550.4796752929688	11.0	389.27919006347656	111	DAAAAA+ArialMT
with TI-Nspire instead of the blackboard. It was the primary location of shared	144.6999969482422	564.6796875	11.0	378.01515197753906	111	DAAAAA+ArialMT
mathematical activity in this classroom and was integral to the way TI-Nspire was	144.6999969482422	578.7797241210938	11.000015258789062	394.9001007080078	111	DAAAAA+ArialMT
used. Describing his rationale for the arrangement, the teacher described, "It is	144.6999969482422	592.979736328125	11.0	384.9561309814453	111	DAAAAA+ArialMT
so important for them [the students] to be able to have access to it [the interactive	144.6999969482422	607.0797119140625	11.0	398.1232452392578	111	DAAAAA+ArialMT

two). By using an interactive whiteboard in combination with TI-Nspire, the	144.6999969482422	635.3796997070312	11.01617431640625	361.6879425048828	111	DAAAAA+ArialMT
teacher demonstrated ways of working and discussed activities that in his class	144.6999969482422	649.5797119140625	11.0	386.18800354003906	111	DAAAAA+ArialMT
were almost always assigned as self-contained digital documents. In addition,	144.6999969482422	663.6796875	11.0	378.6970977783203	111	DAAAAA+ArialMT
students could and often did come up to the front of the class and share ways	144.6999969482422	677.8796997070312	11.0	378.9281768798828	111	DAAAAA+ArialMT
they had approached problems or ways of working with TI-Nspire. For example,	144.6999969482422	691.979736328125	11.0	387.90406799316406	111	DAAAAA+ArialMT

I'm going to describe what she's doing.	259.6000061035156	125.93609619140625	10.0	170.81982421875	121	DAAAAA+ArialMT
All right so the very first thing is just to enter the formula and	259.6000061035156	271.83612060546875	10.0	264.0395202636719	122	DAAAAA+ArialMT
again it did simplify for us because six divided by three is two.	259.6000061035156	286.03607177734375	10.0	270.1296691894531	122	DAAAAA+ArialMT
So the next step [student] did was to divide by two and she's	259.6000061035156	418.43609619140625	10.0	264.6695861816406	123	DAAAAA+ArialMT
got 50 is equal to pi times r squared. [37]	259.6000061035156	432.6361083984375	10.0	179.76998901367188	123	DAAAAA+ArialMT
Thus, using the TI-Nspire projected on the interactive whiteboard, the student	144.6999969482422	462.97967529296875	11.0	377.3881378173828	124	DAAAAA+ArialMT

TI-Nspire tended to be the focus of student mathematical activity. [39]	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	339.94700622558594	128	DAAAAA+ArialMT
Each teacher had distinct impressions of how TI-Nspire and paper/pencil could	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	383.83412170410156	129	DAAAAA+ArialMT
be useful as parts of their instructional practices. As is the case with many of the	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	391.8311309814453	129	DAAAAA+ArialMT
pedagogical views teachers have, these intentions shaped the role the	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	343.2771453857422	129	DAAAAA+ArialMT
technology had in their classrooms (PIERCE, BALL & STACEY, 2009). During	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	381.2488555908203	129	DAAAAA+ArialMT
interviews one teacher in particular spoke often about resisting the technology	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	380.3471221923828	129	DAAAAA+ArialMT
becoming the focus during lessons. Discussing his choice not to find or create	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	380.2370147705078	129	DAAAAA+ArialMT
digital documents and distribute them to his students, he explained:	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	328.7130889892578	129	DAAAAA+ArialMT
"The documents I haven't used as much as I thought I would. And I don't think its	167.39999389648438	264.53607177734375	10.0	355.1095886230469	130	DAAAAA+ArialMT
because there aren't documents out there that are good. It's just that I don't want it to	167.39999389648438	278.736083984375	10.0	372.6595764160156	130	DAAAAA+ArialMT
be about the documents, the lessons or the handheld. You know I would prefer it to	167.39999389648438	292.83612060546875	10.0	364.9996032714844	130	DAAAAA+ArialMT
be in the background and the kids grab it when they need it" (teacher one). [40]	167.39999389648438	307.03607177734375	10.01470947265625	347.6700134277344	130	DAAAAA+ArialMT
This teacher believed strongly that TI-Nspire should be one of many tools	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	357.6980438232422	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
available to students but that most mathematical activity should be on	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	339.0310516357422	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
paper/pencil. Sharing the view of a number of mathematics education	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	338.67909240722656	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
researchers (DRIJVERS, 2000; PIMM, 1995; STACEY, 1997), that handing-off	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	383.28407287597656	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
procedural tasks to technology may actually make conceptualizing mathematical	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	391.75416564941406	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
concepts more difficult, the teacher also expressed concern about TI-Nspire	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	370.19410705566406	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
becoming a black-box. He described his fear of TI-Nspire becoming an opaque	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	385.0880889892578	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
computational machine into which problems go and solutions come out without	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	383.46009826660156	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
any indication of the processes that have been performed. This motivated him to	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	392.30421447753906	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
de-emphasize the importance of the technology in his classroom, instead	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	356.33409118652344	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
choosing to focus mathematical activity on paper/pencil. [41]	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	294.64698791503906	131	DAAAAA+ArialMT
The other teacher whose class was observed, had a distinctly different view and	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	389.7411651611328	132	DAAAAA+ArialMT
spoke most often about the advantages of TI-Nspire being the primary location of	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	396.3852081298828	132	DAAAAA+ArialMT
mathematical activity. Speaking during a debriefing session about a class in	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	369.4240264892578	132	DAAAAA+ArialMT
which he had asked students to create a number of graphs so that they could be	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	392.5023956298828	132	DAAAAA+ArialMT
compared, he offered:	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	108.20695495605469	132	DAAAAA+ArialMT
"I don't think I would have got that discussion necessarily about the different points of	167.39999389648438	590.0361328125	10.0	373.0096740722656	133	DAAAAA+ArialMT
intersection for the male and female [datasets] today if I didn't have the technology.	167.39999389648438	604.1361083984375	10.0	364.5595397949219	133	DAAAAA+ArialMT
Cause what would have happened is with, I don't know what did we have there 20	167.39999389648438	618.3360595703125	10.0	358.8696594238281	133	DAAAAA+ArialMT
data points, some of the kids it would take them half an hour to graph 20 data points.	167.39999389648438	632.4360961914062	10.0	372.1795959472656	133	DAAAAA+ArialMT
So by the time they get the one graph created and we get that line drawn that's	167.39999389648438	646.6361083984375	10.0	345.5895080566406	133	DAAAAA+ArialMT
almost the entire period right? So you can spend a period let's say creating graphs	167.39999389648438	660.736083984375	10.0	361.5896911621094	133	DAAAAA+ArialMT
but now if you want to get through the graphs and just do talking about it and	167.39999389648438	674.9360961914062	10.0	335.85955810546875	133	DAAAAA+ArialMT
analysing it and comparing it, it's so much easier to do in an instant have the graph	167.39999389648438	689.0361328125	10.0	363.4795227050781	133	DAAAAA+ArialMT

For this teacher, TI-Nspire made it possible to have more discussion and to	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	366.8610076904297	134	DAAAAA+ArialMT

advantages as outweighing concerns of black-box effects or the technology	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	367.9391632080078	134	DAAAAA+ArialMT

While the textbook was identified as a location of mathematical authority in the	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	382.5471954345703	146	DAAAAA+ArialMT
two observed classrooms, it also served as a location of mathematical tasks.	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	373.4170684814453	146	DAAAAA+ArialMT

different possibilities in terms of the kinds of tasks they could assign with the	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	372.3170928955078	146	DAAAAA+ArialMT

They assert that when a student undertakes a mathematical task with a computer	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	397.11134338378906	146	DAAAAA+ArialMT

technique they use from which mathematical theorizing emerges (DRIJVERS &	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	386.39686584472656	146	DAAAAA+ArialMT
KIERAN, 2006; see also KIERAN & SALDANA, 2005). This speaks to the	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	358.08290100097656	146	DAAAAA+ArialMT
interrelated nature of materials available to students and the kinds of tasks that	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	385.16517639160156	146	DAAAAA+ArialMT
can be assigned. Findings drawn from the two observed classrooms in this study	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	393.8001251220703	146	DAAAAA+ArialMT
support DRIJVERS and KIERAN's assertion by suggesting the introduction of TI-	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	394.3280792236328	146	DAAAAA+ArialMT
Nspire certainly influences the kinds of tasks assigned to students but, in	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	355.05812072753906	146	DAAAAA+ArialMT

Apart from being implicated as a medium for assigning tasks, the blackboard and	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	395.9562530517578	147	DAAAAA+ArialMT

classrooms. Together with the computer lab, paper/pencil and TI-Nspire	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	350.40501403808594	147	DAAAAA+ArialMT

individual and shared mathematical activity. While none of these locations	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	359.9089813232422	147	DAAAAA+ArialMT

with each configuration supporting different activity. As several researchers have	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	393.15113830566406	150	DAAAAA+ArialMT
suggested, in terms of learning perhaps what is most important is that multiple	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	381.4251251220703	150	DAAAAA+ArialMT
locations of mathematical activity were available for students to work and share	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	386.1660919189453	150	DAAAAA+ArialMT
with (DRIJVERS & KIERAN, 2006; KIERAN & SALDANA, 2005). [48]	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	336.8470001220703	150	DAAAAA+ArialMT
During the course of this study, I was particularly struck by the relationship	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	362.43907165527344	151	DAAAAA+ArialMT

whole class by means of a blackboard or interactive whiteboard. I found that the	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	389.59815979003906	151	DAAAAA+ArialMT
materials that participate in this relationship have a distinct role in mediating	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	368.8849639892578	151	DAAAAA+ArialMT
mathematical activity and that the interaction between students and materials in	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	388.05824279785156	151	DAAAAA+ArialMT
one location had a particular influence on the other and vice versa. In the case of	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0162353515625	394.88917541503906	151	DAAAAA+ArialMT
this study, the materials were most often paper and pencil and TI-Nspire for	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	368.3020782470703	151	DAAAAA+ArialMT
private activity, and blackboard and interactive whiteboard for public activity. The	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	392.57911682128906	151	DAAAAA+ArialMT
complexity of the relationships among these materials, students and teachers as	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	392.09523010253906	151	DAAAAA+ArialMT

more focused research with other materials and in other settings would help to	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	382.2281036376953	151	DAAAAA+ArialMT
further our understanding of this important aspect of classroom practice. [49]	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	374.14698791503906	151	DAAAAA+ArialMT
By taking an ANT approach that required me to attend to the interactions	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	355.05812072753906	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT

limit a priori judgments about their roles and agency and by working with both	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0162353515625	377.24818420410156	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT

indicate that socio-technical networks in classrooms using handheld technology	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	387.3651885986328	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
operate as a complex interconnected whole. From interactional analysis of the	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	380.63319396972656	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
video recordings of the two classrooms, it is particularly evident that the effects of	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	396.5391387939453	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
the teachers' decisions to include TI-Nspire as part of their instructional practices	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	393.6460723876953	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
were not limited to, for instance, the local patterns of relations between student	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	384.0762481689453	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
and technology while completing an activity. These interactions are instead	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	365.16700744628906	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
extremely broad, influencing practices as diverse as homework and the use of the	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	398.8052520751953	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
computer lab. The findings of this study show as DRIJVERS et al. (2010)	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	355.2890167236328	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
suggest, that the didactical configuration of technologies in mathematics	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	352.0659942626953	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
classrooms has a profound effect on the mathematical practices within them but	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	389.99415588378906	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
also suggest that this is far from a one-way phenomenon. While teachers have	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	384.1972198486328	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
enormous influence through their choices of what technological arrangements to	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	391.77613830566406	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
use, other agents both human and non-human in the classroom mediate these	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	383.1521759033203	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
configurations and are highly interrelated. For instance, the choice to assign	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	370.1060333251953	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
activities as digital documents rather than as questions from the textbook may	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	380.1382598876953	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
influence the decision to share mathematical activity as a class with an interactive	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	397.58412170410156	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT

work with paper/pencil. Each pattern of socio-technical relations mediates the	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	377.0911407470703	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
others and together they reciprocally shape the geography of the classroom. [50]	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	394.4469757080078	152	DAAAAA+ArialMT
