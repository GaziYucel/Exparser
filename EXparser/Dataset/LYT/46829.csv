Late 20th century can be described as a flourishing period of the democratic societies’ development. Before	72.02400207519531	130.73895263671875	12.0	468.12400817871094	13	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
World War II, only 28% of countries worldwide claimed to be democratic. By the end of 20th century,	72.02400207519531	144.53900146484375	12.0	468.14805603027344	13	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
particularly after the fall of the Berlin wall, this figure increased to 62%. Whether the process of the	72.02400207519531	158.3389892578125	12.0	467.98594665527344	13	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

According to William Damon (2001), the process of the democratization worldwide is not moving in	108.0199966430664	213.4189453125	12.0	432.01998138427734	13	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
the right direction in particular because of the civic and political disengagement of the young people.	72.02400207519531	227.218994140625	12.0	468.05198669433594	13	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

On the other hand, higher education is recognized as key to delivering the knowledge requirements	108.0199966430664	282.3289489746094	12.0	431.90608978271484	13	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

Hence, many researchers, with significant funding from foundations, have focused on the college	108.0199966430664	364.8889465332031	12.0	431.99593353271484	13	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

a generation that is both disconnected from conventional politics, and yet has much civic potential. There is	72.02400207519531	392.48895263671875	12.0	467.42417907714844	13	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

‘Democracy’ is one of the most used and arguable concepts in more recent history, particularly after the fall	72.02400207519531	354.0889587402344	12.0	467.5561981201172	23	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
of the Berlin Wall. Definitions and operationalization of this concept vary quite a bit. Hence, even though	72.02400207519531	367.8889465332031	12.0	467.7941131591797	23	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
there is no universally accepted definition, there are two approaches in defining democracy: ‘minimal’ and	72.02400207519531	381.5689392089844	12.0	467.77403259277344	23	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
‘maximal’. The first one focuses on the importance of ‘means’, that is, procedures such as fair elections,	72.02400207519531	395.36895751953125	12.0	467.5320281982422	23	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

democratic procedures but also ‘ends’, or outputs (such as economic equality and social services)	72.02400207519531	422.98895263671875	12.0	467.66429138183594	23	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

Democracy in political theory is described as a political philosophy, but also as a form of governing	108.0199966430664	450.46893310546875	12.0	431.5560531616211	23	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

(direct democracy) or intermediate manner (indirect democracy), i.e. according to the principle of	72.02400207519531	477.9489440917969	12.0	467.5802459716797	23	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

Hence, the notion of democracy is occasionally used in the context of liberal democracy, which on the other	72.02400207519531	519.3489379882812	12.0	468.2319793701172	23	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow

Different scholars define democracy in different ways. Definitions of democracy often are	108.0199966430664	103.25897216796875	12.0	431.95406341552734	28	ABCDEE+Arial Narrow
