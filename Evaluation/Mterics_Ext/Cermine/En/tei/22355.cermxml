        <p>This study investigated correlates of five time perspectives (TPs) and the Balanced Time Perspective (BTP) construct proposed by Zimbardo and colleagues. Two hundred and sixty Scottish participants completed the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI: Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), Subjective Happiness Scale (Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999) and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (Brown and Ryan, 2003). The most prevalent TP profile was moderate to high scores on all five TPs of the ZTPI. BTP participants were significantly happier and more mindful. Happiness and mindfulness were positively correlated but a future TP did not correlate with subjective happiness.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Time is not just a physical phenomenon but open to psychological interpretation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(James, 1890/1950)</xref>
        . Indeed,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">Suddendorf and Corballis (1997)</xref>
        noted that the
monitoring of time underpinned cognitive functioning. Thus learning to deal
with time, at both a subjective and objective level, is vital. Since time does not
exist independently of the person and is in fact a psychological construct, then it
is one that the person continually identifies with and refines
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Block, 1990)</xref>
        .
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Gonzalez and Zimbardo (1985)</xref>
        believed that the way in which we seek to
separate and apportion, or encircle chunks of time is a powerful and pervasive
characteristic of the human experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the interest in studying time has increased so too has the terminology
researchers use to describe its various facets. This hasn’t necessarily led to
confusion but some blurring of concepts and constructs related to the study of
time do exist
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref20 ref32 ref40">(Wallace and Rabin, 1960; Hoornaert, 1973; Hulbert and Lens,
1988; Nuttin, 1985)</xref>
        . Time attitude, time perspective, temporal orientation, and
time perception are often synonymous with each other and interchangeable
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Hulbert and Lens, 1988)</xref>
        . Other terms such as sense of time, subjective
experience and temporal experience all point to the notion that individuals are aware
of the passing of time and may crudely divide time into frames or periods. While
time attitude is the affective response (positive or negative) towards past,
present or future time frames
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Nuttin, 1985)</xref>
        time orientation is concerned with
determining which of these time frames an individual tends to favour
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(De
Volder, 1979)</xref>
        .
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">Nuttin (1985)</xref>
        defines time perception as judging the passage of
time itself but sees time perspective as a complex construct of four sub-factors,
namely extension, structuralization, and realism that can be applied to both past
and future perspectives
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(see Nuttin, 1985 for more detail on factors)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The present article does not disagree with these definitions but chooses to
focus on how Zimbardo and colleagues define and operationalize TP. That is
that TP is ‘the manner in which individuals, and cultures, partition the flow of
human experience into distinct temporal categories of past, present and future’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">(Zimbardo et al., 1997: 1008)</xref>
        . Zimbardo and colleagues also sought to
investigate these past, present and future time frames more thoroughly by developing a
scale to measure TP, namely the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI).
Here the past, present and future temporal frames are subdivided into five
subscales. These are, firstly, the Past Negative (PN) temporal frame. This reflects a
pessimistic attitude towards the past and possibly the experience of traumatic
life events. Secondly, the Past Positive (PP), which is marked by a more
sentimental and positive view of one’s past. Thirdly, Present Hedonistic (PH),
associated with the desire for spontaneous pleasure with slight regard to risk or
concern for future consequences. Then there is the Present Fatalistic (PF) frame
which is defined as a lack of hope for the future and belief that uncontrollable
forces determine one’s fate. The fifth and final dimension, the Future (F), is
characterized by reward dependence that occurs as a result of achieving specific
long-term goals.

      <p>
        Research thus far suggests that particular temporal frames have implications
for various aspects of wellbeing. For example, PN has been correlated with
depression, anxiety and low self-esteem, and it has been demonstrated that PN
individuals have fewer close friends
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref28 ref46">(Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999)</xref>
        , gamble more
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(Wassarman, 2002)</xref>
        and are more likely to be in alcohol and drug programmes
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Klingeman, 2001)</xref>
        than those in other TP groups. Findings from
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Lyubomirsky
and Nolen-Hoeksema (1995)</xref>
        and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow (1993)</xref>
        confirm
this. In contrast, high PP scores are related to high levels of self-esteem and
happiness
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref28 ref46">(Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999)</xref>
        , agreeableness and energy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref34 ref35">(Goldberg and
Maslach, 1996)</xref>
        and indicative of the use of social support networks

and Zimbardo, 1999, cited in Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999)</xref>
        . Present oriented (PH
and PF) individuals are less influenced by safe sex practices
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref34 ref35">(Rothspan and
Read, 1996)</xref>
        and tend to engage in risky driving

alcohol and drug misuse

        and suffer
chronic homelessness
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Epel et al., 1999)</xref>
        . However, moderate scores for the PH
factor, which have been positively correlated with novelty and sensation
seeking, can be beneficial for the individual provided they have some concept of
future consequences
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref28 ref46">(Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999)</xref>
        .

      <p>
        The Future sub-scale has been associated with less psychopathy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref28 ref39 ref46">(Wallace,
1956, cited in Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999)</xref>
        , and positively correlated with
participation in a cancer-screening programme
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Guarino et al., 1999)</xref>
        . It is therefore
regarded as the more constructive time perspective in terms of engaging in
positive health behaviours. According to Kazakina
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref28 ref46">(1999, cited in Zimbardo
and Boyd, 1999)</xref>
        , individuals with a more future-oriented outlook are more
optimistic and anticipate positive outcomes. This can, in itself, perpetuate more
positive functioning and can lead to higher levels of academic achievement
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref28 ref46">(Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999)</xref>
        , elevated levels of participation in research studies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Harber et al., 2003)</xref>
        , success in prison training programmes
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Chubick et al.,
1999)</xref>
        and more adaptive coping strategies for obtaining shelter when homeless
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Epel et al., 1999)</xref>
        . It has, however, been suggested that an overemphasis on
future goals compromises spontaneity resulting in poor ability to ‘switch off’
and enjoy the present
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref2 ref4 ref5">(Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2003)</xref>
        . Similarly an
overemphasis, or a temporal bias, towards a present orientation is associated with
negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety and depression
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">(Wills et al.,, 2001)</xref>
        ,
alcohol use, smoking and illegal drug use
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref43">(Keough et al., 1999; Wills et al.,
2001)</xref>
        and engaging in risky sexual practises
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref34 ref35">(Rothspan and Read, 1996)</xref>
        .
Despite some findings suggesting that a focus on the present is associated with
subjective wellbeing and general happiness
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref7">(Csikszentmihalyi, 1992; Keough,
et al., 1999)</xref>
        it seems that seeking immediate gratification, while disregarding
the consequences of actions, is typical of a predisposition to a present temporal
bias.
      </p>
      <p>
        To facilitate wellbeing
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Boniwell and Zimbardo (2004)</xref>
        propose that one
should strive to achieve what they call a Balanced Time Perspective (BTP). This
is characterized, statistically, as moderate to high scores for the PP, PH, and F
factors and relatively low scores for the PN and PF factors. It is operationally
defined as the ability to hold past present and future time perspectives
concurrently but importantly to be able to move between each perspective and to use
the most appropriate one in a given situation.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">Zimbardo and Boyd (1999)</xref>
        go as
far as to suggest that a BTP is central to optimal functioning. By that they mean
that the individual will reap psychological benefits if they are able to ‘work hard
when there is a mission to be accomplished, but play hard when the work is
done’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">(Zimbardo, 2002: 62)</xref>
        . By achieving a BTP an individual’s actions are
shaped by a consideration of all three temporal zones
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref18 ref2 ref24 ref28 ref3 ref4 ref46 ref5">(Zimbardo and Boyd,
1999; Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2003, 2004)</xref>
        as opposed to the limiting ability of
a dispositional bias towards one particular time frame. Accordingly,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Boniwell
and Zimbardo (2004)</xref>
        propose that individuals with a BTP will be happier than
those who do not have a BTP. However, most TP research has yet to establish
this. Most of the research has focused on specific temporal frames using varied
TP measurements rather than focusing on the BTP construct. For example,
Kazakina
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref28 ref46">(1999, cited in Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999)</xref>
        found positive correlations
between a present orientation and positive affect and between a past positive
orientation and life satisfaction. There is also evidence of positive relationships
between present orientation and general happiness
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Kammann and Flett, 1983)</xref>
        ,
life satisfaction
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Diener et al., 1985)</xref>
        and optimism
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(Lennings, 2000)</xref>
        . Similarily,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">Zaleski et al. (2001)</xref>
        showed that a future perspective was positively associated
with subjective wellbeing. However, a future orientation is positively correlated
with higher socio-economic status, which is only weakly related to wellbeing
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Diener, 2000)</xref>
        . Assessing subjective wellbeing has been done in many ways
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33 ref9">(e.g. Diener, 1997; Peterson, 2000)</xref>
        and there are numerous constructs that relate
to subjective wellbeing. For the purposes of the present study we chose to focus
on a global, subjective assessment of happiness. Thus the present study used the
Subjective Happiness Scale
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Lyubomirsky &amp; Lepper, 1999)</xref>
        . This simply asks
people to evaluate how happy or unhappy they are and does not involve
cognitive evaluations of the quality of, or satisfaction with, life
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(Lyubomirsky, 2001)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The notion that a BTP allows the individual to be more fully engaged in any
given situation corresponds with an aspect of consciousness called mindfulness.
Mindfulness, according to
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Hanh (1976)</xref>
        facilitates conscious awareness of the
reality of the present.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Brown and Ryan (2003)</xref>
        investigated mindfulness as an
individual differences attribute by adopting the Mindfulness Attention
Awareness Scale (MAAS). The study demonstrated significant positive
correlations between mindfulness and self-esteem, optimism, life satisfaction, and
wellbeing, and negative correlations with neuroticism, anxiety and depression.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Aims of the Present Study</title>
      <p>Thus the aims of the present study were first, to operationalize the five TPs of
the ZTPI and establish what relationship there is between these five temporal
frames and subjective happiness. It is important that the measurement of
happiness chosen for this study is asking for a simple judgement of how happy or
unhappy participants feel which is in contrast to other studies that have used
more global judgements of life satisfaction. Second, the BTP construct will also
be operationalized to establish what relationship, if any, having a BTP has with
subjective happiness scores. Third, to investigate to what extent mindfulness
relates to each of the TPs and the BTP construct. Since mindfulness is
synonymous with conscious absorption in the present then positive correlations
between particular TPs and the BTP should be evident. Thus the study will seek
to validate assumptions of the TP theory and the BTP construct as viewed by
Zimbardo and colleagues.</p>
      <p>
        On the basis of findings from previous research several hypotheses were
proposed. First, that those participants with a BTP profile would be more
mindful and happier than those not achieving a BTP profile (scores spread across
the other five temporal factors of the ZTPI). Second, that PP and F would be
positively correlated with mindfulness, while PN and PF orientations would be
negatively correlated with mindfulness. Further, given that high scores on the
PH scale are associated with risky activities and thrill seeking
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref3">(Boniwell and
Zimbardo, 2004)</xref>
        , which would be considered unmindful behaviour, it was
predicted that there would be a negative correlation between PH and
mindfulness. It was also hypothesized that PP, PH and F would be positively related
to subjective happiness, but that PN and PF would be negatively related to
happiness. Finally, based on
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Brown and Ryan’s (2003)</xref>
        findings it was predicted
that mindfulness and subjective happiness would be positively correlated.

    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Design</title>
      <p>A correlational questionnaire-based design was used. The dependent variables
were participants’ scores on the ZTPI, comprising five sub-scales; past negative
(PN), present hedonistic (PH), future (F), past positive (PP) and present
fatalistic (PF), the MAAS and subjective happiness scores.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>Participants</title>
      <p>Two hundred and sixty participants, 170 male and 90 female, ranging in age
from 16 to 83, completed the study. Participants were recruited via the adoption
of opportunity and snowball sampling methodology and consisted of students at
the Glasgow Caledonian University (UK), family, friends and associates of the
research team. The sample was thus drawn from a wider age range and living
circumstances than an exclusively university-based sample.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Materials</title>
      <p>The questionnaire consisted of demographic items ascertaining age and gender
and the following inventories.</p>
      <p>
        Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref28 ref46">(ZTPI: Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999)</xref>
        :
this is a 56-item self-report instrument, with five sub-scales as described
previously, which measures participants’ time-related attitudes and behaviour by
asking them to rate, on a Likert scale, how true each statement is of them (1 being
‘very untrue’ and 5 being’ very true). The scale was developed from case
studies, surveys and factor analysis and has shown reliability, validity and ease
of administration

        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref46">(SHS: Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999)</xref>
        : this is a
four-item self-report scale used to measure global subjective happiness. Two
items require participants to produce absolute measures of happiness with
regard to their own rating and that relative to peers. A further two questions ask
participants to rate to what extent descriptions of unhappy and happy people are
typical of them. All items are measured on a 7-point Likert scale and an average
score is taken across the four scores, with the fourth item being reverse-coded.
Higher scores reflect higher levels of subjective happiness.

        Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref4 ref5">(MAAS: Brown and Ryan, 2003)</xref>
        :
this is a 15-item scale that assesses individual differences in the frequency of
mindfulness states by asking participants to rate how frequently or infrequently
each experience happens to them. It also utilizes a Likert scale where 1
represents ‘almost always’ through to 6 which represents ‘almost never’.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>Procedure</title>
      <p>A pilot study ensured that the questionnaires were feasible and easy to follow.
The battery of questionnaires were then distributed using opportunity sampling
and snowballing techniques. Written instructions informed participants that it
would take approximately 10–15 minutes to complete. Participants were given a
14-day period within which to complete and return the battery of questionnaires
to a secure central point. Confidentiality was guaranteed. No payment or any
other incentive was offered.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Results pertaining to the number of participants holding a BTP profile will be
given first. These individuals were then tested against those with non-BTP
profiles (the other five temporal frames) in terms of subjective happiness and
mindfulness. A further analysis will concentrate on correlations between
subjective happiness, mindfulness and the five temporal frames themselves.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>How many participants achieved a BTP?</title>
      <p>To calculate this, low, moderate and high TP scores were obtained by dividing TP
scores for each of the five factors as close as possible to the 33rd and 66th
percentiles, resulting in three groups. Applying Zimbardo’s theory that low
scores on PN and PF, moderate to high on PP, F and PH constitute a BTP, we
could calculate that only 13 participants (10 females and 3 males) achieved a BTP.</p>

    <sec id="sec-11">
      <title>BTP and subjective happiness</title>
      <p>Table 1 shows means and standard deviations for SHS scores across two levels
of TP profile. Group 1 (n = 247) represents those participants who did not have
a BTP profile. Group 2 (n = 13) represents those who did. As can be seen from
Table 1 the group with a BTP profile scored significantly higher on the SHS than
those with other TP profiles (t = 5.04, df = 12, p = .0001). Thus the hypothesis
that happiness scores would differ significantly between those with a BTP
profile and those without was supported.</p>

      <title>BTP and mindfulness</title>
      <p>N
Table 1 also shows the means and standard deviations for MAAS scores across
the same two levels of TP profile as above. As can be seen from Table 1 the
group with the BTP profile did indeed score significantly higher on mindfulness
than those with other TP profiles (t = 2.63, df = 12, p = .011). Thus the
hypothesis that mindfulness scores would differ significantly between those with a
BTP profile and those without was supported.</p>

    <sec id="sec-13">
      <title>The five temporal frames and their relationship to subjective happiness</title>
      <p>The correlation matrix (Table 2, next page) shows there was no significant
relationship between the F and PF time perspectives and subjective happiness (F, r
= –.074; PF, r = –.0.97). However, PH and PP were significantly correlated with
happiness. For PH and PP, the relationship was positive (PH, r = .155, p &lt; 0.01;
PP, r = .214, p &lt; 0.001). The PN factor was negatively correlated with
happiness (r = –.416, p &lt; .001). As this result accounted for 17 per cent of
the variance, there was a relatively strong tendency for individuals with a
pessimistic view of the past to score low on the happiness scale.</p>

      <title>The five temporal frames and mindfulness</title>
      <p>The five temporal frames (PN, PH, F, PP and PF) were correlated with
mindfulness. Table 2 shows there were no significant correlations between F and
mindfulness (r = .027). However, PP, PN, PH and PF related significantly to
mindfulness. For PP, the relationship was positive (R = .125, p &lt; 0.5),
accounting for 2 per cent of the variance and indicating a weak tendency for those with
a high PP score to be more mindful. For PN, the relationship was negative (r =
–.492, p &lt; 0.001), accounting for 24 per cent of the variance, indicating that
those who score high in PN have a moderate tendency to be less mindful. For PF
and PH, the relationship was also negative (PF, r = –.23, p &lt; 0.001; PH, r =
–.116, p &lt; 0.05), accounting for 5 and 1 per cent of the variance respectively and
indicating that there is a weak tendency for those with high PF and PH scores to
be low in mindfulness.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study operationalized the five temporal frames of the ZTPI and
established what relationship there was between these and self-reported
subjective happiness. Moreover, the relationship between a BTP and subjective
happiness scores was investigated and compared to the five non-BTP temporal frames
or time perspectives. In addition, the extent to which mindfulness related to each
of the temporal frames and the BTP construct was clarified. It was proposed that
individuals with a BTP would be happier and more mindful than those with
other profiles. The results did indeed show that 13 individuals matched the
* Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (1-tailed).
** Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (1-tailed).
*** Correlation is significant at the 0.0001 level (1-tailed).
criteria for a BTP. Analysis of the BTP group compared to those with other
profiles showed that those with a BTP had significantly higher mean scores for
subjective happiness and mindfulness than individuals with other TP profiles.
However, this study found that the most prevalent temporal frame profile
constituted individuals with moderate to high scores in all five of the frames
(n = 43). These individuals set themselves apart from the BTP group by having
moderate to high scores in the risk factors of past negative and present fatalistic.</p>
      <p>An analysis of the five temporal frames in relation to happiness and
mindfulness was also carried out. It was hypothesized that the PH- and PP-subjective
happiness relationship would be positive and that the PN-subjective happiness
correlation be negative. These hypotheses were indeed confirmed and allow us
to state that the happier participants were those more likely to hold positive as
opposed to negative attitudes towards their past, be more spontaneous and live
more in the moment.</p>
      <p>
        Rather surprisingly the F factor was not significantly correlated with
subjective happiness. A future orientation is apparently linked to positive functioning
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Kazakina, 1999)</xref>
        , participation in health screening
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Guarino et al., 1999)</xref>
        and
less psychopathy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">(Wallace, 1956)</xref>
        . It follows then that this would link to
higher levels of subjective happiness. However, it has to be acknowledged that
there is some degree of ambiguity in research findings between time
perspectives and wellbeing. Despite the links with higher optimism
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref28 ref46">(Zimbardo and
Ryan, 1999)</xref>
        , self-efficacy, and more adaptive coping strategies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Epel et al.,
1999)</xref>
        one should temper these findings by bearing in mind that
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">Boniwell and
Zimbardo (2003)</xref>
        have suggested that an emphasis on achieving future goals
may compromise the level of enjoyment in present activities and the importance
of family values at the root of our own past. The present authors propose that an
emphasis on future goals not only pulls people away from absorption in present
reality but could also create more anxiety and hurriedness. It is also the case that
one should take into account how future-oriented people would feel if goals and
plans are thwarted by current obstacles. Further investigations of the
phenomenology of the future orientation is warranted.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was expected that the PF sub-scale would be negatively correlated with
subjective happiness. It is not surprising that this aspect has been supported
since PF is said to be the most destructive factor as it has been associated with
higher levels of aggression, anxiety and depression
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref28 ref46">(Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999)</xref>
        .
A fatalistic frame of the present does not however preclude concern for future
consequences. For example, in relation to health-promoting behaviour
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Hamilton
et al. (2003)</xref>
        found that a present orientation was not negatively correlated to
such behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>It is our belief that this is the first study to test mindfulness in relation to time
perspective. It was hypothesized that if mindfulness represents awareness and
the keeping of conscious thoughts in the present then one would expect that
those high on mindfulness are first, happier and second, possess particular time
perspectives relevant to the mindfulness state. It may be that these people,
thanks to the mindfulness state, possess more ability to balance work, leisure
and family demands and may be more likely to possess a BTP profile. Thus it
was hypothesized that mindfulness scores would differ significantly across
those with a BTP profile and those without. Indeed the results showed that the
BTP group participants did score significantly higher on mindfulness than those
with other TP profiles. As predicted, certain temporal frames were related to
MAAS scores. As predicted the PP-MAAS correlation was positive, while the
PN-, PH- and PF-MAAS relationships were negative. However, the association
between the future temporal frame and MAAS scores though positive was not
significant. Overall we can say that those who were more mindful tended to have
a more favourable perception of the past and towards life in general. Examining
relationships between the ZTPI and MAAS and finding that PP-MAAS
correlations were in the predicted direction offers some validation for PP factor of the
ZTPI itself.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-16">
      <title>Limitations and Future Considerations</title>
      <p>
        It has to be acknowledged that the correlational nature of the research design
precludes even the slightest speculation on causal connections or underlying
mechanisms between a BTP, the other temporal frames, and wellbeing.
However, the fact that those with a BTP showed higher levels of aspects of
wellbeing supports basic tenets of the BTP construct. This study, we believe, is the
first to attempt a BTP profile analysis and as such presents evidence in support
of the
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">Zimbardo and Boyd’s (1999)</xref>
        BTP theory. However, these findings should
be regarded as preliminary. A replication study seeking to capture more
individuals with a BTP profile would be a prudent next step. Since ethics stipulated
that anonymity be afforded each participant in the present study, in depth
interviews with those with a BTP were not possible. We therefore suggest that future
studies consider case study analyses of those found to have a BTP. This would
allow extension of the theory and operationalization of it within a practical
setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PP–subjective happiness correlation was the highest positive result of all
the time perspectives and subjective happiness scores. These findings are in line
with previous research on the happiness and time perspective
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref22 ref26 ref3">(Kammann and
Flett, 1983; Lennings, 2000; Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2004)</xref>
        . That a positive
relationship was found is accepted but it is only a relationship and in no way
constitutes a causal explanation nor indicates underlying mechanisms. In addition
the present study did not take into account participants’ past positive and/or
negative life events. Thus we have no understanding of context that may have
contributed to decisions made by participants when they were completing the
questionnaires. Future research should attempt to ascertain exposure to
past negative and positive life events as mediators. Better still would be an
appreciation of coping mechanisms in those with a PP profile alongside a personality
measure. Individual difference data such as this can inform theory and possibly
interventions aimed at altering temporal frames to maximise positive functioning
and wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to point out that results here could be influenced by the
measurement of happiness chosen. Equivocal results may be produced because
different surveys adopt different interpretations of the subjective wellbeing
construct. The adoption of the SHS scale in this study was a deliberate attempt
to use a global measure that measured simply how happy or unhappy people
perceived themselves to be. Since measures of wellbeing assess either cognitive
or the emotional components of the construct, the present authors argue that
simplification was needed here. Notwithstanding this, it would be interesting to
probe the emotional components with respect to time perspective more
purposefully. For example, studies could perhaps use such measures as the Positive and
Negative Affect Scale
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(PANAS: Watson et al., 1988)</xref>
        and/or adopt the Emotion
Diary
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref3 ref30">(Oatley and Duncan, 1994; Duncan and Grazzani-Gavazzi, 2004)</xref>
        or
Experience Sampling Methodologies. Such strategies would place scores on
time perspective scales in context. These would be most appropriate in a study
that aimed to investigate possible changes in the five factors across time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extent to which these results are generalizable must be treated with
caution even though steps were taken to widen recruitment beyond the student
population and to use a wide age range. We did not feel that there were sufficient
numbers in particular age categories to be able to take a look at developmental
changes in time perspectives. This would be an important next step for future
research. Some consideration should also be given to the cultural context within
which this investigation took place. In this Scottish sample it was found that a
substantial number presented scores that indicated the predominance of past
negative and present fatalistic outlooks. The intriguing question is whether this
is serendipitous or a part of the character of Scottish culture? Indeed, to what
extent other cultures either share this profile or have their own unique profile is
worthy of investigation. Since some research has indicated cultural variation
with regards to time and time perspective
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref35 ref36 ref4 ref5">(Spangler and Petrovich, 1978; Sagie
et al., 1996; Brislan and Kim, 2003)</xref>
        we may have to accept that results here may
not be generalizable. However, research on time perspective itself is not yet
extensive enough to begin to suggest that certain individuals and/or cultures
‘own’ a particular global temporal bias.
      </p>
      <p>This research offers preliminary data on the BTP profile and the five
temporal frames of the ZTPI. There is much yet that can be done to elucidate the BTP
profile itself and whether a temporal bias that compromises wellbeing would be
amenable to change, given appropriate interventions. Perhaps interventions that
facilitate the reflective, self-awareness skills inherent in mindfulness are a first
step in this process.</p>
