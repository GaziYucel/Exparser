        <p>»Immer noch begeistert: Die unveränderte Europäizität der spanischen parlamentarischen Elite während der Eurozonen-Krise«. Since the adhesion of Spain to the EEC in 1986, the Spanish electorate has shown a high level of support for the European integration process. Even more enthusiastic than their fellow citizens, Spanish political elites also expressed a strong commitment to the European integration project, based in a pro-EU consensus beyond party and ideological divides. However, Spain has also been one of the countries most affected by the economic and financial crisis that has hit the EU (particularly the Eurozone) since 2010. The main questions we aim to answer in this paper is whether this crisis and its management by EU institutions has eroded the traditional support for the EU shown by Spanish domestic political elites and, if so, to what extent. To this end, we draw on survey data provided by the InTune and ENEC-2014 projects on the attitudes of Spanish MPs towards the EU in the years 2007, 2009, and 2014. Results show that the traditional pro-EU stance of Spanish MPs has remained mostly stable during the crisis, yet such stability has increased the representation gap with citizens in this area.</p>

        Introduction1
The financial crisis started in 2008 has produced enormous consequences in the
political life of the Southern European democracies. Scholars have detected
erosion of citizens’ support to political institutions and the main political actors,
particularly, mainstream political parties
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref22 ref24 ref29 ref35 ref37 ref8">(Mair 2013; Cordero and Simón 2015;
Teixeira et al. 2016)</xref>
        . As a consequence, an ‘electoral epidemic’ has profoundly
altered party systems, damaging the social basis of traditional political parties and
pushing new challenger actors to parliaments and governments at different levels
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref12 ref16 ref21 ref23 ref29 ref30 ref37 ref5 ref6 ref9">(Bosco and Verney 2012; Hernández and Kriesi 2016)</xref>
        . Spain has been one
outstanding example of this transformation, which has brought new parties like
Podemos or Ciudadanos to the political landscape
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref24 ref27 ref28 ref29 ref30 ref35 ref8">(Rodríguez-Teruel and Barrio,
2015; Rodriguez-Teruel et al. 2016)</xref>
        . These changes have affected not only
national institutions but also the traditional support to the European Union (EU),
which in turn has fostered the raise of populist forces that question the role of
states in the European integration. Hence, an increase of critical attitudes of the
national political elites towards the EU in these countries could be spreading
among voters, and damaging indeed the traditional elite consensus on Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This article aims to analyse the consequences of this political turbulence on
the Europeanness of the Spanish parliamentary elite. Spain has been traditionally
one of the more pro-European countries even before its accession to the European
Economic Community (EEC) in 1986
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(Sanchez-Cuenca 2001; Szmolka 2007)</xref>
        .
This consistency of political attitudes towards Europe has been particularly strong
among domestic elites, beyond party and ideological divides
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref19 ref20">(Jerez et al. 2010;
Jerez et al. 2015a)</xref>
        . However, Spain has also been one of the countries that has
most dramatically experienced the consequences of both the economic and
financial debt crisis since 2008. This has been accompanied by a deterioration of the
support to the EU amongst the population. Previous works have suggested that
this did not occur with the national political elite in the beginning of the crisis
period
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref24 ref29 ref35 ref8">(Sojka et al. 2015; Freire and Moury 2015)</xref>
        . This article’s main question is
whether things have changed with the subsequent deepening of the economic
crisis. To check the evolution of the attitudes of Spanish political elites towards
the EU, we will examine survey data collected at three different time points:
2007, 2009 and 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our main expectation is that continuity might prevail over change during the
observed period, in line with the continuity that has also characterised
composition of the parliamentary elite
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Jerez et al. 2016)</xref>

pro-EU consensus shared by the main political parties (the Popular Party, PP, and
the Socialist Party, PSOE), the absence of relevant party system changes in the
period we cover would contribute to keep the elite attitudes towards the EU under
stable patterns. Despite the impact of the Eurozone crisis, until 2015 the main
features of the Spanish party system were very stable. Although the 2011 general
election produced a serious collapse of the PSOE vote (which led this party to
lose the government to the PP), the concentration of the electoral vote and the
parliamentary representation amongst mainstream parties did not change
significantly, and those parties with soft Eurosceptic attitudes
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(Ruiz-Jiménez and Egea
de Haro 2011)</xref>
        remained a small minority in the national chamber. Consequently,
we expect to find a stable pattern in the main Europeanness traits of the Spanish
parliamentary elite, while potential changes in attitudes and opinions could obey
to party variance rather to elite transformation. In this respect, the article assesses
to what extent this elite consensus concerning the EU is affected by inter-party
divisions existing due to the politicization of EU issues at the national level.
Besides, since these mainstream positions regarding the EU within the elite
contrast with the change in citizens’ attitudes, a resulting scenario would be an
increase in the gap between elite’s opinions and those of the general population,
eroding the traditional elite-mass congruence in Spain regarding the EU.
      </p>
      <p>The rest of this article is structured as follows. The second section reviews the
main political facts that have shaped the political life in Spain in the last decade,
paying particular attention to the main issues related to the EU. Then, the third
section introduces the main concepts, expectations and the data employed in this
research. Section four analyses the political attitudes regarding the EU in the
parliamentary elite. And finally, the concluding section summarize the main
findings and connects patterns observed in the previous section with the changes
in the Spanish political system occurred since 2014.

        <title>A Turbulent Political Time in Spain</title>
        <p>Although the time span strictly covered by the data used in this paper
(20072014) may look too short to expect relevant changes, the Spanish political and
economic landscape experienced deep transformations. During this period,
there were three different parliamentary terms with episodes of government
change, economic instability and social turbulence. Along this time, the
references to the EU in the Spanish political debate have evolved from the optimism
during the referendum for the Constitutional treaty in 2005 to the controversy
in 2012-13 about the policy conditions linked to the bailout of the Spanish
financial system through the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
        <p>The first government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero (2004-2008) was
characterised by a period of strong economic development, in which Spain
returned to its traditional support to Germany and France as leading actors in</p>
        <p>HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 216
the EU, abandoning the transatlantic-oriented policy implemented by the
previous prime minister, José Maria Aznar (Delgado et al. 2015). In this respect,
Zapatero gave strong relevance to the Spanish role in the process of ratification
of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. While in other countries
the Constitutional Treaty raised eurocriticism and division within the elite, in
Spain the vote was employed as a legitimacy device for the national
government. Indeed, Spain was one of the few countries in consulting citizens through
a referendum before the parliament ratified the document. Despite the clear
victory of those supporting the project2, a low level of public debate about the
text (with a resulting low turnout), and an image of consensus and
complacen3
cy amongst political elites weakened the political outcome of the referendum .</p>
        <p>
          The good results in terms of economic growth and unemployment lead the
Spanish GDP per capita to surpass Italy by the end of 2007, and fostered good
prospects to reduce distance between Spain and the main economies of the EU,
Germany and France. In this context, the positions of soft Eurocriticism in the
Spanish political elite were mainly related to two concerns
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(Ruiz-Jiménez and
Egea de Haro 2011, 117)</xref>
          . On the one hand, there was the criticism from small
radical left parties regarding the lack of attention, from their point of view, to
social matters in the EU. On the other hand, nationalist parties in Catalonia and
the Basque country remained sceptical about the weak role of regional
representation in the EU institutional framework. By 2007, the Spanish citizens
showed the lowest levels of support to the idea that the Spain had not benefitted
from belonging to the EU since the access to the CEE in 1986
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(Ruiz-Jiménez
and Egea de Haro 2011, 122)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>The context changed dramatically during Zapatero’s second term
(20082011). The burst of the US real-state bubble in autumn 2008, following the
collapse of Lehman Brothers, had a tremendous effect on the internal situation
of Spain and its own housing bubble. However, contrary to other European
countries, the Spanish government adopted a moderate approach against the
crisis, with discretionary counter-cyclical fiscal policies and a Keynesian
strategy (increasing the budget deficit to 11.1% of GDP at the end of 2009), while it
was reluctant to implement serious structural reforms. This helped to maintain
the public’s confidence in a quick exit from the crisis. But the deterioration of
the situation in Greece eventually forced the EU to intervene in order to hinder
the spread of the risk of default to other Southern European countries. Hence,
in May 2010 Zapatero announced a U-turn change in its policy agenda, with

constitutional project was backed by 76,7% of the participants. Some weeks later the
Congreso de los Diputados (the lower house of the parliament) approved the text by 311 votes
against 10 (0 abstention) as well as the majority of the high chamber did (225 to six votes,
and one abstention).</p>

emergency cuts and structural reforms aimed at containing the public deficit
and avoiding the risk of bailout. In August 2011, PSOE and PP approved an
amendment to the Spanish Constitution (article 135) introducing a cap on the
structural deficit of the state.</p>
      <p>
        While support for the PSOE’s in the opinion polls shrank following this
Uturn in the government’s policies, the new agenda altered the role of the EU in
the Spanish public debate. The EU institutions started to be identified as the
promoters of the austerity policy implemented by the government, being also
blamed as responsible for the consequences that arouse in the following
months. Hence, some relevant intellectuals argued in favour of leaving the
euro4, while support for democracy and to the main political institutions
declined in parallel to what was happening in Southern European countries
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Alonso 2013)</xref>
        . Political dissatisfaction also fostered social mobilization against
the government and the political class, like the massive demonstrations across
Spain held in May 15th 2011, dubbed the 15-M movement, also known as the
indignados
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Fominaya 2015)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The collapse of the support for the government in the 2011 general election
gave the victory to the PP and paved the way for a majority government headed
by Mariano Rajoy. Despite the PSOE’s electoral setback, the two main parties
achieved 73% of the total vote. The new executive did not alter the agenda of
structural reforms, facing also major pressures from the EU to call for a bailout,
after the downgrade of several Spanish banks’ credit ratings. Indeed, the
housing bubble crisis was evolved to a financial crisis in the banking system,
particularly in the local and regional semipublic saving banks (cajas de ahorro).
Finally, the PP government accepted a bailout deal from the EU to the banking
system under the form of a loan to recapitalize Spain’s weakest banks
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref25">(De
Guindos, 2016)</xref>
        . In exchange, the government implemented new reforms and
accepted European monitoring of Spanish banking reform. However, the state
of the economy still experienced strong pressures during Rajoy’s first terms.
Thus, public debt evolved from 69,5% (2011) to 99,3% of the GDP (2014),
public deficit increased to -10,4% (2012), although budget cuts helped to
reduce it to -5.9% (2014). In turn, unemployment peaked in 2013 to almost five
million people, while the youth unemployment rate reached 56% by that time,
although since 2014 it started to decrease slightly5.

        ). In 2012 and 2013 several surveys detected a
dramatic collapse of the support for the two main Spanish parties, while the
existing small parties did not really benefited from this

In this context, the European election in May 2014 triggered an unprecedented
electoral dealignment, with the appearance of new parties like Podemos and
Ciudadanos on the EP, while the two main parties did not achieved even a 50%
of the total vote. The electoral change came mainly from young, urban,
politically-informed voters

          <p>
            The financial crisis and its political consequences altered the position of Spain
in the EU, as we have argued in the previous section. It changed from a story of
economic success to a potential bailout, even though it would be ‘too big to
fail’. This turn could not happen without affecting citizens’ perceptions of the
political system and its legitimacy, although this negative effect should not
necessarily be immediate
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref24 ref29 ref35 ref8">(Freire and Moury 2015, 179)</xref>
            . Some figures show
that trust in government and its ability to manage the crisis steadily declined as
the crisis hit the Spanish economy, in a more consistent way than in other
European countries (Roth 2009, 22). According to previous studies, the way
citizens perceive their national governments and institutions influences strongly
their views and support for the EU
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Anderson and Reichert 1995;
SánchezCuenca 2000)</xref>
            . From a utilitarian perspective, this support is also explained by
citizens’ perceptions of welfare gains from integration policies
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref34">(Gabel 1998;
Scharpf 1999)</xref>
            . Hence, a regression in policy outcomes and the subsequent
deterioration of the perception of national institutions might erode the support
for the EU amongst citizens.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, these symptoms might not be necessarily appear among the
political elite. Parliamentarians’ attitudes and perceptions are elaborated and sustained
upon stronger cognitive support, since they are better informed about European
issues and have a strongest attachment to the EU
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref24 ref29 ref35 ref8">(Müller et al. 2012; Sojka et al.
2015; Freire and Moury 2015)</xref>
            . Indeed, as political representatives know better
the limits in the EU’s room for manoeuvre, their expectations about the EU role
are more in line with reality. In countries like Spain, where the potential for
unilateral action is weaker, it might be even the case that such context of crisis could
          </p>
          <p>
            HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 219
foster support for more integration, as the political elites might perceive that
overcoming the current situation or avoiding new crisis in the future requires a
supranational solution. Alternatively, an opposite evolution is also possible, since
politicians could adopt more critic positions towards the EU in response to an
increase of Euroscepticism among voters
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Hooghe and Marks 2009)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            The main theoretical expectation in this article is that the attitudes of
Spanish MPs towards the EU have not significantly changed during the crisis. This
hypothesis is in line with the above mentioned arguments about elites’ higher
cognitive competence and the political stability in parliament during the
observed period. Therefore, between 2004 and 2014, despite of the electoral
changes mentioned in the previous section, the two main parties, both
traditionally pro-EU, accounted for more than 80% of the seats at the lower house.6
Yet this does not mean the disappearance of ideological and party differences.
In fact, some studies
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(Ruiz Jiménez and Egea de Haro 2011; Vázquez et al.
2014)</xref>
            have found differences in the pro-EU positions of PSOE and PP. For
instance, the PSOE has traditionally shown a more federalist stance, while the
PP has supported a view centred on the coincidence between EU and national
interests. Hence, a second theoretical expectation is stable interparty divisions
along ideological divides in both main parties, even though we do not expect
that these party differences respond to a high politicization of EU issues at the
national level. Consequently, they should not alter the general pattern of strong
Europeanness amongst Spanish elites.

            Our analysis focuses on the patterns of ‘Europeanness’ is defined here as a
“composite set of perceptions and sentiments” that drives political elites
decisions and behaviours in the European integration

Verzichelli 2012, 8)</xref>
            . In this sense, the concept departs from more generic uses in cultural
and identity studies, and captures several aspects of attitudes and preferences
towards European integration. Following those authors, Europeanness becomes
a multidimensional concept including the emotive, cognitive-evaluative, and
projective-conative dimensions (ibid. 8). The emotive dimension refers to
feelings of attachment and thus towards the European integration. The
cognitive-evaluative dimension includes attitudes dealing with the working of the
EU and its scope of governance. Finally, the projective-conative dimension is
based on the prospects and preferences for higher levels of European
unification and integration in the future.

        <title>Data</title>
        <p>
          The empirical basis for our analysis comes from the data gathered by the two
waves of the elite survey of the IntUne project
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(2007 and 2009)</xref>
          and the recent
ENEC survey (2014) conducted amongst national parliamentarians from
several European countries. This allows us to develop a comparative analysis across
three parliamentary terms in Spain, covering the different periods described in
the historical section. The content of the IntUne 2007 and 2009 elite surveys in
Spain was presented and analysed in previous works
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref18 ref19 ref20 ref24 ref25 ref29 ref35 ref6 ref8">(Jerez, Real-Dato and
Vázquez 2010, 2015a)</xref>
          . Regarding the 2014 ENEC survey, it basically repeated
the structure and questions of the IntUne elite surveys, with some additional
questions aimed at grasping the mood of national political representatives
during the crisis. The sample consisted of 81 MPs, following the research design
of the project (see Table 1). The fieldwork was implemented between October
21st 2014 and February 18th 2015 – though almost all but three interviews
were conducted before the end of 2014. Most of the interviews were
face-toface (76.5%), while the rest were conducted by telephone. In this article, the
sample is weighted by three criteria: parliamentary group, gender and past

parliamentary experience (Table 1). The deviation rate respect to the designed
sample is 1.4% for party, 4.2% for sex (with a slight underrepresentation of
female MPs), and 0.5% for experience.
        </p>
        <p>Data collection took place two years after the formation of the PP
government with a strong parliamentarian majority. In this respect, the 2014 ENEC
dataset differs from the two previous IntUne wages, conducted under PSOE
governments. The party composition is indeed the main difference between
both datasets. Our analysis controls for this factor when it comes to interpret
significant differences across time, by distinguishing between PSOE and PP
parliamentarians, or between left and right parties.

        <title>The Emotive Dimension: Attitudes of Support to the EU</title>
        <p>Most aspects dealing with the emotive dimension of Spanish parliamentarians’
Europeanness does not show major changes during the period 2007-2014
(Figure 1). This general stability confirms the high level of support for European
integration among Spanish MPs. Only the level of trust in the European
Parliament (EP) has experienced a statistically significant increase from 6.3 in
2007 to 7.0 in 2014, while in the case of the European Commission (EC) and
the Council of the EU levels of trust remain approximately the same along the
observed period. No changes are also observed in the differences between
parties except in 2014, where a significant difference appear in the levels of
trust among socialist MPs and those of the PP (6.1 against 7.4 points).</p>
        <p>
          The general positive stance is also observable in the indicator of attachment
to the EU. Despite having significantly stronger attachment to the nation and to
the region
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(Sojka et al. 2015)</xref>
          , Spanish representatives are amongst those with
highest levels of attachment to the EU (nine out of ten MPs consider
themselves somewhat or very attached). There has been a steady (but not
significant) increase of four points between 2007 and 2014, mainly because of the
evolution of those declaring being ‘very attached’ (ten points of differences),
including the 53.1% of the whole group. Therefore, the hard times experienced
by the Southern European countries and the controversy with the EU austerity

policies do not seems to have eroded the emotive linkage between the Spanish
elite and the idea of Europe. Yet, the strongest expression towards Europe is
larger amongst the PSOE parliamentarians (61.5% are very attached) compared
to the PP (45%).</p>
        <p>
          In turn, the perception that the country has benefit from EU membership has
remained mainly unaltered along time (Figure 1), being the percentage higher
than that for the level of attachment to the EU. This is congruent with the
public opinion view, and confirms Spain as a country in which Europeanness
seems clearly rooted on the positive assessment of EU membership. These data
support the utilitarian explanation of attitudes towards the EU, explained
mainly by the positive outcomes member states and their populations have
experienced from EU membership
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Aspinwall 2007)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>However, these signs of strong support to the European integration coincide
with a moderate expression of criticism towards the democratic functioning of
EU institutions. Thus, almost 40% of the Spanish MPs declare in 2014 to be
somewhat or very dissatisfied with the democracy in the EU. In this respect,
the extent of democratic dissatisfaction is mostly explained by party affiliation,
as 57.6% of the PSOE MPs declares a negative assessment regarding the issue
(figures are similar for the other minor political parties), while 87.5 of the PP
representatives express the opposite view. Moreover, as Figure 2 shows,
dissat</p>
        <p>HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 223
isfaction with the democratic working of the EU has worsened compared to the
initial years of the crisis. The group of individuals declaring in 2014 to be very
dissatisfied with democracy in the EU decreased by 11 points with respect to
2009. Changes were significant both for the PP and the PSOE, though they run
in different directions (satisfied MPs increase in the PP and decrease in the
PSOE). Therefore, this deterioration of the views of the democratic working of
EU institutions among Spanish MPs belonging to opposition parties, expresses
a deeper insatisfaction with the balance of power within the EU, which during
the crisis has clearly turned to favour creditor countries. This is confirmed by
the significant increase in 2014 of the percentage of respondents who agreed
with the idea that EU decisions did not take into account the interests of Spain
(27.2% in 2009, 50% in 2014) (see below).</p>
        <p>
          However, these criticisms have not influenced the high levels of support for EU
integration among Spanish MPs. Figure 3 confirms this assertion, since the
distribution of opinions concerning whether the EU integration process should
be strengthened or stopped, and the corresponding average scores
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref39 ref8">(8.1 in 2007
and 2009, 8.0 in 2014)</xref>
          , have hardly changed during the crisis. Party identity
makes again a distinction here when explaining the distribution of opinions
(average differences are not statistically significant): while 42,3% of PSOE
MPs are totally in favour (a score of 10 in a 0-10 scale) of strengthening the
EU, most of the conservatives parliamentarians express different degrees of
moderate support to this political view, with only 15% totally in favour.

      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-4">
        <title>Governance</title>
        <p>The evolution of MPs’ attitudes regarding the scope of governance that should
be developed in the EU does not differ substantially from what has been
observed for the emotive dimension in the previous section. The main trend is
continuity, although some slight changes along these years suggest again the
relevance of the influence of the party competition. For the vast majority of the
Spanish parliamentary elite (Figure 4), the EC must become the true
government of Europe (86.6%), while the powers of the EP should be strengthened
(85.9%) as well as those of the European Central Bank (ECB) (71.1%).
Reflecting a paradoxical position, an important proportion of respondents also
supports the idea that states should remain central actors of the EU (65,5%).
This contradictory position actually suggests an interesting evolution since the
beginning of the crisis. Indeed, while in 2007 the support to a more
parliamentarian view of the European Union seemed to predominate (with 25 points of
differences between support to strengthen the EP powers and declaring that
states should keep their central position in the European governance), the
financial crisis has encouraged the support for a more executive view of the
governance (based on the role of the EC) to the detriment of the role of states,</p>
        <p>HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 225
with more than 20 points of difference between both statements (Figure 4). In
this vein, it is interesting that the support for the ECB role7 is stronger than for
the role of the member states. In contrast with these opinions, the support to the
employment of referendum to be used as a tool to take most important EU
decisions is much weaker (52.6%). It does not seem that the consequences of
the financial crisis could have altered the view in favour of direct democracy at
the European level. Overall, there is a prevailing view amongst Spanish
political elites in favour of a state-like democracy for Europe, supported by the
88.6% of the respondents.

idea of keeping the states as central actors of the EU decision-making (46.2%),
only a minor fraction of the PP group (12.5%) does not agree. On the contrary,
PP representatives are less convinced than those of the PSOE about the idea of
strengthening the EP powers (75.6% vs 96.2%). Similarly, two thirds of the
PSOE group (66.7%, and all the other left-wing MPs in the chamber) agrees in</p>

that the most important decisions concerning the EU should be taken by a
majority of all European citizens. In contrast, only 30.8% (most of them
agreeing somewhat) of the PP representatives agrees in this democratic approach.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the Eurozone crisis has clearly fuelled criticism regarding the
role of states’ interest in the EU’s decision-making processes (Figure 4).
Indeed, the amount of respondents arguing that the EU level decisions do not
usually take Spain’s interest into account has expanded during the observed
period, increasing from 17.1% (in 2007) to 49.4% (in 2014). This is congruent
with the strong view, shared by almost all the MPs, of the idea that the interest
of some countries carries too much weight in the EU (supported by 93.8% in
2014). Overall, this is an indicator of how Spanish elites have perceived the
erosion of the position of the country (as well as other Southern European
countries) in the EU compared to the central role of the richest countries.</p>
      <p>The financial crisis forced the EU and their state members to take action to deal
with the economic consequences of the crisis. The experience during this
period may have affected opinions about how the EU should approach such
challenges. On the one hand, there is a general consensus about need of EU
financial aid to countries in difficulty (backed by 96.3% of the MPs). On the other
hand, of the different alternatives to deal with the crisis in the EU, during the
observed period Spanish MPs have reinforced their opinion in favour of the
intervention led by the EU, to the detriment of state actions or the role of
international institutions (Figure 5). Between 2009 and 2014, the support for an</p>
      <p>HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 227
intervention led by the EU increased (as a first or second choice amongst
different alternatives) from 52.6% to 73.8%. In contrast, the choice for
coordinated action by national governments decreased from 76.3% to 67.5%. This
decline is mainly focused on those considering this option as their first choice
compared to the other alternatives (51,3% in 2009). Besides, the alternative of
an intervention by international financial institutions has lost credit, decreasing
14 percentage points, while an autonomous action by national governments is
the last choice for most of the parliamentarians.</p>
      <p>These choices are somewhat influenced by party ideology, as PSOE MPs
are less likely to back the 'states only' strategy compared to conservative
representatives. In 2014, the autonomous action by national governments was
preferred as first or second choice by right-wing MPs (difference +24.4) as well as
coordinated action of national governments (difference +11.7), while left-wing
MPs gave stronger support to the intervention by the EU (difference +20.2) and
to the role of the international fiscal institutions (difference +13.8). Moreover,
the effect of party ideology is particularly outstanding when the MPs come to
assess the role of EU institutions in the management of the Eurozone crisis.
While PP representatives give a positive assessment of the EU, the EC and the
ECB (around an average of 6.3 points on a scale 0-10), left-wing
parliamentarians express a worst opinion (average below 4 points). Finally, the ideological
divide is more generally reflected in the MPs’ opinions about which should be
the main aim of the EU. For left-wing representatives, this should be to provide
better social security (83.9%), while conservative MPs conceive an EU focused
on either making the European economy more competitive (31.8%) or on both
economic and social aims (40.9%).</p>
      <p>
        The scope of governance also deals with multilevel policymaking, i.e., the
changing relationship between actors situated at different territorial levels and
how policy issues should be allocated amongst them
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Jerez-Mir et al. 2010,
49)</xref>
        . In this respect, the preferences of political elites tend to follow the general
pro-EU support pattern observed in previous pages, with some exceptions. In
fact, while elites express more pro-EU positions in issues and policies dealing
with transnational problems, they are less conclusive in those policies
traditionally linked with domestic issues
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref19 ref20 ref23 ref24 ref25 ref29 ref35 ref8">(Real-Dato et al. 2012; Real-Dato and
Alarcón 2015)</xref>
        . However, since 2009 there has been a an increase in the
percentages of those respondents who prefer issues to be dealt at the EU level. We
may interpret this as a consequence of the failure of national and subnational
governments to respond to the main political challenges posed by the financial
crisis. This effect is general (but not necessarily homogenous) across all kind of
issues and policies, with two resulting patterns of evolution (see Figure 6).

In those issues where political elites where divided regarding which level of
policymaking should prevail (the EU, the national/regional level, or both),
there has been an increasing gap in favour of the EU in immigration,
environment, and fight against crime. Besides, in those policy areas where the
preferred policymaking level was the nation or the region (fighting unemployment
and health care policy), there has been a decline in support for those levels of
government parallel with an increasing preference for the intervention of the
EU (alone or in coordination with the other levels). One particular case is
banking and finance regulation, where there is a strong consensus around the
fundamental role of the EU in this policy area (84%).</p>
      <p>
        In some policy issues, preferences regarding which level must prevail in
terms of policymaking are slightly affected by the party ideology
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref19 ref20 ref24 ref25 ref29 ref35 ref8">(Real-Dato
and Alarcón 2015)</xref>
        . Therefore, left-wing MPs give stronger support to the EU
level than the conservative representatives in issues like the unemployment
policy (difference +33.8%), environment (+20.2%) or crime (+19.6%), while in
other issues party differences are less relevant or non-existing.
      </p>
      <p>The main exception to this general trend to reinforce the preference for the EU
as a central policymaking level is the security area, at least if we observe the
declining support for a so-called European army (Figure 7). While in 2007 the
preferences in this aspect were clearly in favour of European military
coordination (with an EU army alone, or also in cooperation with national armies), only
seven years later the situation is much less clear, with divided opinions
amongst Spanish MPs. We might interpret these changes as a domestic reaction
towards the rise of new threats to the national security, particularly the
destabilization of the Northern African countries, like Libya or Egypt, since the start
of the Arab Spring, or the crisis in Ukraine, and the failure of the EU to provide
a unified strong response to these security issues. Party ideology might help to
explain partially how this evolution has influenced the Spanish elite’s opinions.
Even though the increase of the support for the national army is consistent in
both left and right, the preferences for either an EU army alone or for the
coexistence of armies (European and national) are substantively different along
party lines: while the left-wing MPs are mostly in favour of a EU army
compared to the conservatives (48% against 23.3%), the development of a EU army
in cooperation with national armies is the preferred option for the conservatives
compared to the socialdemocrats (48.8% against 20%).

      <sec id="sec-7-1">
        <title>The Projective-Conative Dimension: Perspectives on the Future of the EU</title>
        <p>Our analysis of the conative dimension includes three aspects of how Spanish
parliamentarians perceive the future of the European project and its institutions:
which of the policies traditionally linked to the core of state sovereignty should
be fully Europeanized, which threats may endanger European integration, and
how MPs foresee the future of the EU in the long term. These attitudes are
particularly relevant to understand how the financial crisis and its consequences
may have changed what elites expect from European integration. As Best,
Lengyel and Verzichelli state, “the willingness to transfer control over
important policy areas to a supranational European level rests in a ‘progressive’
perception of Europe’s destiny and future purpose” (2012, 9).</p>
        <p>Regarding the Europeanization of core sovereign policies (foreign policy,
social security, and taxation), the financial crisis has had an impact in how
Spanish politicians view the political evolution in these specific areas (Figure
8). Generally, Spanish MPs’ preferences in most of these areas remain stable
compared with those in 2007 and 2009. It is the case of developing a single
foreign policy for all the EU members regarding non-EU states (48,1% strongly
in favour, 43,2% somewhat in favour), or setting a common social security for
the EU members (28,8% strongly in favour, 58,8% somewhat in favour). There
are not obviously strong differences along party lines in these policies. But in
the taxation area, there has been a significant change during the observed
period. Therefore, if in 2007 the proportion of those in favour of a unified tax
system was slightly below 75%, in 2014 such percentage increased up to a 85.6%
(40.5% strongly in favour, 45.6% somewhat in favour, including almost all
left-wing MPs). In the same vein, there is a strong support for developing a
system of collectivising the national debt through the issuance of Eurobonds</p>
        <p>HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 231
(39.5% strongly in favour, 53.9% somewhat in favour). In these policies, party
lines make some slight differences in the intensity of preferences (strongly vs
somewhat in favour) rather than between supporting or opposing the
alternatives, being left-wing MPs those who show a more favourable position for
common European policies.</p>
        <p>There are also some signs of change in the perceived threats to the EU. In
particular, some threats have gained relevance since 2007. The more relevant is
connected to the financial crisis itself and its political consequences: two thirds
of the respondents think economic differences among states is a big threat to
the sustainability of the European project in its current form, while the
corresponding percentage was only 42.1% in 2007. The economic effects of the
crisis may also spill over the political arena, in the form of the growth of
nationalist and state-centred positions. Therefore, a 74.1% of the MPs consider a
big threat that some countries put its national interest first, to the detriment of
the collective view of the European project. This second indicator was already
high in 2009 (unfortunately, it was not included in the 2007 survey). This view
of economic inequalities and self-interested positions in states as threats to the
EU is not corresponded when considering other issues. Therefore, only 39.2%
of the interviewees considered the competition from the emerging countries as
a threat; 25.6% thought the same about immigration from non EU countries,
and 22.4% considered the enlargement of the EU to Turkey a likely danger.
These positions clearly depend on the party affiliation of the respondent, with
left-wing representatives being mostly concerned with economic inequality,
state self-interest and competition from emerging countries, while right-wing
MPs were more likely to be concerned with the other issues.</p>
        <p>Conversely, almost all Spanish MPs dismiss the idea that the EU itself could
become a potential threat for the national culture and identity (only 2.5%
agreed), welfare state (13.9%), economic growth (12.7%) or the quality of
democracy (4.9%).</p>
        <p>Finally, Figure 9 shows the results concerning the views of Spanish MPs about
the future general situation of the EU in 10 years. Opinions among Spanish
MPs are definitely optimistic, though levels of optimism differ depending on
the aspect of the future in consideration. Thus, while about 85% percent of
respondents were confident that in 10 years the EU will be politically more
integrated and its economy will be more robust, this percentages was lower</p>
        <p>HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 233
when considering the future of the EU as a geopolitical power or that
differences between citizens (60.3% and 68.4%, respectively, were optimistic about
these issues).</p>

          <p>
            This article has offered an overview of several aspects of the Spanish political
elite’s attitudes towards the EU. We have employed the multidimensional
concept of Europeanness to integrate these views into a common comparative
analytical framework. The main results confirm that the longstanding
proEuropean consensus among Spanish national representatives
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref20">(Jerez-Mir et al.
2015b)</xref>
            has remained almost unalterable after the harsh period of financial
crisis and political turbulence. And in those few cases where significant
changes in the main patterns of perceptions and expectations are detected, these
changes usually reveal a strengthening of the support to for a more federalist
view of the European project. Therefore, in 2014 the average level of trust in
the EP among Spanish MPs was significantly higher than in 2009. Similarly,
the percentages of respondents who prefer that key policy areas of
contemporary governance, particularly those that are at the core of the current European
debate such as taxation, finance, immigration, and environment, are decided
exclusively by EU institutions increased in 2014 with respect to 2009. Besides,
this has also become the preferred alternative for a key policy area in the
domestic arena such as fighting unemployment. In contrast, one of the more
relevant changes comparing to previous results (in the 2007-2009 IntUne project
data) is the deterioration of the support to the national/regional level of
government as crucial reference points for decision-making
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(in contrast to what
was observed by Jerez-Mir et al. 2010, 51)</xref>
            . However, some negative
perceptions have gained relevance during the last years, related to the perception that
European decision-makers or the decision structure of the EU do not take
enough into account the interests of those countries, such as Spain, more
affected by the crisis, while the view that some countries carry too much weight
on EU decision making still persists. This is in line with the perception of
member states' self-interest and economic inequalities as the most important
threats to European integration.
          </p>
          <p>The pro-EU positions among Spanish MPs is also evidenced when looking
at their views of the future of the EU in 10 years, where a great majority
believes Europe will be more integrated and prosperous; and the minority
represented by those who think the EU constitutes a danger for the country's
cultural, economic or political systems.</p>
          <p>This Euro-optimism of the Spanish parliamentary elite may also have less
positive reading if we look at it from the perspective of the representative role</p>
          <p>
            HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 234
played by Spanish parliamentary elites. As we have explained in previous
pages, this pro-EU consensus was built upon the stability of the representation
of the main political parties (even though some changes in the parliamentary
balance between PSOE and PP). But this stability has run in parallel to a
deterioration of some aspects of the (traditionally positive) attitudes of Spanish
citizens towards the EU. Such deterioration has affected mostly to the levels of
trust in EU institutions, support for European integration, or the benefits
obtained from the EU membership
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref20 ref24 ref25">(Real-Dato 2015)</xref>
            . This differential evolution
of the views of citizens seems to be producing an increasing gap between these
and their political representatives. This gap might be partly caused by the
cognitive differences between elites and the general public mentioned at the
beginning of this article. But also, it could be an expression of what Peter Mair has
called the dilemma between responsibility and responsiveness (2013, 140).
According to this, the emphasis on responsibility by traditional parties to the
detriment of responsiveness to the electorate might open a growing divide
between “parties which claim to represent, but don’t deliver, and those which
deliver, but are no longer seen to represent”
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Mair 2013, 141)</xref>
            . Unsurprisingly,
the increasing gap between the positions of Euro-optimistic political elites and
Euro-critical citizens has developed during a time when both PSOE and PP
governments implemented very unpopular austerity policies. In this context,
parties' emphasis on responsibility may have eroded the popular basis of the
permissive consensus that has prevailed in Spain since its entry in the EEC in
1986. It could also be argued that the persistence of this gap between parties
and citizens could pave the way for new parties or political actors thriving on
popular disatisfaction with the economic and political situation and with a
nationalist or even Eurosceptic agenda. This might help to understand the
electoral breakthrough of a new party like Podemos in the 2014 European election,
which based its campaign in exploiting a highly critical discourse with the
political class and the austerity policies imposed by the EU, and claiming the
reinforcement of the role of the national institutions in Europe
(RodríguezTeruel et al. 2016). This raises interesting prospects about the implications of
party system change in Spain for the European project. Will the new MPs
coming from the new parties – mostly from Podemos – accommodate to traditional
patterns of Europeanness? Or will they transform them aiming to respond to
dissatisfied voters if the EU’s output-oriented legitimacy continues to
deteriorate?
