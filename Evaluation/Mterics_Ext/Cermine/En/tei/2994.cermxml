addition, her personal biographical development is retarded
by the exceptional, but probably not totally untypical
experience of being trapped within a situation of compulsory
labour (resembling slave labour). For a long time she also
feels obliged to remain in her trajectory position of an
isolated migrant worker, since originally she had mainly meant
to go to Germany in order to support her poverty stricken
family back in Turkey with her earnings. Partly based on
the fear that she will get self-alienated and “petrified” like
the older women with whom she dwells and works together
Hülya accepts a pre-arranged marriage (probably mainly
negotiated by her mother) as the only way out of her
predicament. But willy-nilly Hülya must learn that
she—already embarked on her way to an individualized and
emancipated existence—cannot live in such a superimposed
arrangement, and therefore she distances herself from her
husband through the biographical escape action schemes
first of returning to Germany alone and then of pushing
ahead her divorce.
1. Introduction: Common and Unique Features of Hülya’s</p>
      <p>Life History
The interview with Hülya shows numerous aspects of life histories of Turkish
migrant workers coming to Germany, which we consider as typical for the
organised work migration to Germany in the sixties and early seventies. But it
also shows features, which are unique and outstanding. Common structural
features are, for example, the institutional processing of the workers by the
recruiting, examination and selection strategies in Turkey and the intake and
exploitation strategies by German firms (in Germany). Of course, all of these
structural features are connected with deep experiences of extended suffering:
of being dehumanised by the selection and intake procedures; of being
alienated by not understanding the language and culture of Germany; of being
hermetically isolated; of being the despicable marginalized stranger, who doesn’t
understand anything of importance to Germans; of being emotionally and
morally disoriented by being a cultural hybrid; of doing hard industrial work which
one is not used to yet; of feeling estranged from oneself; of getting sick by
exhaustion; etc.—But there are some other features in the interview with Hülya
that are not as common as the just mentioned features. These other features
include:</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Hülya comes to Germany in 1972, when she is extremely young (she</title>
      <p>just turns 17 years old, and she still is almost a child at the time of her
arrival);
Hülya is a young woman, who migrates to Germany all by herself; and
she continues to stay alone as a marginalized person during the entire
fourteen-year period of her work and residence in Germany up to the
time of the interview;
- for one year—i.e., in her first year in Germany, when she is on contract
work in a slaughter house for chicken—her work reveals not just the
normal type of exploitation and estrangement features of the
underprivileged migrant worker’s occupational situation in general, but, in
addition, the features of compulsory work as typical for concentration
camp or slave labour organisations. This might be closely connected to
her biographical condition of being an inexperienced, shy and very
young woman, who does not speak the language and from whom,
therefore, the employer and his plant organisation do not expect any type of
systematic resistance;
- nevertheless: during her long stay in Germany, Hülya emancipates
herself from her rural family background and dares to speak for herself and
thereby overcomes a disastrous biographical crisis situation; she
acquires an emancipated and individualized personal identity;
- but most important is the following extraordinary feature: Hülya’s
intention to come to Germany is linked to an unbearable material
condition in which her family lives. She attempts to free her family from
the burden to care for her as the dependent youngest daughter, and, in
addition, she even intends to help her mother, father, and siblings—in
so far as they are still dependent—out of their poverty-related
predicament and of humiliating dependence on her oldest brother (who
took over the family household) by earning enough money in Germany
to support the family.</p>
      <p>Putting the common and the unique features of the life history of Hülya
together: Hülya develops an attitude regarding the course of her marginalisation
and cultural hybridisation, which shows many features of productive
individualisation. The question is how Hülya would acquire her remarkable
competencies for individualizing biographical work taking into regard all the disastrous
difficulties of her life history.</p>
      <p>
        2. Biographical Processes in the Life History of Hülya.
Biographical Processes up to the Life Episodes of a
Prearranged Marriage and the Way out of it Through Divorce
In order to understand the mixture of uniqueness and common features in
Hülya’s life history that is mainly patterned by her work migration to Germany,
it is necessary to briefly recapitulate the biographical processes and the most
important phases of these biographical processes in her life history. This
shortened version of her biography is methodically grounded on the analytical
procedures of text sort analysis, structural description, and analytical abstraction
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">SCHÜTZE 1983</xref>
        , 1984). Text sort analysis looks at the features of ongoing
interaction in the interview situation and at the differential involvement of the
communicative schemes of narration, description and argumentation in the
informant’s follow-up of the line of rendering of her or his personal
experiences. Of particular interest in this stage of analysis are background
constructions (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">SCHÜTZE 1992</xref>
        , 2001a), which deal with disorderly chunks of
biographical experience, and argumentative commentaries (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">SCHÜTZE 1987</xref>
        ,
1991a), which express biographical work of the informant. Structural
description is the analytical procedure, by which the unfolding of the story telling in
its formal textual features is articulated1 and at the same time the unfolding of
biographical processes is sequentially followed up and delineated (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">SCHÜTZE
1981</xref>
        , 1984, 1991, 1994, 1995, 2001b). Most important is the analytical activity
of “pragmatic breaching”, which envisions the formal and substantive features
of the autobiographical text as expressions of a recapitulation of re-enacting or
even “re-enlivening” (formerly) evolving biographical process structures that
the informant has been involved in. One basic step in the analytical abstraction
is the integrated follow-up of the sequential order and/or simultaneous conflict
of the supra-segmental units of the narrative text; these lump together narrative
units into integrated biographical contexts that reveal stretched-out
biographical process structures. The aim is to reach an empirically grounded concept of
the overall biographical structuring of the whole life history as told in the
autobiographical narrative interview (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">SCHÜTZE 1981</xref>
        , 1991, 1994, 2001a). In this
following article a full application of the analytical apparatus cannot be
articulated. However, I articulate my understanding of the overall biographical
structuring of Hülya’s life history by lumping together the narrative units of Hülya’s
narrative. I use the supra-segmental sequential organization of Hülya’s overall
autobiographical narrative as a guide. But this is only possible on the base of a
meticulous segmentation of the entire text into local narrative units or it would
be impossible to differentiate between segmental und supra-segmental units. In
addition, it would be impossible to appreciate the vague or even “oblique”
ways of textual rendering of disorderly and hurting experiences, which she
specifically expressed through background constructions dealing with her
prearranged marriage and her divorce.
      </p>
      <p>2.1. The family trap (ll.122-154)
In the beginning of Hülya’s life history there is her family’s collective
trajectory of being unable to autonomously support itself. Hülya’s parents do not
have the capacity to give a proper education to three of five children, still
de1 These include narrative units, sub-segmental phenomena (like background constructions
and descriptive detailing) and supra-segmental meta-units of sequential biographical
contexts dealing with biographical process structures (like biographical action schemes,
biographical trajectories of suffering, biographical processes of identity metamorphosis and the
pursuit of institutional expectation patterns of the life course).
pendent on their support. Hülya’s father became severely ill, fell into
unemployment, and has not worked since. He was not able to uphold his own
household, because he did not have health or invalidity insurance. Instead, the oldest
son took over, and he now controls the household budget covering all
dependant family members (including his father and mother). This might be a typical
intergenerational relationship in a rural society with patrilocal succession
(which goes back to ancient times). The oldest daughter is an exception to the
difficult situation in which other family members live: she married a well-to-do
farmer. Hülya’s family including herself took the opportunity to work on the
farm of the rich son in law during the summer season of harvest.</p>
      <p>The absence of the household autonomy of Hülya’s inner family means
humiliation for her father, mother, the bright youngest brother (who cannot go to
university), and herself. Hülya cannot get a vocational training, although she
has been successful in school. And nobody seems to be concerned about it—
contrary to the concern about the educational situation of her youngest brother.
Hülya is apparently expected to become a traditional housewife. (Later we
learn that Hülya’s father might possibly have had different ideas, but he had
been removed from his former authority position as head of the family—
ll.1074-1077.) In the early days of her life Hülya identifies intensely with her
mother, who cannot reign her own household and, hence, is unable to function
properly as a traditional housewife and mother. She suffers a lot and seems to
be emotionally quite unstable. Hülya doesn’t see any future perspective for her
mother, for her father, for her brother and for herself. She witnesses the
malfunctioning or even deterioration of the traditional rural family system in
Turkey. It does not fit the modern requirements for the development of
autonomous, individualized biographical identities which Hülya is oriented to; her
father’s advice probably plays an important role in this context. Taking into
account the absence of a protecting health and unemployment insurance
system, one realises that no welfare state or civil society serves as a substitute for
the lack of protection and social solidarity meant to derive from the traditional
Turkish rural family system. This explains Hülya’s subsequent high
appreciation for the German system of social security produced and permanently upheld
by state and cooperative institutions.</p>
      <p>2.2. Hülya’s biographical action scheme of work migration and
of supporting her family through it (ll.156-195)
Hülya develops the plan not only to escape from the family trajectory of
heteronomous determination, of being dependent on the (probably not freely given)
support of her very controlling oldest brother, of the humiliation of her parents
and herself and of not having any developmental personal future for the family
members and herself, but also to rescue her family from its predicament.
Having seen Turkish guest workers in the neighbourhood coming back from
Western Germany during vacation times, who seem to be affluent in their life style
(ll.145-146), Hülya at first fantasizes about and then plans to embark on a
labour migration to West Germany as soon as possible. Her fantasies can in
part be ascribed to having been misled by the show-off displayed by migrant
workers having come home; here we therefore have the opportunity to study
the power of “pull” mechanisms of labour migration.</p>
      <p>There are two features of Hülya’s action plan to go to West Germany as a
guest worker, which seem to be special. First, Hülya is the youngest child of
the family and it can legitimately be asked, why is she the only member of the
inner family who develops and pursues the plan to rescue the family through
labour migration? Being very young and female she seems to be the least fit
family member for this type of rescue action—to be accomplished through hard
corporeal work, which is associated with cultural alienation and social
isolation. Second, although Hülya painstakingly attempts to give the impression that
her family—especially her father and her mother—does not like to send her
abroad, it is her father, who finally assists in the legal procedure of “making her
younger” to the effect that she can apply in advance to the administrative guest
worker program. One of her brothers—probably the eldest brother as head of
the family—accompanies her to Istanbul, the location of the selection process
in the administrative recruitment procedure for getting promising (healthy,
bright, well educated, hard working) guest workers. He obviously is not only
her protector and emotional supporter, but also controls her pursuit of labour
migration. For example, he harshly criticizes her when she reacts with panic at
the long needles used for drawing blood for the compulsory blood tests.</p>
      <p>One gets the impression that it is not just Hülya, who pushes through her
biographical action scheme, but also that the family is indeed quite
supportive—perhaps even pushy—regarding her pursuit and realisation of the plan.
Though being the youngest child, she appears to be the least embedded and
least rooted within the family structure and social structure of rural Turkey; she
therefore is the one most “available” for uprooting and migration to Germany
(from where she serves as the supporter of the family from afar). In addition, as
the youngest child she can least be helped in getting a good education and a
proper vocational training at a time when the material position of the family
continuously deteriorates.</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>2.3. The intake procedure for guest workers that Hülya is encountering (ll.197-258)</title>
        <p>Hülya undergoes the institutional procedure of being tested, examined and
selected for “guest work” in Germany. This procedure resembles the intake
procedure of being drafted into, or incorporated within, an army—especially
taking into account the medical examinations and mental ability tests
administered to the applicants. But it also shows some additional features of checking
and scrutinizing that are harsher than any army intake procedure: scrutiny
resembling that given a horse or slave to be sold. In addition, a phase for the
presentation of the work to be done in Germany and for the signing of the
contract is built into the institutional selection procedure for guest workers, for
example, for activities of advertising and of formal contract reciprocity.</p>
        <p>The selection and contract procedures are formally controlled by the
national Turkish work administration agency. But they seem to be more
effectively moulded by the interests and interventions of German firms that plan to
hire Turkish personnel. Two facts reveal the low efficacy of official Turkish
control during the intake procedure and later on (when Hülya has worked in
Germany for some time). First, Hülya had just turned seventeen when she
underwent the selection and intake procedure and her age is not checked
carefully. Second, the Turkish labour administration agent visiting Hülya’s firm
(ll.390-409) does not—unlike Gogol’s “auditor”—seem to do autonomous
checks of the circumstances under which the Turkish labourers work and live.
He obviously does not check if somebody of the Turkish work personnel is
actually missing—in this case Hülya, who is severely ill at the time (due to an
accident at work) and has been hidden from his eyes by being placed in a
waiting room for a whole day with the false announcement that she was seeing the
physician.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, a systematic collusion between the public Turkish
labour agency and exploitative German firms apparently had been established to
the disadvantage and detriment of the selected and hired guest workers.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-2">
        <title>2.4. The biographical trajectory of compulsory labour (ll.260-409)</title>
        <p>
          During her first year in Germany, Hülya is trapped within the dynamics of a
prisoner’s or slave worker’s trajectory of confinement and forced labour. When
Hülya arrives at Germany, she experiences not only the normal type of
immigration trajectory
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(RIEMANN &amp; SCHÜTZE 1991)</xref>
          but also the much harsher
ones of confinement and compulsory labour.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Hülya’s case, the normal type of an immigrant’s trajectory means that for
a certain while she would not be able to proceed under the auspices of her
biographical action scheme of labour migration—earning surplus money in
support of her family back home in Turkey. Or more generally speaking, in the
course of a normal immigration trajectory expectation patterns—following up
the action scheme of establishing oneself within the new life situation in a
circumspect way, earning “real money”, and improving by this one’s own
material life situation—are impaired or even eliminated for a while. This is so,
since everything within the new life situation turns out to be different from how
it had been expected prior to the journey and immigration. The experience of
being culturally and socially strange to the new life situation, that is, of having
to live and proceed under conditions that are unknown, would for a while
overwhelm and impair the immigrant’s capacity to follow up her or his own
line of intentions and orientations by circumspect action. For a while, the
immigrant would only be able to react to the overpowering conditions of the
strange, very urging new life predicament. For example, she or he would be
forced to follow up the conditional relevancies of the new situation with its
unexpected necessities. At the same time the immigrant would also be isolated
socially. Especially due to the language barrier, she or he would not be able to
communicate with others and would feel alone. In addition, she or he would be
disoriented by the falsification of her or his own cultural and social expectation
patterns brought into the new cultural and social situation (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7 ref8">SCHÜTZ 1964</xref>
          a).
The immigrant would feel self-alienated by her or his incapacity to follow up
former intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, in the course of the normal type of immigration trajectory, the
immigrant would need some time to learn the ropes of the new social and cultural
situation—acquiring the language, managing to get in contact with others,
communicating with them, and understanding the regulations, conditions and
action possibilities of the new life and labour situation. All of this would be
quite difficult initially. But after some time, the immigrant would be able to
recover her or his own action capacities for following up the old overall action
scheme of earning surplus money and to improve her situation. For example,
Hülya could really start to support her family in Turkey, and in addition to this
she could develop a new biographical action scheme (e.g., to establish her own
autonomous existence in Germany). Of course, to a certain extent, she would
remain a cultural stranger. She still would compare her old cultural
expectations with the new cultural orientations that she has learned in between
(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7 ref8">SCHÜTZ 1964</xref>
          a, 1964b). But as such an “enculturated” stranger she surely
would be able to act autonomously again. In addition, as a cultural hybrid
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(BHABHA 1994)</xref>
          she increasingly would envision certain opportunities for
orientation, reflection, deliberation and action that are not open to
autochthonous members of the immigrant receiving German society. On the other hand,
she would still suffer from being positioned between the two cultures and
societal bodies as a marginal personality
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(STONEQUIST 1961)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>As mentioned above, Hülya’s new predicament of confinement and
compulsory labour is more severe than the normal type of life situation of an
immigrant. She gets deprived of her passport by having it stored in the
administration bureau of the recruitment firm, and she does not receive a permit of
residence for the whole time span of her work in the firm; her permit of
residence does not include the five days of extra work which are required from her
after the expiry of her contract and she is not aware of the specific legal
requirements, she only learns about them later on. The firm does not explain to
the newly recruited foreign workers what their civil liberties and work rights
are, and nobody else—for example, the Turkish labour administration or
German institutions such as the German labour administration, German unions,
controlling public bodies (e.g., the Gewerbeaufsichtsämter) or representatives
of the German employer organisations (like the Industrie- und
Handelskammer)—does this either. Hülya insinuates—and she seems to be correctly
assuming—that the firm deliberately takes advantages of the ignorance of the
newly recruited workers, since after the year of official contract nobody likes to
stay in the firm, and, instead of this, the firm recruits new personnel in Turkey
that too is exploited and systematically deprived of its work rights and civil
liberties. The firm does not proceed legally, but it is remarkable that it can
enact these practices in such a systematic and effective manner. Striking
structural similarities exist to slave labour in Nazi firms and concentration camps2
or—maybe this comes closer—to prostitution into which unsuspecting young
women from Eastern Europe have been trapped who are lured and often
“imported” to Western Europe.</p>
        <p>Hülya has to live in a small room with four others young women in some
sort of army barracks situation. She has to work from six o’clock in the
morning to ten o’clock at night: in addition to her normal work at the chicken
slaughter house assembly line, she cleans the workplace together with three
other women without receiving any substantial payment. The safety regulations
in the factory are poorly enforced. Hülya gets injured twice, and her medical
predicament is exacerbated by the negligence of the factory physician. In both
2 It might be seen as an exaggeration to state structural similarities between compulsory
labour in a concentration camp and Hülya’s overload of work in the slaughterhouse for
chicken. One could argue, that Hülya always had the legal right to quit her work contract
and to work somewhere else or—at least—to return to Turkey without a proper annulment
of the contract. And in fact, by physical force nobody endangered Hülya’s life at all.—But
on the other hand, decisive is the fact, that Hülya did not know about such alternatives. She
mistakenly assumed that she was forced to remain in her work position in the
slaughterhouse for chicken and, in addition, that she had to carry her overwhelming burden of work.
The management of the slaughterhouse systematically reckoned with the ignorance of the
newly recruited workers and was, thus, able to organize a hermetically closed system of
exploitation of its neophytes. In addition, there seemed to be at least some bit of vague
collusion of German state institutions, public agencies and professional bodies with the
management of the slaughterhouse: the union, the agency for factory safety and health control,
the governmental job centre, the chamber of industry and commerce, the local medical
doctors and local hospitals tended to look away, to circumvent the ominous establishment, to
keep quiet and to leave the inmates in all their ignorance about their work rights, health
rights and human rights in general. Although this collusion of German official institutions,
bodies and professional actors was vague, it was—in fact, on a quite systematic scale—
morally irresponsible nevertheless. (In this regard Hülya is especially critical about the
local union; see ll.421-422.) Hülya was not forced through physical violence to do all the
extra work—and at least formally she probably even got some extra pay for it, although it
was, then, factually reduced from her regular pay again. But she was systematically
manipulated to mistakenly assume that there was no alternative from doing that extra work. In
exactly this sense she was forced to do the extra work; and in this sense, too, the
management of the slaughterhouse had successfully set up a modern organisational arrangement for
compulsory work: it accomplished it through a cunning strategy of making use of the
ignorance of its dependants from foreign countries.
cases of accident Hülya does not receive proper treatment and is forced by the
factory physician or the shop steward to work until late at the night. The
management of the firm knows that the treatment by the factory physician is
inadequate: it would not have hidden the injured and ailing Hülya from the eyes of
the Turkish labour administration inspector.</p>
        <p>Hülya assumes to be forced to stay in the slaughterhouse for the first year in
Germany. She does not have her passport. She is in debt to the firm, since it
issued her an advance payment to her at the beginning of the contract. Hülya
thinks that there is no legal escape from the contract and that it is totally
impossible to change from one firm to the other during the first year, the contract
year, as guest worker in Germany. (The slaughterhouse officials do not correct
this assumption when they refuse a slightly premature ending of the one-year
contract.) It is a nightmare for Hülya to imagine the “worst case scenario”:
being forced to go home without ending the contract and returning to Turkey as
a failure. (The company probably knows that its Turkish employees do not see
a feasible escape from the situation by returning home to Turkey. Pride, self
esteem, reputation and the moral state of being righteous would be
overwhelmingly at stake.)</p>
        <p>
          The compulsory work situation has three features of biographical impact.
First, it isolates the persons in the same predicament from each other. At the
beginning of Hülya’s stay there is no solidarity of mutual help and consolation
between the newcomers and the other dormitory dwellers and co-workers.
Second, it is a life and work situation of extreme humiliation: Hülya knows
about her exploitation—too much and too hard work and far too little pay—but
she cannot change it. Her central biographical problem is to be forced into a
situation that is unjust and unfair. Moreover, her situation makes little sense
with respect to her former biographical action scheme of supporting her family
in Turkey. She realises that her suffering is not only an everyday burden, but
also does not matter in terms of future biographical developments and
perspectives. Hülya feels and fears to be seen as a grumbler after she has been injured
by the two work accidents and complaining about them and the pain involved.
Her me-images
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(MEAD 1934)</xref>
          are impaired. She would like to be seen as a
hard efficient worker and she feels to be approached like a malingerer. Third,
Hülya is forced to postpone learning German and being socialized into German
culture, because there is no chance of having private social contacts with
Germans (even buying groceries is difficult, since she has to work from 6 to 22
o’clock). There is no time and little energy left to attend any type of language
lessons. (It is remarkable that neither the employer nor the labour
administration or the union provide related opportunities or support.) In addition, there
might be an emotional barrier to learn the language and culture of a society in
which such a despicable systematic work situation of unfairness, loss of
biographical sense, and personal humiliation is possible. It is remarkable that
Hülya learns German and gets into German culture only eight years later, when
she seriously considers building a life in Germany rather than in Turkey and
after going through a pre-arranged marriage and her divorce. The delay of
learning German and getting involved in German culture might be due not only
to a lack of opportunity but also to a systematic attitude acquired in this early
occupational “hell” of enforced, exploiting and isolating work. This means that
work arrangements do not always have a socializing impact on acquiring the
competence to do collective identity work (dealing with the neighbourhood,
with networks of acquaintances, friends and voluntary associations, with the
cultural region, with Germany and Turkey as nation states and their productive
relationship to each other, with civil society and the welfare state, with public
discourse arenas, with Europe and the universal world society as frames of
moral and political orientation). The contrary can also be true. If work
situations are experienced as disastrous, they can retard the biographical
development of competencies for collective identity work (including learning pertinent
languages).

        <title>2.5. Liberation from the compulsory labour trajectory (ll.411-475)</title>
        <p>Nearly at the end of her first year of contract work, Hülya is visited by remote
relatives living in Hamburg, who have been asked by her own inner family to
look after Hülya. In this concern of her own inner family, especially her
parents, might be implied their consideration of how Hülya would be able to find
another job at all, since an extension of her first job contract seems to be
unbearable for her and should be avoided by all means. (However, Hülya does not
consider this question as the implied intention of her inner family in turning for
help to their remote relatives in Hamburg.) The remote relatives from Hamburg
immediately realise how deplorable and despicable Hülya’s present work
situation really is. They attempt to immediately take her with them. But the factory
management insists that Hülya would have to fulfil her contract up to the last
day; it even requires Hülya to work five days longer than that stipulated in the
contract, since her actual employment after coming to Germany started only
five days after her arrival at the factory location. These five days are actually
quite important in legal terms, because for them Hülya and her roommates
don’t have a permit of residence, since the one year permit expired five days
earlier. By accident the brother of one of the roommates realises the lack of a
valid permit of residence for the five young women, including Hülya, when he
attempts to take his own sister with him to his place of residence. (Not having a
valid permit of residence at one’s disposal would mean the danger of being
extradited immediately when checked by the police by chance or when getting
into contact with the governmental work administration or with other possible
employers.) The circumspect brother of Hülya’s roommate can manage to get a
hearing for the five young women with an understanding and professional
agent of the governmental work administration in a neighbouring city. This is
the first German state representative mentioned by Hülya who fulfils his civil
servant duty by professionally criticising and controlling the dehumanising
work exploitation practices that are illegally imposed on guest workers. He
checks the legal status of the five young women for their entitlement to work in
their former firm of employment and the lack of correct administrative
practices of its management to deal with that legal entitlement and the occupational
and civil rights implied in it in a direct phone communication with the firm
management. He criticises the disgusting administrative and legal performance
of the firm management right away and outspokenly. And then, without any
bureaucratic delay, he issues the permits of residence to the five young women.</p>
        <p>
          In the course of her liberation from the former compulsory work situation,
Hülya also becomes aware of the social base of sisterly solidarity and mutual
love between her and the other four roommates who now have to part from
each other. Only now, in retrospect, she can understand and appreciate the
mutual emotional support and practical help of her and her roommates for each
other as an important experience in her life. Only now she realises the value of
friendships apart from the family. This is in contrast to the solidarity platform
of the traditional Turkish family, which step by step deteriorates under the
impact of societal modernization, or at least does not produce biographical
welfare to its individual members. This realisation of the value of private
friendship is an important early step of biographical work that Hülya, in the
following years, will do so impressively. Hülya now notices that a network of private
friends is extremely important in a situation of isolated life as a migrant worker
separated from her own family of origin. Hülya starts to understand—and later
on she realises even more closely (see, e.g., the coda part of Hülya’s
autobiographical narrative of the main story part of the interview on ll.857-861)—that
in the future the networks of private, individualised friendship might become a
new platform of social solidarity in life situations of social isolation and
individualisation. This new solidarity platform might substitute for a
malfunctioning or even deteriorated platform of solidarity provided by the traditional rural
family in Turkey.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref20 ref4">(In her biographical insight, Hülya’s deliberation resembles
the analytical assessments of the early Chicago sociologist of the impact of
rapid modernisation, especially industrialisation and metropolisation, on the
biography constructions, social relationships and solidarity bases of modern
men and women, especially on work migrants and immigrants with their
“marginal personalities” [THOMAS &amp; ZNANIECKI 1927, PARK 1967,
STONEQUIST 1961])</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>With the help of her remote relatives from Hamburg Hülya gets a work
position in a metal processing firm in a small town near Hamburg. This might not
be the work she would have liked most. (First, the remote relatives tried to get
her into a big hospital as a nurse assistant or cleaning woman, but she was not
accepted.) But looking at her formulations in the text of her autobiographical
rendering (e.g., ll.819-823) it becomes clear that Hülya develops a biographical
identification with hard industrial work she would like to do with
circumspection, effectiveness, trustworthiness, dependability and biographical pride—very
much similar to the value features Max WEBER (1988) has conceptually
connected to the orientation pattern and cultural tradition of the protestant work
ethic. Probably Hülya does not like to be conditioned by a network of social
relationships that may be difficult to handle in her own family of origin.
Instead, the industrial work situation can be handled without much complicated
communication and negotiation.</p>
        <p>
          Having been rescued from the life and work situation of compulsory work,
Hülya intensely expects from the future to find situations that she can shape
herself and that allow her to have some biographical rest to start learning to live
in Germany. Not to find such a new life situation would be extremely
disappointing to her. After a first step of biographical work she seems to be ready for
a biographical metamorphosis (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">SCHÜTZE, 1991</xref>
          , 1994) of education, learning,
acquiring new cultural orientations, i.e. she yearns to leave behind the
depressive predicament of a self-alienating trajectory experience, of being the
ignorant cultural stranger and of being forced into a exploitative compulsory work
trajectory.
2.6. Intensification of the biographical experience of suffering in
a self alienating trajectory of work exploitation (ll.480-544)
Contrary to her own biographical expectation, the trajectory experience of
extreme work exploitation does not vanish when Hülya enters the metal
packaging and metal processing firm. This amounts to a very complicated
biographical problem constellation, since Hülya has allowed herself to open up to
new hope because she could finally manage to escape from the forceful trap of
compulsory extra labour in the slaughterhouse for chicken. Now, in contrast to
the experience of this extraordinary form of exploitation, Hülya must encounter
the “normal type” of a biographical trajectory of occupational exploitation of
migrant workers in Germany. She has to do hard bodily work and gets a typical
disease from it: tendovaginitis and the swelling of her operating arm, through
which she pursues her industrial work tasks. (She has to continually push heavy
levers for closing the lids of tin cans.) After two years of this extremely
strenuous work she has to change her work place in order to avoid having her work
disease become chronic and to escape from this mechanism of corporeal
transformation of her entrapment predicament of exploitation trajectory. But—as
typical for the fateful mechanisms of a full-blown trajectory dynamics—she
falls out of the frying pan into the fire, i.e. she has now to lift roughly 800
cardboards a day onto pallets. The total exhaustion of her body partially
conditioned by this causes Hülya to become dangerously underweight, although a
mental state of depression is also part of the structural conditions for her weight
loss. The latter of course is a second phenomenon of corporeal transformation
of the work exploitation trajectory and of the biographical experiences of
severe suffering connected to it.
        </p>
        <p>The private accommodation situation of Hülya is difficult, too. She has to
live with three other persons in a small room and at least one or two of these
other persons are on different shifts. In addition, all of these other persons seem
to be much older than Hülya. She always must keep quiet if she is present in
the room. Only later she can live with other young women, albeit they are from
countries other than Turkey, and since she is still not able to speak German,
that means that there cannot develop such warm feelings of mutual sisterly
support and solidarity, which she had experienced being with her young
Turkish roommates in her first place of residence when she worked in the
slaughterhouse. The life situation of Hülya is sharply exacerbated by the future
projection of her own life and personal development looking at the example of the
older roommates of her accommodation room and of the other older Turkish
guest workers in her new firm. Looking at the psychosocial features of these
persons she envisions a “natural history” of deterioration of the personal
identities of those guest workers getting older in Germany who are totally isolated,
do not allow themselves to conduct their own private lives and therefore are
just work and salary oriented. In Hülya’s view, these old and worn out guest
workers became personally isolated exactly by losing the social ties of family
and friendship networks in their country of origin. In addition, from the point
of view of Hülya, their ability to relate to interaction partners in Germany with
feelings of solidarity, sympathy and understanding permanently deteriorated,
too, because they did not understand that a substitution of the lost family ties
by other social relationships (e.g., of getting married in Turkey or Germany, of
engaging oneself in Turkish and/or German voluntary associations, of finding
Turkish or German friends) would be pivotal. In Hülya’s view, it seems to be
that they necessarily became selfish, de-cultured and extremely materialistic. It
is the perspective of Hülya that today, at the end of this process of “natural
history”, the old and isolated migrant workers envision themselves and their
work partners just as good or bad machine operators, i.e. as just biotic,
corporeal parts of the machine system, according to the rhythm of industrial work.</p>
        <p>
          One has to take into account that here Hülya is using a common Turkish
contrast set of categorisation regarding life in rural Turkey (with all its
expectation features of idyllic landscape, of freely given and trustworthy solidarity and
emotional relating to each other), on the one hand, and regarding the life under
the condition of industrial work
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(e.g., cf. MAURENBRECHER, 1985)</xref>
          , on the
other. But she doesn’t assume that this difference is just imposed by the clash
of the mental forces of two different cultures, but that it is caused by the overall
life course and life situation of the isolated and exploited migrant worker,
which conditions the deterioration of their personal identities and culturedness.
Hülya overcomes the common German image that almost every migrant
worker—especially those from Turkey—comes in “family packs” to Germany. She
draws the attention to the very fact that many migrant workers—and that is a
structural feature of the life of one important category of them—are utterly
alone in their German life situation and become even more isolated during their
time of permanent stay in Germany (because they are stigmatised, confined to
their own living quarters and self-restrained since they are not willing to invest
in social relationships to home-national, other-national and German partners in
Germany having in their mind the plan to return to their country of origin
anyway). Hülya has—as stated already—a “Chicago Sociology” type of
perspective on work migration to Germany, being progressively forced into structural
processes of social isolation and individualisation
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref21 ref5">(THOMAS &amp; ZNANIECKI
1927, PARK &amp; MILLER 1921, ZORBAUGH 1929)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>One of the riddles of the autobiographical narrative interview with Hülya is
the fact that she marks the biographical suffering related to her second work
position as even more intense than the biographical suffering in the
slaughterhouse for chicken. Comparing the work organisations of the two positions the
second one does not have the characteristic features of the compulsory work
situation as the first one has. One can find compulsory work situations in
prisons, in institutions of enforced prostitution and slave trade with women and
children as well as in concentration camps. All these institutions exert an
extremely dangerous impact on bodily existence and biographical identity. It is
remarkable, that Hülya herself reveals that she was always reminded by the
outfit of the mass shower room of the dormitory connected with the
slaughterhouse for chicken—it was actually an old school building—to the gas
chambers of concentration camps (l.455). But nevertheless, the biographical
suffering in the second work position and in the accompanying accommodation
situation seems to be even worse. Hülya marks the working-through of this
suffering as one of the important “switch stations” of her managing her migrant
worker trajectory. She delineates that experience and the biographical suffering
connected to it as a “hard blow” for her (l.512); she cries all the time (l.518),
and the janitor admonishes her that her permanent crying would finally kill her
(ll.527-528).</p>
        <p>There are three reasons for the utter bleakness of Hülya’s second work
trajectory experience: First, Hülya had hoped to escape from the trajectory trap of
exploitative and alienating work when leaving the slaughterhouse for chicken.
Understandably, she had assumed that her first work situation in Germany
would be extraordinary through its open illegality and coercion. Now she has to
realise that even under correct legal conditions the dynamics of the trajectory of
exploitative and alienating work, in which migrant workers in Germany can be
entrapped, goes on and on. She also has to acknowledge, that this trajectory
dynamics and its organisational structural context are an overwhelmingly well
organised system, and that her chances for escaping them are small. Second, in
her second work position and the housing connected to it Hülya feels even
more isolated than in her first work and dwelling situation, since she lost her
young solidarity group of sisterly Turkish roommates. Third—and this is the
most important reason—Hülya envisions, looking at her future life course, how
her own biographical identity could develop, when she would permanently
remain as an isolated migrant worker in Germany. She looks into the mirror
image of older women who underwent the isolated migrant worker trajectory
for extended periods of their lives. She realises the mechanisms of becoming
alienated from one’s own identity connected with that isolated migrant worker
trajectory. Of course, she stresses in her argumentative commentary
(ll.515522) that she is different in terms of her essential features of identity “lay-out”
as inherited from her family and home culture. But when she explains that she
is “still sentimental, sensible today” she insinuates that she has already gotten
hardened, too (l.519). It is a nightmare for her to imagine, that she could
become just a working machine and—connected to it—could get utterly selfish
and materialistic like the older women with whom she lives. She realises the
danger of losing her own biographical identity by a systematic process of
selfalienation connected to the isolated migrant worker trajectory. Now she knows
that she has to make a serious attempt to change her life situation drastically.
This is her next step of biographical work: to analyse the isolated migrant
worker’s trajectory and to decide to hinder such a gloomy development by
searching for a way out.
2.7. Hülya’s pre-arranged marriage as an unsuccessful attempt to
escape from the isolated migrant worker’s trajectory (ll.546-573,
671-731)
Not earlier than almost two years after her coming to Germany Hülya is able to
go on a vacation to Turkey. Only then her mother fully realises how much her
daughter has suffered: she is only a shadow of herself, having lost 40 pounds.
And Hülya, in turn, realises how much her mother, too, has suffered from her
being abroad: she became severely ill immediately after Hülya’s leaving for
Germany. During her stay at home mother and daughter—perhaps the whole
family—must have understood that Hülya would not have a realistic chance to
become affluent in Germany and that her worker’s existence in Germany might
be connected to too much suffering. And note again, that immediately before,
while still in Germany, Hülya had detected for herself the danger of becoming
estranged from herself by permanently remaining entrapped in the isolated
migrant worker’s trajectory in the future. The double insight of Hülya, on the
one hand, and of her family on the other, and the communicative exchange
about it between Hülya and her family, especially between Hülya and her
mother, must have been followed by thinking about a marriage for Hülya
during this first stay at home, although she doesn’t report it.</p>
        <p>During her next visit to Turkey, two years later (in 1976), Hülya gets
married to a relative belonging to the maternal part of her own extended family.
Hülya explains that she did not love her cousin (“...well, that was
...no...marriage with great love”—ll.556). And at the same time she conveys
two other tacit considerations that don’t really fit well with each other: that
there was no alternative marriage candidate available and that she generally
was not in the mood to get married at all (“..., but I didn’t love anybody so
much either or something.”—ll.556-557), since she was still exhausted and
suffering from her trajectory experience of an isolated migrant worker who did
not find the time even to think about young men. And in addition, such a
traditional pre-arranged marriage was not developmentally adequate for her
anymore, having already started to do the biographical work of one’s own life
historical personalisation and individualisation. The young couple remained
together only for one week (ll.697). Hülya gets a first impression even at the
wedding ceremony that her husband would not be the right partner for her:
“Well, we didn’t quarrel and so on, but I had...right at the...we...” (ll.696-697).
“But I knew this /eh/ right a way /eh/ that we didn’t harmonise. That it
wouldn’t end well, even if I would return home forever” (ll.706-708). And
during the one week of living together Hülya realises the difference between a
relative who is a nice, morally proper man and a husband to be loved: “Well,
you just expect something different from relatives and /eh/ something different
from your husband and ...He was .../eh/ not like I had ...imagined.” (ll.699-700)</p>
        <p>It becomes clear from Hülya’s way of storytelling that her return to Turkey
in order to get married was originally meant to stay in Turkey and live with her
husband there (ll.546-547). This assumption about her original plan is in total
accordance with her biographical insight into the migrant worker’s trajectory of
exhausting exploitation, of getting culturally alienated and of losing one’s own
personal identity—an insight, she could win by looking into the mirror image
of the older women living with Hülya in the same dormitory connected to her
second job. Hülya envisions her marriage as a biographical action scheme of
escaping from the exploitation and self-alienation trajectory of the isolated
migrant worker.</p>
        <p>But due to her experiences on the marriage day and in the following week of
living together, Hülya develops the action plan of returning to Germany for one
year; two years are not allowed by the parents by law and by her own mother.
Hülya gives as the official explanation for her action plan of returning to
Germany that she would like to earn the money for and buy electrical household
equipment and other household goods in order to let her future children learn
about the former migrant worker’s life of their mother (ll.565-570). Both
reasons given are not false; to the contrary, they are biographically plausible, and
they underline the life historical and individualized attitude of Hülya to her
own life. But on the other hand, these two reasons, why Hülya should return to
Germany again, disguise and rationalise Hülya’s new distance towards her
legal marriage partner. The change of her mind—first she plans to stay in
Turkey with her husband and not to return to Germany, and then she develops the
action plan to return to Germany to earn additional money in order to buy
household equipment—is only understandable by assuming that she has second
thoughts about her marriage and wants to stay apart from it for a while in order
to reconsider it.</p>
        <p>After her return to Germany Hülya becomes severely ill for a year, and
when she comes home again to Turkey one year later, she is still so weak that
in the beginning of her time there she can only stay with her mother. Not earlier
than during her last week in Turkey she finally visits her husband, who lives
quite far from Hülya’s parents. Hülya’s in-laws feel insulted by her late visit to
her husband, and he himself blames her for not having visited him immediately
after her arrival in Turkey and for not returning from Germany even earlier.
Hülya is very disappointed that he does not ask her about her health situation
and her suffering at all. Such a deeply felt attitude of compassion would have
been the only road for rapprochement and transgressing the conventional
expectation patterns of traditional gender relating and family life. But it is
obvious that Hülya’s husband is trapped into the mold of traditional male conduct.</p>
        <p>Hülya returns to Germany again not keeping the promise to stay with her
husband. After some argumentative letter exchanges during the following year
she decides to get a divorce from him since she acknowledges that he as a very
traditional man with his conventional ideas about male pride is totally unfit to
serve as an understanding husband of an individualised young woman having
lived alone for a long time. Hülya follows up her action scheme of getting the
divorce, although her in-laws and even her own mother implore her to stay in
the marriage. Through her autonomous action scheme of getting the divorce
Hülya emancipates herself from traditional rural Turkish family culture with all
its responsibilities and expectations. She pursues this against the deep wishes of
her own mother. The dissent and emotional cleavage between mother and
daughter must have been very difficult for Hülya since she loves her mother so
dearly, and she always kept a close emotional bond with her. But here, on the
other hand, she has to notice and to accept a dramatic difference of the outlook
on life between mother and daughter.</p>
