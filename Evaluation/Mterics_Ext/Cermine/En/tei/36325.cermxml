        <p>»Performative Sozialwissenschaft und Psychologie«. This article presents an overview of “Performative Social Science,” which is defined as the deployment of different forms of artistic performance in the execution of a scientific project. Such forms may include art, theater, poetry, music, dance, photography, fiction writing, and multi-media applications. Performative research practices are in their developmental stage, with most of the major work appearing in the last two decades. Frequently based on a social constructionist metatheory, supporters reject a realist, or mapping view of representation, and explore varieties of expressive forms for constructing worlds relevant to the social sciences. The performative orientation often relies on a dramaturgical approach that encompasses value-laden, emotionally charged topics and presentations. Social scientists invested in social justice issues and political perspectives have been especially drawn to this approach. Performative social science invites productive collaborations among various disciplinary fields and between the sciences and arts.</p>

        The term “performative” is drawn from J.L. Austin’s work, “How to do Things
with Words” (1962), in which he refers to the way in which utterances perform
various social functions over and above conveying content. Performative social
science involves the deployment of different forms of artistic performance in
the execution of the scientific project
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref17">(M. Gergen, 2001)</xref>
        . Such forms may
include art, theater, poetry, music, dance, photography, fiction writing, and
multi-media applications
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Madison &amp; Hamera, 2006)</xref>
        . Performance-oriented
research may be presented in textual form, but also before live audiences, or in
various media forms (film, photographs, websites).
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the social sciences, especially anthropology and sociology,
researchers have studied performances, such as rituals, games, dances and dramas, in
hundreds of cultural settings. These studies have generally been represented in
traditional textual form. This summary excludes these types of performance
studies because they are not, in themselves, examples of performative research
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39 ref40 ref43 ref7 ref8">(cf. Carlson, 1996; Conquergood, 1992; Schechner, 1985, 2002; Turner, 1986)</xref>
        .

      <p>
        The exploration of performative research practices is in its nascent stage,
with most of the major work appearing in the last two decades. However,
interest in performatively oriented inquiry has been increasing rapidly. Lively
controversy surrounds such efforts, in part because they raise significant questions
regarding the nature of science
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(Marcus, 1994)</xref>
        . Further, such exploration calls
attention to the various ways in which all methods of inquiry and representation
are performances. Questions thus emerge as to their comparative efficacy in
terms of achieving social ends
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref21">(K. Gergen, 2009)</xref>
        . The use of theater in
communicating about the nature of prejudice, for example, has a far different
impact on one’s audience than a graphic or statistical form of representation. A
performative orientation to research often relies on dramaturgical theory in its
approach to human action, although a commitment to such a theory is not
required by this orientation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref30">(Goffman, 1959; Newman &amp; Holzman, 1996)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The performative orientation to social research has many and varied roots,
both within the social sciences and without. In philosophy the distinction
between science and art has long been questioned, with scholars pointing to the
various ways in which scientific theory and descriptions are suffused with
literary tropes (e.g. metaphors, narratives), and guided by visual imagery (e.g.,
waves, matrices). In this vein, science is not defined by virtue of its contrast
with performance; it is itself a form of performance
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref28">(see, for example,
Arnheim, 1969; McCloskey, 1985)</xref>
        . Sociologists have also had an interest in
performance-oriented research. The field of visual sociology, emphasizing
photography as a major means of illuminating the social world is but one realization
(see the International Visual Sociology Association). For example, Mark
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref9">De
Rond, (2008</xref>
        a) in his ethnographic research of the University of Cambridge
rowing team, produced a flash video called “From Nausea to Method: The
Dark Night of the Ethnographer’s Soul” as well as a nonfiction book, “The Last
Amateurs: To Hell and Back with the Cambridge Boat Race Crew” (2008b);
De Rond describes his performative work as “carnal sociology.” Further,
sociologists invested in liberation politics, have found dramatic performance a
major means of engaging people in social change movements. The work of
Augusto
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">Boal (1995)</xref>
        is seminal in this respect. Jonathan Shailor’s work with
prison populations (2010) is a recent realization of liberation theory. Many
Participatory Action researchers also rely on performance practices in their
studies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(cf. Reason &amp; Bradbury, 2000)</xref>
        . For example, in her work with
Guatemalan women suffering from violence, Brinton Lykes has made extensive use
of photography.1 In psychology, the earliest uses of performance were largely
those of therapists. Jacob
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Moreno (1947)</xref>
        , Joseph
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">Wolpe (1969)</xref>
        , Eric
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Berne
(1964)</xref>
        and George
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Kelly (1955)</xref>
        all played an important role in demonstrating
the ways in which performance may be used for exploration, both of one’s past
life and of potentials for future action. Outside the social sciences, the late 20th
century emergence of performance art has brought to attention the potentials of
uniting art and social commentary for stimulating social change
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Carlson,
1996)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        These early contributions paved the way for a more recent flourishing of
performance oriented inquiry across a variety of disciplines. In Women’s
Studies, such developments have been stimulated in particular by the view of
gender itself as a cultural performance – as opposed to a biological given
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5 ref6">(see
especially Butler, 1990, 1993)</xref>
        . Thus when we engage in culturally appropriate
sex role behaviors, we are enacting roles as we have been taught to play them.
Other feminists have explored sexuality, embodiment, and power through
performative means
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref35">(Lockford, 2004; Ronai, 1992)</xref>
        . Issues of health and
medical treatment for women with breast cancer became the focus of a Canadian
theater production. This work, using patients playing roles related to their own
disease, was later published as “Standing Ovation”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Gray &amp; Sinding, 2002)</xref>
        .
Performance forms have also been developed by scholars in Gay and Lesbian
studies. For example, after Colorado voters excluded homosexuals from state
anti-discrimination laws, psychologist Glenda Russell
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(2000; Russel &amp; Bohan,
1999)</xref>
        transformed filmed interviews from the event into a television program.
This show, “Inner Journeys, Public Stands,” was then nationally televised. The
interview materials were also used as the basis for an oratorio, “Fire,”
composed by Bob McDowell and performed on several occasions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(see Russell,
2000)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        In the field of communication, important developments in performance have
emerged in ethnographic study. As scholars have developed autoethnography
to illustrate or illuminate various issues, so have they frequently experimented
with forms of expression
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref13 ref14 ref27 ref31">(Ellis, 1991; Ellis &amp; Bochner, 1996; McCall, 2000;
Pelias, 1999; see also Ellis, Adams &amp; Bochner, 2010)</xref>
        . Commonly,
autoethnography takes on the qualities of dramatic writing
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref34">(Ellis, 2004; Richardson,
1997)</xref>
        . With his graduate students, James Scheurich has produced a “research
happening,” designed to illuminate issues in immigration by bringing audience
members into interactive relations with artifacts and activities related to
Mexican immigrants, as well as a movie, “Labores de la Vida/The Labors of Life,”
with Miguel Guajardo and others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(Scheurich, Guajardo, Sanchez &amp; Fineman,

Johnny Saldaña, professor at Arizona State University, has transformed a story
from his adolescence into a theatrical piece called “Second Chair” (2008), with
his music as well as prose. Online presentations allow for greater visual impact,
with diverse forms of dramatic forms, music and text. A Special Issue of FQS
included 42 contributions, emphasizing performative research projects

        In psychology, performance studies were highlighted at symposia presented
over a five year period, 1995-1999, at the American Psychological Association
national meetings. Sessions were composed of dramatic monologues, dance,
multi-media presentations, plays, and poems, all treating a significant topic of
psychological concern. Another major innovator in performance studies is the
East Side Institute, where dramatic productions are integral to educational,
therapeutic and community building functions

        has co-created graphic and poetic representations of
theoretical views with artist, Regine Walter. Mary Gergen’s dramatic
monologues and textual formats, lodged at the intersection of social construction and
feminist studies, are among the earliest performative presentations in
psychology

      <p>As many qualitative researchers find, the traditional distinctions among
departments of knowledge are both artificial and insulating. Thus emerging are a
variety of publication and presentation venues that are non-disciplinary. The
annual International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry organized by Norman
DENZIN at the University of Illinois is illustrative; over two thousand
researchers gather to present their work, much of it of a performative nature.
Conference themes are generated around the idea that qualitative methods
should serve social justice goals.</p>

      <title>2. Theoretical and Methodological Premises</title>
      <p>
        Developments in performance inquiry have been primarily stimulated by the
emergence of a social constructionist alternative to traditional empiricist view
of science. From the constructionist standpoint, one’s observations of the world
make no principled demands on the forms of communication used to represent
these observations. There are no words – or other symbolic forms of
representation – that are uniquely suited to account for whatever exists. From this
standpoint, inquiry is invited into the limitations of traditional forms of social
science writing (along with graphic and tabular representations of the world),
and the potentials of alternative modes of expression. The use of performance
2 &lt;http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/issue/view/10&gt;; see also Kip Jones,
&lt;http://kipworld.net/&gt;.
as a form of communication in the social sciences is largely based on the
following proposals:
- Traditional communication in the social sciences is highly specialized.
Theory and research findings are largely unintelligible to audiences untrained
within the disciplines. If a scientific text can easily be read by the general
public it is typically viewed as “unscientific,” and discounted by gatekeepers
in a discipline. Thus, not only do social scientists largely suppress forms of
communication that might engage those who are the subject of study, but
their work is generally ignored by those whose deliberations affect the
future of the society.
- By expanding the possibilities of representation – using theater, art, or
multi-media, for example – scientists invite a more fully embodied response
from their audiences; performances can more effectively motivate interest
and action, and they can enhance dialogues on important societal issues.
- All forms of description and explanation provide models for action. In this
sense, written forms of social science communication are highly limited in
what they offer as models for action. Essentially one exposed to a limited
rhetorical style. By expanding the range of communicative possibilities, so
do the sciences expand the repertoires for social action. Employing drama or
film, for example, not only teaches about a given topic, but it also provides
new images for representation and action.
- Traditional forms of representation in the sciences are realist in their
rhetoric. They suggest that the discourses in use are reflections (i.e. mirrors) of
existing realities. By using performance as one’s mode of communication,
these assumptions are undermined. The use of theater, fiction, poetry, or art,
for example, suggests their aesthetic nature – that they are created by people
and are not “mirrors of nature.” In this way, performative representations are
capable of conveying the sense of truth, but simultaneously undermining its
grounds. They are not declarations of what is the case, so much as
invitations to “consider this way of seeing the world.” Challenged are the
distinctions between science/art, serious/play, and truth/imagination.
- Traditional forms of scientific writing radically truncate the potentials of the
language. Typically they rely on declarative prose. A performative
orientation invites the writer to explore the full potentials of the medium, including,
for example, irony, metaphor, humor, and more. While traditional writing
seeks to bring the full content into a logically coherent whole, a
performative orientation invites explorations into ambiguity, subtle nuance, and
contradiction.
- Traditional communication practices in the sciences suppress or disregard
the value investments and implications of the research in question. They
sustain the misleading presumption of value-free research. Performative
modes of communication typically make apparent the investments and
implications of one’s work. They often rely on dramatic tension to carry their
message, demonstrating that the scientist deeply cares about an issue and
wishes to share these concerns with others.
- When used in academic settings – for example, the lecture hall or
professional journal – performatively orientated work challenges the traditions that
have defined these locations as “truth zones,” that is locations honoring the
expression of those who possess the truth. The sciences thus become more
opened for the inclusion of multiple traditions, and thus they become more
polyvocal, dialogic, and democratic.
- Performative social science allows for close collaborations among various
disciplinary fields, from the humanities and the arts, as well as the other
sciences

      <title>3. Current Conditions and Future Potentials</title>
      <p>Although drawing from a rich history, the performative social sciences are in a
fledgling state of development. At the same time, the number of journals
featuring qualitative research has rapidly expanded; see for example, The Journal
of Qualitative Inquiry, Qualitative Research in Psychology, Text and
Performance Quarterly, International Review of Qualitative Research, and the on-line
journals, FQS, International Journal of Qualitative Methods, Qualitative
Sociology Review, and The Qualitative Report. All these journals discuss or feature
experimental writing, poetry, visual images, dramatic scripts, and other forms
of performative expression. Further, the Centre for Qualitative Research at the
School of Health and Social Care at Bournemouth University, UK, offers
graduate study with a performance component. Also a listserv related to
performative social science is available through a Sage Publications website.</p>
      <p>Both the enthusiasm for performative work and its contribution to social
science deliberations are substantial. There is also ample reason for optimism in
terms of the future of such efforts. This is not only the case in terms of the
present burgeoning of qualitative research across the social sciences, but as
well in terms of the opportunity that such research represents for the fledgling
scholar. Performative inquiry, as we have seen, invites the scholar to engage
with issues that have significant personal value. Thus, rather than being forced
by the profession to join dialogues the parameters of which are already fixed,
the performative domain invites the scholar into passionate inquiry. Further, the
domain invites scholars to use communicative skills (e.g., in music, art, theater,
dance) that have otherwise been excluded from their professional life.</p>
      <p>
        This is not to say that the future of such work is unproblematic. Of all the
developments in qualitative inquiry, performative practices are the most
radical. This is so because, unlike most qualitative practices, they challenge the
identity of the discipline. By blurring the boundary between science and art,
fact and fiction, seriousness and play, they challenge “normal science”
activities and standards. And, within the domain of the performative there remain
important questions. Three of these are prominent. First, there are difficulties in
judging the quality or merit of performatively oriented work. Traditional
standards for evaluating research (e.g., validity and reliability, statistical
sophistication) are not applicable, and new and more ambiguous criteria must be
considered. Standards, such as cultural significance, communicative power, and
aesthetic value, for example, are all subject to debate. To illustrate this
challenge, a recent PhD dissertation from the University of Bournemouth
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Zoë
Fitzgerald Poole, 2008)</xref>
        was encased in a wooden box, inscribed with a brass
nameplate, in which were placed two books, each page illustrated in colorful
graphics, denoting the outcomes of interviews, synthesized by the author, into a
poetic form. Also included in the box were DVDs with visual and auditory
expositions of the interview materials. As appreciative gifts to the readers, the
box contained music, a mermaid figurine, a large doll representing a stuffy
oldfashioned professor, chocolates, and hundreds of tiny wrapped up scrolls each
with a saying inscribed with elegant calligraphy. There was a map to describe
how to take in this collection, which had all been organized into small wooden
sections of the box. The dissertation oral, itself, proved to be somewhat
controversial as questions arose about the scientific merits of the research process and
the representations of the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second issue is that of the accumulation of knowledge and the progress
of the discipline. Traditional social science prized itself on these capacities.
Performative approaches are less committed to these goals, but more invested
in the meaningfulness of the research, and the ethical issues related to the
research process itself
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Keen &amp; Tordes, 2007)</xref>
        . In the case of performative
inquiry, there may be accumulation in terms of communicative efficacy, but an
investment in increments in knowledge and disciplinary progress is typically
replaced by a concern with making an immediate impact of cultural
significance. Performatively oriented scholars note that because patterns of social life
are continuously transforming, the emphasis on accumulation is misleading.
The social sciences acquire their significance not from attempting to predict the
future from observations of the past, but from entering into those deliberations
that create the future.
