INTRODUCTION</p>
          <p>urrently, the use of alcohol and other drugs is seen by the Brazilian public
health as a serious problem that requires actions geared toward prevention and treatment
of disorders associated with their consumption, with broad complexity and magnitude, since
their effects significantly affect the health and quality of life of users, their families and
society. Must be understood as a multidimensional and global problem, not restricting to
the relationship between the individual and the consumption of psychoactive substances.1-2</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>This being a social problem, there is a need for government intervention in order to</title>
      <p>prevent its spread and to promote greater support to these users and their families.3</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Accordingly, after the Decade of 90, there was the structuring of the network of specific</title>
      <p>attention to these people, by setting standards and guidelines for the Organization of
services that provide assistance in mental health, such as the centers of psychosocial care
(CAPS), ad CAPS included, for the treatment of users of alcohol and other drugs.4-6</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>Thus, the primary health care strategy in relation to the consumption of alcohol and</title>
      <p>other drugs is the ad CAPS using harm-reduction strategies as tools in prevention and health
promotion, particularly by supporting national programme for Integrated Community
Attention to users of alcohol and other drugs.7</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Guided by psychosocial model, the ad CAPS are proposed as a space of creativity,</title>
      <p>life-building, rather than delete, and should receive disciplinary medicalizing, care for and
build bridges with the society, considering the user in its subjective and socio-cultural
implications, electing him as the protagonist of your treatment.8-9</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>These nurses appears as a great contributor to this process of user assistance, not in</title>
      <p>isolation, but cooperatively with the other professionals involved.10-11 This study aimed to
analyze the general perception of nurses about assistance to users of alcohol and drugs from
a day-care Center. Had specific goals: characterize the nursing assistance directed to users
of the ad CAPS; identify the conduct of work used during the service to users, and describe
the difficulties for operationalization of the attention model proposed by ad CAPS.
METHOD</p>

    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>The study on the screen had the backdrop of the day-care Centre for users of alcohol</title>
      <p>and other drugs in the city of Sousa, Paraiba. With regard to assistance to mental health,
the town has a CAPS III (assistance towards hospitalization short), a CAPS i (assistance to
children and adolescents), ad CAPS a (service for users of alcohol and other drugs) and two
therapeutic homes, linked to the Municipal Health Secretariat. The ad CAPS has seven years
J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. 2014. dez. 6(supl.):90-101
of working with a team of twenty-seven professionals (psychiatrist, doctor general
practitioner, psychologist, social worker, nurse, artisan, diplomacy, physical educator,
monitors, Cook, administrative officer and general services assistants), and the nursing staff
composed of three nurses.</p>

    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>As for the type it is an exploratory, descriptive study with a qualitative approach.</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-11">
      <title>We used a non-probability sample of convenience constituted by 03 nurses who work in the</title>
      <p>day-care Center alcohol and drugs from the town of Shah-PB. To choose the participants
delimited as inclusion criteria: being a nurse, be acting in the ad CAPS there are at least 6
months and agree to participate in the study through the signing of an informed consent.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-12">
      <title>The data were collected between October and November 2011, through a sociodemographic questionnaire for characterization of participants and a semi-structured interview script with the intention of seizing the perception of subjects surveyed provided for research objectives.</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-13">
      <title>Worth pointing out that only one participant allowed to record the interview, others</title>
      <p>preferred to answer the written instrument. The interviews were transcribed in full and,
after careful reading, identified concordances in the context, that allowed the grouping of
topics, such as Thematic Content Analysis guides,12 which consists of discovering the nuclei
of meaning that make up a communication whose presence or frequency has significance to
the analytic goal targeted.</p>

    <sec id="sec-14">

time of operation of these professionals in mental health services varies from 1 to 6 years,
with 20 working hours to 40 hours per week.</p>
      <sec id="sec-19-1">
        <title>Nursing work</title>
        <p>The nursing staff of the ad CAPS de Sousa is formed only by nurses, not existing as
professionals in the technical level. Nurses are responsible for all activities,
bureaucraticadministrative nursing and welfare that can be divided into: individual calls consisting of
nursing consultations (clinical intercurrences), triage, greeting, note and contact with
users, administration and delivery of medication, checking vitals, orientation, nursing care
(the patient's evolution, individual therapeutic project); group sessions (groups of health
guidance and proper use of the medication); workshops and family care.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-20">
      <title>The professionals point to the experience and the fact that the team be</title>
      <p>interdisciplinary as reason facilitator for the performance of nursing activities, in addition
to the autonomy of the ad CAPS, to troubleshoot at all levels of health care users, the
availability of auto, the support of the Municipal Health Secretariat and the direction of the
institution and the identification with the work area. This can be verified in the
Testimonials below:
(...) There is an interest of the whole team to get resolutions on the
user, the municipal government help in various matters such as
material, structure, there's no shortage of medicines (...) has a car
available in the unit to go to the user if you did not attend the
service (...) there is a very large support that is given to us the
direction, coordination of mental health and all employees involved
in the process. (P1.)
First, I can totally relate to mental health, and especially with the
work developed in the ad CAPS, the team is also a big promoter,
since we are very united and we work really closely. Another
important factor is the level of professionals; we have enough
trained professionals on the team, so I learn a lot with them. (P2).</p>
      <p>Join a team with more experience and multidisciplinary, is very
important and very helpful. (P3).</p>
      <sec id="sec-20-1">
        <title>Difficulties faced</title>
        <p>The difficulties pointed out as obstacles to exercise the nursing work in service are
related to lack of training/training for professionals working in this area and the absence of
a satisfactory health services assistance (general hospital, outpatient services) users of
alcohol and drugs during the night. When asked whether at some point were qualified to
work in ad CAPS and what kind of training, respondents have positioned themselves as
follows:
(...) When we arrived in the unit I personally only seen thing of CAPS
on paper and little, was only a just class, so when we got here didn't
know anything about the CAPS and how it would deal with the user
(...). (P1).
(...) to start the work on this service wasn't qualified, however, in
the period that I started the team attending monthly supervision
proposed by the Ministry of health and it was during these</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-21">

      <p>Self-perception of nurses…
supervisions that many questions about the service were clarified.
(P2).</p>
      <p>There was a training made by the State, the municipal government
made a training project and in this capacity she was divided into two
parts, one devoted to mental health was made during the day at the
federal University (...) and the night was a system geared more for
the ad CAPS than would be the ad CAPS. (P3).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-22">
      <title>With respect to lack of assistance during the night period at health services users of alcohol and drugs, two of the participants emphasized:</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-23">
      <title>Most participants referred to the fact that the service is of type II, limits the ducts as</title>
      <p>well as the effectiveness of the activities carried out and consider that the ad CAPS or CAPS
12:0 am ad III would be a new possibility, qualified and effective assistance. And as
alternatives to improve the service, pointed out the need for better organization and hiring
more professionals.</p>
      <p>The lack of a more intensive care so we could watch the user in a
more complex, both during the day and night, for which we had paid
attendance during the crisis of abstinence but also during the Detox
phase. Another difficulty is the lack of specific programmes for
crack users, as well as the lack of investments in the training of
professionals working in this area. (P1).
(...) the ad CAPS is a clinic day, many users pass through the issue of
abstinence and the general hospitals of the city (...) do not want to
answer user (...) we evaluates and administers medication during
the day, but when it comes to the end of the afternoon send home,
he gets the care and suffering of the family (...) it would be
interesting to the creation of the ad CAPS III with ease of access.
(P3).
(...) We listen to our users on a daily basis the difficulty facing the
night on the streets, especially those who can't stay abstinent and
that require a period to Detox. The ad CAPS II limits the
effectiveness of treatment. Have the ad CAPS III 24 hours would be
good, because it would solve the greatest difficulty of users which is
the night. (P1).
(...) The ad CAPS II treatment needs to be complemented at the ad
CAPS III, since there are different stages of treatment. The ad CAPS
III would be for users who require intensive care to undergo a
detoxification and the ad CAPS II would continue treatment with the
semi and intensive not user I detoxified and abstinence. (P2).</p>
      <p>So that we have more effectively and efficiently in the treatment
proposed in the ad CAPS II need a CAPS ad III, as well, hiring more
professionals as an occupational therapist and social worker. (P3).</p>

      <p>The participants reported being part of a team that acts of interdisciplinary and
intersectoral manner.</p>
      <p>(...) The reform, especially in relation to the users of the ad CAPS
(...) Enables a resocialization. (P1).
(...) I see a great freedom of thought from the user, a larger range
of offers treatment options, he stays in the unit because he wants at
his interest (...) So in my view this reform of the psychiatric
evaluation for the CAPS for users with problems with drugs ad CAPS
is the great evolution (...). (P2).
(...) Everybody integrates and is part of all (...) on individual
therapeutic project all professionals will be part (...) so without the
weekly meetings to discuss the causes and problems of the users,
the people would be a bit lost in the treatment (...). (P1).
(...) We invite every once in a while someone from a. (...) currently
also the Masonic lodge does activities with users (...) the people
invites to do lectures teachers from the University, some users with
problems in justice, always maintaining this partnership. We are
discussing the possibility of a law favoring the drug user, who hire a
drug user pay less taxes (...) currently sense society has shown
greater interest in the person and not the fact that she use drugs or
not. (P3).</p>

psychoactive drugs by focusing on prevention. However, if we had a
professional damage reduction would be implemented more
effectively. (P1).</p>
      <p>Yes, people use the service damage reduction (...) with the time we
began to understand that these users were an evolutionary process

reduce the amount of drugs they are using is positive (...) the little

      <title>Of the nurses who participated in the research, it might be noted that these do not use the Systematization of nursing care (SAE) as a way of organizing the assistance provided, in accordance with the following lines:</title>

      <p>No (P2)

the assistance provided to the services performed in the ad CAPS, as evidenced by two of
the participants:</p>
      <p>SAE is a way of visualizing more complex clinical diagnoses of our
users and so we can watch them, too, so more complex. (P1).</p>
      <p>It is a way to view the user beyond the dependency. (P2).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-31">
      <title>Of the participants surveyed only one believes that SAE does not improve the assistance because it believes this applies better clinical pathologies and not changes of behavior and psychological needs.</title>
      <p>I think so maybe the individual therapeutic project is an adaptation
that we did for the CAPS than would be more like the
systematization of nursing care (...) the therapeutic evaluation of
the project here is long-term, the systematization as we get more
clinical patients she's kinda developed more to the clinic, such
assistance is kind daily (...) but here the more you go moving
surfacing the issues of psychological area you will see that they are
more in the long run, so this doesn't get daily revaluation (...). (P3).</p>

    <sec id="sec-32">
      <title>In relation to the family triad-user-professional, participants pointed out benefits of this relationship and it was observed that this is of the utmost importance, as you can see in the following lines:</title>
      <p>The benefits are when the family accompanies the user, the
treatment is more effective. (P1).</p>
      <p>Since the founding of the ad CAPS the symbol that we initially used
was a triangle with three hands, one hand would be the user, other
professionals and the third of the family, without the three
treatment doesn't work (...) the family participates enough (...) is
always interested in the treatment of users (...) without the
participation of her treatment is in half (...) the answer is being
very positive (...). (P2).</p>
      <p>Our unit conducts weekly meetings with the family because it is very
important to have this family-team interaction. Nursing has great
access to the user's family, since, in the vast majority, the family
accompanies the user to medical consultation, but also in the
delivery of medication. It is very important that there is feedback
between staff and family. (P3).</p>
      <p>The vast majority of households have a feeling of revolt with the
situation because they feel that there is nothing more to do for that
user recovery and that at any moment all come back again, so his
family wants to get rid of that problem, sometimes it's something
even unconscious (...).(P2).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-33">
      <title>One of the participants shows that the main difficulty in the family relationship with the user:</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-34">
      <title>Is explicit that this service professionals seek to carry out interaction with the family, considering it as part of the treatment team as you can see in the following statements:</title>
      <p>(...) as the family begins to understand what's going on, what is our
policy and what are the expectations, she spends to help in the
treatment and understand well the situation, becoming another
team to treat the user (...). (P2).
(...) We have to keep this family together and following the
proposed treatment, showing that you have a recovery time (...).
(P3).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-35">
      <title>Generally speaking, you can see through the lines of the nurses that there was a</title>
      <p>major breakthrough in assisting those users, but there is still much to be achieved in this
area, and especially in the institution search. The lack of training and failures in the
structure and dynamics of service compromises the quality of assistance provided. However,
to have a team committed to the therapeutic project, with the inclusion of the user in this
process is the best way to achieve abstinence, effectively.13</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-36">
      <title>The participants emphasize that the interdisciplinarity of the team and intersectoral</title>
      <p>approach in the municipality are facilitators for the performance of nursing activities. This
fact could be perceived through the autonomy demonstrated by professional ad CAPS to
troubleshoot at all levels of attention. This result is in line with a study, which found that
the professionals shared their knowledge and realized the need for training within the work
environment.14</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-37">
      <title>The insertion of the nurse in the ad CAPS seems to be facilitated by the good</title>
      <p>relationship with the multidisciplinary team that has, in terms of interdisciplinarity, the
ability to absorb the knowledge of nurses and recognize that this is important to the success
of the proposed therapy. The interdisciplinary work requires team members to socialize
their roles, providing reduction of hierarchical organization for collective work and
egalitarian.15</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-38">
      <title>The context evidenced in speech of participants consistent with the opinion of other</title>
      <p>studies by saying that the intersectoral approach must represent an area of knowledge
sharing, of structuring new languages, new practices and new concepts. Its construction is
part of a transformative process in plan, perform and evaluate the actions in order to
promote a reordering in the implementation of specific manifestations in the set of public
policies.16</p>
      <p>The difficulties pointed out as obstacles to exercise the nursing work in service were
related to structure and dynamics, as lack of professionals, absence of CAPS and support
services of empowerment/training. Referred to by professional dissatisfaction about the
absence of qualification confirms with the study that shows that nurses have received little
information and training about the context of alcohol and other drugs, which contributes to
the lack of theoretical basis.17 This question deserves highlight by little mobilization of
managers to offer appropriate training for professionals who participate in work as specific
as that service.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-39">
      <title>With the psychiatric reform it needs professionals in the area of mental health in</title>
      <p>order to achieve the necessary quality for watching humanly the user. The knowledge
arising from specialization courses or training programs allow nurses a better preparation
for dealing with patients with mental suffering and the possibility of creating new forms of
work organization, which consider the relationships between users, the team and the
community, in addition to become safe and self-critical about their assistance.18</p>
      <p>Of the nurses who participated in the survey, could not use the SAE, however,
understand the importance of this process and consider that their deployment could
improve the assistance provided. On this context, the literature states that SAE is vitally
important to plan and execute individualized care to the user.9 Nursing processes, linked or
not to theories of nursing, are based on the method of scientific resolution of problems and,
therefore, its proposal phases information, the problem definition, the option for a solution,
testing it by evaluating their results and trying other solutions if the first has not been
satisfactory.19</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-40">
      <title>According to reports, one realizes that the nursing staff uses a therapeutic project</title>
      <p>that meets the unique needs of each subject, in order to ensure that a link in the
relationship between nurse-user. Thus, the end compares the individual therapeutic SAE
project, because, in a way, systematizes the ducts and goals for each user with a unique
difference: there is no diagnostic formulation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-41">
      <title>All participants agree that the deinstitutionalization was and is a process of change</title>
      <p>that offers better expectations and freedom not only for the user, but also to the
professional. However, point to a flaw that possibly, if well-articulated, could improve not
only the assistance provided, but that would be the deployment of 24 hours CAPS.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-42">
      <title>It was noted further that the family is perceived as co-responsible for the user, but</title>
      <p>to see him accompanied by CAPS attempts to "abandon" the problem by placing the
responsibility on the team and only on the institution itself. Thus, the professionals report
that seek to encourage and strengthen this bond with the family focusing on the well-being
of every user.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-43">
      <title>Such a situation consistent with a survey conducted in one of the ad CAPS of Minas</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-44">
      <title>Gerais in the Southeast region, in which the participation of the family was so effective, not</title>
      <p>restricting only the meetings in which they discussed matters about the medication and how
to deal with particularities of the disease. In this approach, the family participation within
the ad CAPS must overcome the role of just object from the actions, but also become
subject to actions that get involved with the issue in order to promote the process of
reintegration and social rehabilitation, as well as the rescue of their citizenship.20
CONCLUSION</p>
      <p>The issues scored in this study demonstrate the importance of the process of change
that happened with the psychiatric reform movement, pointing out that the resocialization
and rehabilitation increases the freedom of users and professionals and allow ample
possibilities of interventions that, at the same time, produce care and give visibility to the
diverse demands of this population in relation to society. Such interventions should be
designed in such a way, using intersectoral the concepts of "territory", of "network" and
extended logic of harm reduction consistent with the guidelines of the Brazilian psychiatric
reform.</p>

      <title>The results evidenced here lead to new research, reflections, proposals and</title>

construction and reconstruction services, as well as the forms of intervention in order to
meet this demand effectively and primarily promote a concrete reintegration of these users
in society.</p>
