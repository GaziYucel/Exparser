          <title>Abstract:</title>
          <p>This article discusses some pivotal questions regarding processes of the intergenerational
transmission of trajectories of suffering in precarious places: to what extent can such
processes provide resources that foster agency, and to what extent do they rather constitute
barriers to living one’s own life? How much do intergenerational relations allow for
certain reinterpretations while discouraging or inhibiting others? Which reinterpretations of
the older generations’ experiences appear legitimate in certain contexts, and which are
rebuked by one’s social environment?</p>
          <p>In order to pursue these questions we present analyses of two very different cases that
are based on two forms of data material – the life story of Emma, a woman in her 50s,
and ethno-analytic group interviews with adolescents aged 14 to 20. Both cases are
embedded in very different regional and political contexts: the former, in the French system
of fostering institutions, and the latter a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank.
Both constitute, however, cases of intergenerational transmission of trajectories of
suffering. One objective of this article is to illustrate how the contrasting of such cases across
different kinds of data and contexts can be heuristically useful for methodologically
gauging the spectrum of the ubiquitous and sometimes paradoxical phenomena of
intergenerational transmission, in order to further develop its conceptualization.</p>

        <title>1 Introduction</title>
        <p>
          Intergenerational transmission is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has been
discussed across disciplines such as psychoanalysis, sociology, psychology, history,
and education. It comes into play when we debate questions of the very
reproduction of society, the relationship between structure and agency therein, collective
memory, the reproduction of social status and power relations, of historical and
family narratives, of cultural practices etc. The objects or contents of these
processes can be manifold, and of a very different nature or essence. According to
Daniel
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Bertaux and Isabelle Bertaux-Wiame (1988</xref>
          , pp.8‒9), there is not just one
sort of transmission, but many, and of very different objects or contents, i.e. “of
behavior and attitude models, values and bans, linguistic resources, perceptive,
cognitive, scholastic, communicational, affective, economic and legacy resources.”
Daniel Bertaux and Paul Thompson – a sociologist and a historian in reference to
the psychoanalyst Pierre Legendre – assert a universality of the desire for
transmission in intergenerational relationships. Moreover, they emphasize that for the
participants it is not so much the particular content, but the mere fact that
something is passed on and “that transmission to children in itself constitutes a
relationship transcending the limitations of human mortality,” (Bertaux/Thompson
1993, pp. 6–7). The latter emphasis on action versus content seems of particular
importance for research on intergenerational transmission in precarious
environments, where parents are economically not well off and socially excluded. In the
same vein, Catherine Delcroix, in her study on intergenerational transmission in
a marginalized neighborhood in Toulouse, asserts:
[It] is the act of transmission itself that is important over and above the content. In
families with few or no resources, where there is no objective ‘capital’ to transmit, there are
still the nontangible assets of moral values and love which, together with the family
history, can give meaning to the current situation (…). Communicating family history can
therefore enrich the minds of young people, whilst at the same time giving them an
identity which is other than that associated with their rejection by schools, the labour market
and by the way in which society in general shapes its discourse on ethnic minority youths.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Delcroix 1999, p. 187)</xref>
          Delcroix emphasizes that, in many cases, the only resource parents in such
precarious social environments can rely on “is of a subjective nature, composed of
physical, psychological and moral energy together with their knowledge of social
relations and sociability (…) which they have accumulated throughout the life
course”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Delcroix 1999, p. 175)</xref>
          . This, however, leads to the question of what
happens with difficult, even traumatizing elements, which often characterize
precarious family histories and life courses. Can they indeed be considered a resource on
which youths can draw – or do they constitute an object that cannot be conveyed
without overburdening the children? Is it at all useful for parents to relate life
stories that reflect a trajectory of suffering
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">(Schütze/Riemann 1991)</xref>
          , a phase in life
where they were not able to come to terms with the social reality that was
inflicted upon them? But on the other hand, is it at all possible to not pass them on?
        </p>
        <p>We discussed these questions during our participation in a French-German
seminar on socialization, gender and migration between professors, researchers,
and PhD candidates. This led us also to reflect on the concept of transmission and
how it could help us understand the diverse phenomena we encountered during
our fieldwork.</p>
        <p>
          In the following text we refer to a dynamic notion of intergenerational
transmission and not just a vertical or one-way relationship. According to Bernard
Lahire, who studied the configurations that allow the transmission of parents’
cultural capital in working class families particularly in relation with school, we have
to keep in mind that transmission depends on many exterior factors
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">(Lahire, 1995,
p. 274)</xref>
          . In the two cases presented herein, this requires us to question any notion
of transmission that neglects “the work, the appropriation and construction done
by the ‘apprentice’ or the ‘heir’”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">(Lahire 1995, p. 277)</xref>
          . To describe this process,
Inowlocki coined the term generational work in her research with families of
former Jewish displaced persons, in which the middle and younger generation
actively produced continuity by “trying to know and understand about oneself and one
another through each other”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(Inowlocki 2013, pp. 30, 41)</xref>
          . She develops this
concept in her analysis of scenes of personal interaction between family members, but
even if this should not be possible anymore, the younger generations can still
carry out generational work by reflecting and reinterpreting interactions with the
older generations. We postulate with Déchaux, that there is an “elective link to
the line” (Déchaux 2007, p. 92) that attributes an active role to the “heirs” in the
reinterpretation of the content of what has been transmitted. But if it seems
pertinent to question the notion of transmission in precarious environments, can we
talk about what
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">Attias-Donfut and Wolff (2009</xref>
          , p. 28) call “le désenchaînement
des générations,” a generational rupture or disconnection with which the children
of migrants are confronted, meaning they are “facing a destiny they have to
construct all by themselves”?
        </p>
        <p>The following analysis of two case studies (in part II.) will reveal some
unexpected dynamics regarding the questions outlined above. We present two cases of
intergenerational transmission of trajectories of suffering – or trauma1 – in what
can be called precarious environments, albeit in very different contexts: the
French system of fostering institutions and a refugee camp in the West Bank. In
both cases, the previous generation had migrated before our interviewees were
born; but in the first case, the migration of the older generation is contextualized
by French migration policies and the country’s economic need for labor power,
while in the case situated in Palestine, the older generation fled out of fear of
political violence or was in fact expelled. We are aware that both cases differ in more
than in this aspect: the data material consists in the first case of an individual
biographical interview, in the second case of consecutive group interviews.
Moreover, the interviewees are of a very different age at the time of the interview: in
the first case it is a woman of 58 years who by now is a mother herself; in the
second case they are young people aged 14 to 21.</p>
        <p>
          Given that our cases differ in a variety of aspects, our idea is not to compare
our two cases in the strict sense, but rather to discuss them in their similarities
and differences regarding processes of intergenerational transmission. This point
of view allows us to understand the “how” rather than the “why”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Becker 1998)</xref>
          and to gain an understanding of the processes that are in the background of our
two cases of intergenerational transmission in a precarious environment.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, discussing these two cases side by side was at first merely helpful
for finding out more about each respective individual case. But we soon realized
that both cases have more in common than one would suspect at first sight by
assessing their external criteria.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing discussion (3) we will reflect upon the common structural
dynamics and differences of both cases. However, we are aware that this discussion
is testing the limits of casing and comparing. Therefore, in the conclusion (4) we
will reflect upon the results but also upon more general questions of
“comparability” and casing, and the pitfalls and opportunities that comparisons of such
different cases imply.</p>

about how it is both specific to and representative of a larger phenomenon”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">(Wieviorka 1992, p. 170)</xref>
          , we here present two case studies in which we found some
interesting elements concerning the process of transmission. The first case study
(2.1.) results from Sarra Chaïeb’s research project on the experiences of members
of minority groups in foster institutions in France, and the second case (2.2.) from
Christoph H. Schwarz’s (2014) research on adolescence in a Palestinian refugee
camp. In order to better understand the cases, we will at first contextualize both
and outline the general research question and methodology.

      <title>2.1 Case Study 1: Growing up in French child welfare.</title>
      <p>
        By interviewing adults who were fostered during their childhood and adolescence,
Sarra Chaïeb’s research tries to understand how members of ethnic or religious
minority groups experienced their placement in two child protection organizations
that are historically characterized by religion (Judaism and Catholicism). On the
one hand, she asks how the two care institutions impact people’s life courses and
their sense of belonging, in regard to the socialization in their families. On the
other hand, based on interviews with professionals, she explores how individuals
and also groups of individuals – groups of migrants, for example – influence or
have influenced the evolution of the boundaries and the professional practices of
these organizations. The interview with Emma2 was one of those conducted in the
exploratory phase of this research, and is one which exposes the main topics that
also emerged throughout the subsequent interviews: the sense of belonging, the
construction of socialization between the institution and the family and the
contradictions this can cause, and the place of religion and ethnicity, among others.3
The importance of this question is underlined by the growing concern regarding
the evaluation of public policies, which tries to understand which resources can
help fostered children and which constraints can burden them
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Delcroix 2005)</xref>
        .
Despite the existing research on this question presenting a wide array of
methodologies and samples, and even though it involves various disciplines and fields, a
small number of recurrent issues crop up time and again
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Frechon/Dumaret 2008;
Chaïeb 2013)</xref>
        : success at school, professional insertion, physical and mental health,
and housing, as well as the impact of gender on placement trajectories
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref24 ref27 ref44 ref45 ref60">(Bauer et

        Compared to other countries
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">(Thoburn/Chand/Procter 2005)</xref>
        4, the specific
question of the fostered children’s cultural or religious background has only briefly
been broached by French research (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Gheorghiu 2002</xref>
        ). We try to understand the
way in which people see their placement trajectory after they have left care, to see
how they have structured themselves in this context, in which resources they have
found support (Castel, 1995), but also what type of socialization they have
developed between their family and the institution in which they have been placed.
Interpretations are thus based on their related memory. Using life stories seems to
be the most appropriate way to understand these types of data. For Daniel
Bertaux (2005, p. 36), “there is life story when a subject tells to another person, a
researcher or not, any episode from his lived experience,” which allows us not to
“impose a standardized interview” onto people, and to give them “the time and
place to tell their own story,”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Burawoy 2003, p. 436)</xref>
        . Formerly fostered persons
enter in what D. Bertraux (2005, p. 21) calls “categories de situation“ because it is
the situation itself that is common; they all passed a certain phase of their life
course being fostered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning the institutional situation, it seems obvious that the family, after a
certain period of fostering, does not play the role of most important agent of
socialization and intergenerational transmission anymore. Instead, the fostering
institution appears to take the parents’ place in the everyday life of the children and
youths. This idea leads to more questions: in the context of fostering, is there a
sort of institutional intergenerational transmission, too? Does the transmission
necessarily come from the family? What about the “plural kinship” (Cadoret 1995)
in the framework of foster care? In our case, and referring to the conceptual
considerations above, one might ask, which are the contents of intergenerational
transmission that are appropriated by Emma? What would parents transmit to
their children in a context of fostering? What is the link between transmission and
re-appropriation in this case? These dimensions can be considered regarding the
conflict and/or the idea of “plural socialization”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">(Lahire 1998)</xref>
        that foster children
are more likely to face. The case presented in the following, Emma’s life story, is
an example of such a life course.
2.1.1 Emma: Elements of her life course
Emma is a 58-year-old woman. She is married and lives with her husband in their
house near Paris. They have three children who are between 20 and 30 years old.
She has been a nurse since the age of 27.
      </p>
      <p>Emma was fostered again and again during her youth, often during short
periods when her mother gave birth to Emma’s brothers and sisters. Emma is the
eldest of a family of eleven children, and was born in Tunisia when the country was
still a French protectorate. Her mother is Kabyle Algerian. Her father, a Tunisian,
fought for France during the Second World War, in which he was wounded. He
arrived in France around 1955, when the country recruited immigrants as cheap
workers. He was housed, among other immigrant workers, in southern French
shanty towns, before he moved to the first public housing built for migrant
workers. Emma and her mother, who had stayed in Tunisia until that time, rejoined
him in France after 3 years. He subjected Emma to abuse and physical violence.
Her mother did not intervene, as a result of which Emma felt betrayed by her. The
successive pregnancies of her mother led to Emma’s frequent fostering, and by the
age of 10, she had already been fostered for 2 to 4 years in a children’s house,
because of poor housing and malnutrition at home, and to prevent tuberculosis.</p>
      <p>From the age of 10 to 14 years, Emma lived in a placement institution. At the
age of 15 she returned home, where she was again subjected to extreme violence
by her father to the point where he tried to kill her. He also battered her brothers.
But now, as an adolescent, she decided to press charges against him. In the trial,
her father was sentenced to 30 years in prison, whereas she was transferred to
another foster place, this time a religious institution. There, she was subjected to
sexual abuse by a priest. Furthermore, she was always rejected by other children
and continuously insulted as a “dirty Arab.” To escape from this situation, she
decided to run away from the foster institution just before she turned 21; she also
attempted suicide, but survived. Her later meeting with a social worker allowed her
to find a job. Later on she returned to school and graduated in nursing in 1980.
2.1.2 The transmission viewed as a constraint during fostering
In Emma’s case, the difficulty concerning intergenerational transmission seems to
be situated on two main levels: firstly, her story raises the question whether,
inside her family, a family memory was actually developed and passed on. Secondly,
which elements could be reinterpreted to keep a trace, an inheritance in this
chaotic life course?</p>
      <p>For a long time, Emma was ashamed of her family and of where she came from.
At the beginning, all the suffering that her parents subjected her to did not allow
her to refer to her family in any positive way. For Emma, everything seemed to be
negative and destructive.</p>
      <p>Emma: And after all these questions, there is everything that goes into pieces, and you
ask yourself “Why all this?” You don’t want to be a victim, you say to yourself,
“I’m sick of all that, I have to assume,” but you’re always ashamed, it’s very
strong. I was sometimes making up a story, not to say where I come from. I was
tempted to believe that my father was a big man in the army, that my mother
was the daughter of a tribal chief, you know, just for fun, to think that they were
nice people… After that, I told myself that it wasn’t the point, anyway I would
never be like that.</p>
      <p>
        Here Emma expresses the shame she felt, and explains the temptation of trying to
fend off this shame. This period seems to be difficult for her; she does not want to
be in the line of her parents’ descent. But even though the negligence,
mistreatment and violence she experienced from her parents reappear in Emma’s memory,
she later on developed something in common with them, some specific memories
which are mentioned in her talks. A part of what has been passed on to her was
hard to accept for a while: her face, first name and surname are visible traces of
what she represents for people. We can see in this interview extract that Emma
had experiences of racist discrimination at different moments in her life course.
The differentiated treatment
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Cossée/Lada/Rigoni 2004; Chaïeb/Cossée 2013)</xref>
        she
was confronted with – to be considered just as Arab while she just wanted to be
“as the other,” – can partially explain the reason why Emma has so much
difficulty to accept herself as Arab.
      </p>
      <p>Emma: […] it’s true, I always loved my job, it was all I could do to prove to humanity
that I could do something good, because during all this time, even during the
internships, people considered me a dirty Arab. In so far that I sometimes treat
myself as a dirty Arab too although I never recognized myself as Arab. Quickly I
changed my first name, when they asked where I come from. I couldn’t say that I
was Tunisian, because for me it was the reflection of my father and my mother
[…] But it’s true that I was thinking that maybe on my deathbed I will find the
courage to take my maiden name again and use it with pride.</p>
      <p>Thus, Emma sent a strong signal by changing her name and gaining some
distance from her family history. After that, she explains the joy she felt when she
took her husband’s name, which made her life easier, in particular when she was
looking for a job. She felt protected from people’s opinions but also from what she
disclosed about herself. Emma did not recognize herself in other people’s regard
and could not consider herself as a part of her parents’ cultural origin.</p>
      <p>
        The question of her parents’ origin seems to be one of the most important and
strong issues for Emma because it is central to her identity construction and her
relation to others. It is impossible to override this set of problems, precisely for
these two reasons. But how could one feel engaged in a positive intergenerational
relation with one’s parents, their values, traditions and general cultural frame,
when these elements are distorted by a violent climate of mistreatment? Emma’s
speech reflects this ambivalence very well: on the one hand, the paradox consists
in dismissing the elements that could lead to her origins, because she does not
identify with them. On the other hand, she describes a possible “return to origins”
– in this case reverting to her real first name – as an act of bravery.
2.1.3 The re-interpretation of fostering as a strategy to link with family
transmission
In Emma’s case, there seem to be two main aspects which come into play when
she reinterprets what has been passed on: time and the necessity to draft her own
life and her concept of self. Emma needed time to take a different look at how she
suffered, and building her own family was significant for the reinterpretation of
her life course. Studies on fostering often deal with the dimension of time: the
more time has passed after leaving the care institution, the more people can take
a global view on their fostering and develop resilience
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref59">(Frechon/Dumaret 2008, p.
8; Stein 2006, p. 7)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Time is indeed an important factor in the interpretation of events that
punctuated her life, and Emma succeeds in describing her life course from a positive
point of view despite what she went through. For a long time, Emma felt
resentment against her mother. Later, however, she speaks about the mother-daughter
relationship as not very developed, but as playing an important role in her life
course and the tenacity she found in herself:
Emma: I arrived after a tragedy, it was hard, but I hope… I think that she loved me. I
don’t know if she wanted me but nevertheless she took me in her arms. I think
that someone who copes, who isn’t mentally ill, who doesn’t commit suicide,
maybe such a person was, for the two or three first years of her life, touched,
kissed, liked… for me, if you had that, you can come to terms with all uproar, you
will always be better off than someone who didn’t have that.</p>
      <p>
        Here Emma manages to point out the positive elements that her parents passed
on to her, or at least she can see something positive in these elements. According
to her interpretation, the fact that she has been able to cope despite all the
hardship counts as proof that the past cannot have been all bad, that at least in her
early childhood her mother must have loved her and have cared for her. All these
elements form part of the construction of family memory, even though the
framework in which they evolve does not coincide with the norms of a “normal family.”
Time is fundamental for a possible construction, deconstruction and
reconstruction of a family memory that is passed on, and it is “beyond the individual [that]
fits in the movements of continuity and movements of rupture of families’ story, in
families’ links, in forms of transmission and in the content of inheritance.” There
is also a necessary work for each of us, beginning from what was passed on, to
arrive at “be yourself.” The family memory, according to A.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">Muxel (2007</xref>
        , p. 10), has
three functions: “a transmission function, in the continuity of a family story, and
attached to perpetuate the particularisms” (2007, p. 13); “a regeneration
[reviviscence] function which allows to stage memories of childhood time and family life”
(2007, p. 23); “a reflexivity function: it consists in learning about family
experience, have a distant view over the past, the circumstances and persons who made
you, do a temporary making-up of oneself destiny” (2007, p. 30).
      </p>
      <p>
        In Emma’s life course, the transmission and reflexivity functions go together,
because she is in perpetual questioning of past events. It took a long time to
accept what she experienced, the difficulties she went through, and the destructive
relationship between her parents and herself. When she speaks about her
brothers and sisters, she considers that they have not yet managed to take the plunge
in the comprehension of this family story. For her, there are two steps of
reconstruction: the search for a guilty person and the attempt to understand the
reasons for what happened. The dimension of social supports and/or of people who
play the role of resource in the life course is very important in Emma’s trajectory
as a fostered person
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(Goyette 2006; Frechon/Goyette 2013)</xref>
        . When she was young,
Emma met adults who became significant others, such as her school teacher who
took on an almost maternal relation towards her. The fact that Emma speaks
about her teacher in a vocabulary of love, as the love she did not have from her
mother, might indicate that this relation compensated for some of the lack of
affection on her mother’s part.
      </p>
      <p>Emma desperately seeks information about her parents and their life course.
Paradoxically, it is the very lack of information that increasingly becomes a
resource for her. After all these years of hatred towards her mother, today Emma
believes that her current objective may be to avenge her mother as a woman.
According to Emma, her mother never had a chance in life: she did not have the
choice to marry or to control her body. Emma defines her life course as a struggle
against injustice, especially against men, and feels involved in a mission:
Emma: […] I am on trial. I had problems with all the men I met in my life… and then I
put them on trial, so this means there is something wrong. I’m in a woman’s
revolt against men. As if by chance, from my father, to the educators, clergy,
employers, it’s always men, so maybe I rebel against that, or maybe it is the
rebellion of my mother that she couldn’t realize so I’m stuck with all that.</p>
      <p>Emma here tackles her female rebellion as the result of a mother-to-daughter
transmission, even though this might not have been her mother’s conscious
intention. She actively (re)constructs what her mother experienced as a woman,
appropriating these experiences herself, applying them to her biographical process, and
striving for continuity. Emma explains everything about her life story, her
mother’s difficulty to be a subject of her own life, not just because she did not have
intellectual resources, but because she did not have any access to the information
that would have been useful in a precarious social and cultural context. Hence,
she theorizes and attributes the basis of this rebellion to her mother. Emma, by
contrast, succeeds in being independent. Even if she speaks a lot about her bad
relationships with men in general, we can note that she found such a balance with
her husband, with whom she feels independent; she seems to have escaped from a
certain pattern of relationships. Another important departure from her mother’s
story is her job, which in Emma’s narration is depicted as a particularly important
resource for her independence and emancipation.</p>
      <p>Emma: My real freedom, it was when I succeed to graduate at 27; before this moment, I
was still under the yoke of authority … the authority of the man from whom I
rent my room, and the employer.[…] I keep all my work experience records,
because it’s really my pride to get recognition. Wherever I was, I did not have any
value for people, an Arab, a thief, a violent person, so I showed off my abilities,
because before they were buried. The more I succeeded, the more I found some
self-esteem.</p>
      <p>
        This case illustrates the concept of transmission and allows us to think of this
notion as a dynamic one. As a case of an “extreme situation” of transmission
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Bertaux 1997)</xref>
        , it can challenge the notion and point to some new dimensions. We can
see that Emma finds a dimension of transmission from her mother in her life
course in spite of how her mother acted towards her. Taking an active part in
reinterpretation seems to be very important in the case of transmission in this
precarious environment.

      <title>2.2 Case Study 2: Growing up in a Palestinian refugee camp</title>
      <p>
        This second case study is based on Christoph H. Schwarz’ (2014) research on the
structure of potential spaces of adolescence
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(King 2002)</xref>
        in Palestinian refugee
camps in the West Bank. In the West Bank there are 19 of these camps, and
another 40 Palestinian refugee camps are scattered throughout Gaza, Jordan, Syria
and Lebanon. The socioeconomic and political situations in these camps differ
from one another, depending on each camp’s relation with the respective political
regime and the juridical status it has granted the refugees. But despite the local
differences all of these camps seem to provide particularly illustrative cases of the
intergenerational transmission of a refugee identity and the concomitant political
narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first generation of the inhabitants of the refugee camps shares a
predominantly peasant background. Originally, the camps were established under the
auspices of international humanitarian organizations in 1948 in order to give
shelter to the approximately 750 000 refugees that fled or were expelled during
the course of the first Arab-Israeli war, which in Jewish-Israeli discourse is called
the War of Independence, whereas in the Arabic discourse it is referred to by the
term Nakba (catastrophe in Arabic)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref50">(Sayigh 1979, pp. 6ff.; Bowker 2003, pp. 67ff.)</xref>
        .
However, using the term “camp” already seems misleading here, as it is usually
associated with tents. Today, these camps can better be described as
“concretestructured slum neighborhoods on the peripheries of cities”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(Morris 2004, p. 1)</xref>
        ,
which in many cases are difficult to distinguish from the neighboring cities as
they merge with their fringes. Nevertheless, three generations after the Nakba,
the perpetual reference of the term “camp” is accurate insofar as it reflects the
political and social paradox that the camp is still defined as a transitory space, and
that expressions of the collective intention to “return” are omnipresent in murals
and statements. In contradiction to this, however, there is the everyday individual
need to come to terms with the current situation and the attempts to improve it,
which finds its expression in the construction of three- or four-story apartment
houses in the camps. This paradox also characterizes the United Nations Relief
and Works Agency (UNRWA), which can be considered an international
institutional framework for passing on the refugee identity and the respective collective
memory: UNRWA’s definition of “Palestinian refugees” includes the children and
grandchildren of those who had to flee in 1948, so that, due to the demographic
development, the more time passes since the Nakba the more persons are defined
as Palestinian refugees. By now, the agency counts approximately 5 million
Palestinian refugees
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref51 ref56 ref57">(Schiff 1995; Bowker 2003; Schwarz 2012b)</xref>
        .5
      </p>
      <p>
        Some authors claim that the refugees’ “livelihoods have stabilized after three
generations and their basic living conditions resemble those of the host country
populations”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Hanssen-Bauer/Blome Jacobsen 2007, p. 29)</xref>
        . However, the living
conditions in these densely populated areas are difficult, showing unemployment
rates above the respective national average, albeit a higher-than-average quality
of education provided in UNRWA schools; they constitute precarious
environments with limited perspectives for inhabitants and for future generations. As
other refugee camps worldwide, they have been in the center of armed
confrontations again and again.6
2.2.1 The affirmation of intergenerational continuity
The data material presented here is the result of ethno-analytic group interviews7
conducted from 2008 to 2011 in one of the refugee camps in the West Bank,
mostly with members of a youth folklore and theatre group. In their shows these
youths combine political theatre with dabka, an ubiquitous Arab folk dance in the
Levant. The cultural center where they practice – called Markaz8 here – provides
several community services and is at the same time a meeting point for
international visitors who want to get an impression of the situation of Palestinian
refugees – for example by taking guided tours through the camp – or who are
engaging in projects of Palestine solidarity networks.
      </p>
      <p>The participants in the first group interview were four boys and seven girls
aged 15 to 19 years, together with their trainer, 20-year-old Adnan. In the
beginning the youths were asked to talk about the history of their group, and how they
got to know each other. The first one to answer was one of the girls, Yasmeen (15),
who introduced the group as the “fifth generation” of the Markaz Dabka Troupe.
With this explicit reference to the term “generation” she directly located the group
not only in the cultural center but also in a particular intergenerational
relationship. It turned out later that the youths are being trained by the “fourth
generation” of the group (of around 20 years of age, like Adnan) and they themselves act
as trainers of the “sixth generation,” that is, children of approximately 8‒12 years
of age. By this, they reproduce the transmission of the refugee identity and the
militant struggle for “return” among the three generations of refugees, which one
of the boys, 16-year-old Maher, described later in this interview:
Maher: And you know here, the revo-, the revolution, the struggle, it’s moved from
generation to generation. Yeah. (...) Yeah, the big man is give like his gun or his-, his
thing to his child. And his child will do the same, you know? Like for me, my
father told me that there is a revo-, revolution and don’t forget Palestine and you
have to struggle, you have to do something, and the situation here is... you have
to do something. Because we live in a... a camp, we have friends in the prison, we
have friends who’s died, yeah. And ‒, and this thing do that ‒, that you have to ...
to struggle, yeah.</p>
      <p>
        Looking at structure and content of this passage from a perspective of Fritz
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">Schütze’s (1977</xref>
        , 1983) text sort differentiation9, Maher reports what his father told
him about the ongoing “revolution,” he does not contextualize this conversation in
a particular situation. No particular place or point in time is mentioned, the
interaction is less described as a relevant one-time experience than as everyday
practice; this, in turn, can be interpreted as an indicator of the ubiquity of the
narrative in the camp. Moreover, Maher does not mention his own reaction to his
father’s demand, it does not appear as a vocal interaction but as a message that is
received and accepted, giving the impression of a vertical, one-way direction of
transmission. Accordingly, he presents an argumentation: “you have to struggle,
you have to do something” because of the fact that they live in a camp, that
“friends,” supposedly of his own generation, died or were serving prison sentences
– both presumably because of confrontations with the Israeli security forces.
However, although the concrete means of “struggle” to which the group refers are not
outlined so far, the demand to struggle here was described as an almost “natural”
or logical result of the situation. Still, the argumentative form seems to indicate a
certain social pressure to engage in the struggle, a pressure that is not only
passed on by the older generation but also exerted within peer relationships.
      </p>
      <p>This argumentative mode also characterized the following course of the
interview, when Maher and Adnan took turns in presenting long statements, talking
about the general situation at the checkpoints, the imprisonment of minors etc.
Sometimes these statements also referred to their own practice as a dabka group,
which the interviewer was able to attend later. In these shows, the youths
combine folkloric dance and music with theatre playing, but the actors would not
articulate any monologues or dialogues, or sing songs themselves, which might have
given the performance or the enacted character a more individual or personal
touch. Instead, the narration that went along with the show came from a recorded
CD, just like the music, and the actors would dance and perform to it. The youths
enacted the Nakba and the ongoing political and militant struggle against Israel.
Moreover, they enacted the transmission of the mission to “return” from the older
to the younger generation: in the respective scene, one of the actors would die as a
martyr on stage and in his last words – again, from the CD, with underlying
music – would confer to his son the mission to never give up the land and to fight for
it, stating that it was the most precious and meaningful asset on earth – a mission
the son willingly accepted and re-enacted, with the other actors rising, joining in,
everybody raising their fists.</p>
      <p>But in spite of this militant presentation the youths affirmed already in this
first interview that “throwing stones” had not had the desired political effect, but
had only put the youth at risk. In the same vein, Adnan had at one point
distanced himself explicitly from suicide bombing – “I’m not with them!” he
reiterated twice10 – and declared that their mission as a youth group was to carry on the
struggle “in a new way,” by informing about the situation of the Palestinian
refugees on an international level; and like this, he added, “the kids” would also “see
other countries.” In the following he went back to the issue of the tours Yasmeen
had mentioned in the beginning of the interview, and put them in a much more
political context:
Adnan: For the new generation everything is, that means11, is changed. In the past you
didn’t have just one solution, just to fight. Now, I can ‒, by dabka troupe, I can
change, I can by, uh, our education I can change, I can change by a lot of ways.
Like for me and for them, we enter Markaz [CHS: Hmhm.], we enter the dabka
troupe and I remember the-, the president of... ah, not the president, the
president of ‒, ah... (…) For biiig ‒, for big center [presumably another cultural center,
CHS], they told-, they told us (clears his throat), I mean, you are 16, aaah, 16
kids, you visited Canada just for three weeks and really, really, you change, you
change... like the govern ‒, the Palestinian government in twenty years. (...) This
is the good thing. Not just to fight, not just to ‒, to ‒, told the people “We need
that, and we need that and we need that.” I changed how the people, they think
about us, there. This is the good thing, good. I mean, if the revo ‒, if the
revolution happen again ... maybe I accept and I agree with them. But I must tell them
there is a lot of ways.</p>
      <p>
        Maher, in the passage cited earlier, referred to the term “generation” in order to
stress the continuity in the process of intergenerational transmission of the
struggle, whereas Adnan very clearly highlights the differences between generations
when he states that for the new generation, “everything is changed”. He contrasts
“the past”, when one could only fight, to the current situation and to his activities
as a trainer for the dabka troupe. Moreover, he relates an encounter in which, as
it seems, a president of another cultural center praises and compliments the
group for its achievements through their cultural activity and their contribution
to the national struggle. However, what starts as a situation of praise and
compliment in Adnan’s narration soon turns into an act of argumentative
justification: When the revolution “happens again,” Adnan has to decide if he “accepts and
agrees with them” (without further explanation who he refers to as “them”). His
acceptance on principle granted, he argues that “there is a lot of ways,” which he
has described before as theatre playing and education. He thereby declares his
essential identification with “the revolution” but at the same time the possibility –
and the individual right – to choose how to support the struggle. Whereas Adnan
describes the past shortly as a trajectory of suffering – characterized by a loss of
control that leaves no option but “to fight” – the present seems to give more
leeway for strategic reflection. Accordingly, one can assume that dabka serves indeed
as another form of resistance in the asymmetric conflict with Israel, in the sense
of claiming a cultural presence and continuity and advocating for the political
project of “return.” On a psychological level, it might help the youths to deal with
political violence they experienced directly (although none of that is mentioned
here); moreover, it might serve as a means to deal with trajectory experiences of
displacement that were passed on by the older generation. However, it becomes
more and more obvious that their dabka practice also serves to broker
intergenerational and inter-factional power relations within their own community, as the
following paragraph will illustrate in more detail.
2.2.2 Adolescent strategies of re-interpretation
In the course of the subsequent interviews, which were conducted without Adnan,
and mostly gender-separated, the youths were willing to talk about more personal
questions, such as love or familial relations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56 ref57">(Schwarz 2012a)</xref>
        . Whereas in the first
interview the camp community was presented as a family-like community
showing solidarity to all of its members, in these subsequent interviews, boys as well as
girls soon complained about the sexual repression and social control in the camp,
stating that everybody would gossip and ruin the respective girl’s reputation, and
that parents would react with severe punishment. They namely blamed the more
conservative or religious factions in the camp as responsible for this situation, and
described the dabka group and the cultural center as potential spaces in a hostile
environment, and as the most important places where boys and girls could meet
without being controlled (there are, by the way, hardly any co-educative schools in
Palestine, and the UNRWA schools are no exception). All the youths expressed
their hope that their own children might grow up without such social control, in
more “liberal” circumstances. They often referred to the situation of youths in the
“Western” countries (Northern America, Europe) as a model. This, in turn, sheds
new light on their symbolic militancy – because it is precisely their role as
political representatives that allows them to travel as a gender-mixed adolescent group
(only looked after by members of the third or fourth “generation” of the group) and
in fact to create a temporary space beyond the crowded confinements of the camp
without the social control of their parents or the conservative factions of the camp
community. Taking into account that travels in general are a very adolescent
motive, their trips to foreign countries and the contact with foreign cultures and life
projects of other adolescents represent an important “potential space of
adolescence”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(King 2002)</xref>
        , because it allows them a certain reflective distance from which
to view the circumstances and moral values of their community, and Palestinian
society in general.
      </p>
      <p>In one of the later interviews, the girls also referred to what their grandparents
had told them about the Nakba. They stressed that their grandparents had kept
the keys to their houses to this day. Departing from this topic, they continued to
discuss their own hopes for “return” in a much more skeptical way than as
presented in their shows, or in the first interview:</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Aziza/Jamila: Yeah.</title>
        <p>Jamila:

        <p>And they have the keys ‘til the ‒, (in a low voice) ’til this day.</p>
        <p>That’s what I was about to ask... do they still have the keys?
But there’s no home (smiles) \ [CHS: Alright.] or no-, nothing there!
It’s just the keys. (giggles)</p>
        <p>\ (smiles) It’s destroyed!
So talk to me about the keys. What ‒, what do they mean?
Hope... That they...they have the keys of their homes, so... [Jamila: ~~~] they
think that they will come back soon. [CHS: Hmhm.] They come back//
Maybe not-, not-, eh, not-, ((ours)), how do you say that?
Not ours.</p>
        <p>Not our hope, like.. I mean, the keys.. (clicks her tongue, smiles) I don’t know,
because, ehm... (to another girl) go ahead, speak! (smiles) our Engl-, [CHS: Speak

ju ‒, they just have the hope. I don’t have the hope, [CHS: Hmhm.] like them... I
have but ‒, not like//
Nadia:</p>
        <p>
          Not the same hope like they do... they have. [Aziza: Yeah.]
In this passage, the hope to return is symbolized by the keys their parents or
grandparents still keep – objects of memory that will be passed on to the younger
generation, just like it is presented in political murals, slogans and songs, which
campaign for the “right of return.” Here, however, the keys are presented as
something that is not relevant for the girls’ situation as adolescents or for their
life projects. At some point they even seem to ridicule and laugh about their
grandparents’ hope, which might indicate that among themselves these hopes are
also a target of a certain aggressiveness towards the older generation. This, in
turn, is seen by some authors as characteristic of an adolescent detachment
necessary to reach autonomy and construct one’s own life project
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref25 ref8">(Blos 1962; Erdheim
1982; Bosse 1994)</xref>
          . Apparently, there are two very different “hopes for return,” and
their own project of return, which they so fervently defended in previous
interviews, once more seems to differ a great deal from the old generation’s concepts.
But after this passage, the girls discussed in an argumentative manner that the
connection of their grandparents to the villages was stronger because they had
actually lived there. 14 year old Nadia – the youngest of the girls – in the end gave a
conclusion, which, again, stressed generational differences, but was characterized
by empathy for their grandparents and for their hopes described as futile before:
Nadia: They’re old, they can’t just, you know... ~~~ ((leave it behind))
Jamila:
        </p>
        <p>(giggles)
Here it seems like she wants to make the interviewer understand their
grandparents’ condition, while Jamila is still giggling. Then again, in a later passage Nadia
stated:
Nadia: They told us to keep fighting, but there are ways of fighting, you know? Like,
ahm, I don’t have to hold a stone and threw it at them to say that I’m fighting.
(…) Eh, we can study and learn (…) many things and this is how we... can fight.</p>
        <p>Or dancing dabka...</p>
        <p>Statements like this one, which recall Adnan’s argumentation cited above, came
up quite often in the interviews, and were generally supported by the group,
which indicates a high relevance for the speakers and a kind of collective strategy
in situations of justification. Such argumentations implicitly indicate that the
realization of each individual life project in one way or another has to refer to this
collective narrative – otherwise, individuation would be considered betrayal. In
her last statement, Nadia once more emphasizes that the youths refuse to stick to
“traditional” ways of fighting, which – last but not least – might endanger their
lives, their health and their freedom to a much greater extent than dancing
dabka. Nadia does not mention more militant actions here, but her description is
reminiscent of a general political situation that has long been characterized by the
veneration for martyrs or Intifada fighters who are perpetually invoked as heroes
and paragons in the Palestinian public. Here, this (self-) destructive kind of
“fighting” is contrasted with the youths’ ways of fighting: even before the
mentioning of dabka, which is still a collective cultural practice that is directly linked to
the construction of Palestinian traditions, Nadia refers to studying and learning,
activities that can be used for a variety of reasons and for the realization of very
individual life projects.</p>
        <p>Taking into account that the whole “first generation” of the dabka troupe has
migrated, and by now lives and works in foreign countries, one can conclude that
the group might in some manner implicitly prepare for migration projects; the
narrative of “return” in this case appears as a framework through which
intergenerational (and inter-factional) conflicts are being brokered, and the youths’
adolescent strategy in this framework is to appropriate and re-interpret the narrative.
They are partly allowed to actually abandon the collective project of “return” if
they pay tribute to it by actively reproducing and embodying it on a cultural and
symbolic level.12</p>
        <sec id="sec-4-1-1">
          <title>Discussion</title>
          <p>The case studies presented here both offer examples of processes of
intergenerational transmission of trajectory experiences in precarious places. During the
analysis of the interviews it became clear that precariousness in these cases not
only refers to economic aspects, but also to the fact that the interviewees grew up
in places that are defined as anomalous by their societies and by themselves.
Being in these places means that “something went wrong.” Therefore, our
interviewees feel more compelled than others to deal with the question of where they come
from, where they belong, and where they might go, and to retrospectively make
sense of their family histories. With respect to the refugee camp and its dire
conditions of living, one could assume that – in accordance with Delcroix (1999, 2009)
– the narrative (or myth) of struggle and return is one of the few resources
parents can pass on to their children. It allows them to make sense of the current
situation and explain this very precariousness, and it might serve to symbolize how
much more parents would have liked to pass on to their children: houses, homes
and opportunities that now lie behind the Israeli border. If their children or
grandchildren overtly turned them down by not accepting the narratives’
concomitant mission, it might be devastating for the elders. The aspects of this
transmission are two-fold: on the symbolic level it refers to their parents’ identity
constructions as Palestinian refugees and acknowledges their trajectory experiences of
suffering; on an institutional level the narrative embodies their claims to UNRWA
and to the international community, which provide important services in a
precarious situation.</p>
          <p>In the situation of fostered children in France, the question of transmission is
crucial because of the role the institution of care plays, as it replaces the family,
and because of the importance of the fostering institution in the life course. In
Emma’s case, the family history that she (re-) constructed all by herself, and her
fantasies about the relation to her mother in her early childhood years appear as
biographical resources that enable her to make sense of her current situation, and
to develop and maintain agency. Institutional violence she had to come to terms
with during fostering led her to conceive herself as a fighter, and moreover,
involved her in a political struggle for gender equality. Furthermore, some of the
people who offered social support allowed her to (re-) construct herself. At first
sight, the most important entity of intergenerational transmission in this case
appears to be the foster institution that replaces the family. However, it was
precisely by reconstructing her family narrative that Emma was enabled to gain a
reflexive distance from this institution and to pursue a process of further individuation.
Simultaneously, she engages in a process of politicization of her own case, as she
deals with the power relations at the intersection of migration/racism and
patriarchal oppression, and defines them as the central theme of her life story.</p>
          <p>
            However, for our discussion, the most important difference between both cases
seems to be the level of explicitness and grade of symbolization of transmission.
These aspects obviously determine the respective strategies of the interviewees
and the character of their generational work: in Emma’s case, the content of
familial transmission appears unclear and has to be reconstructed all by herself,
whereas in the case of the dabka group, the transmitted narrative permeates all
aspects of life, imposes a very explicit political project onto the younger
generation, and functions as a myth, in the sense that it offers ready-made explanations
for everyday life. Albeit very different in structure and context, in both cases the
processes of intergenerational transmission and their respective grade of
explicitness appear as both resources and obstacles and are pervaded by tensions and
contradictions. Regarding the dabka group, the paradox apparently consists in the
youths re-enacting and paying tribute to the myth, and the more they embody the
project of return onstage, the more they are allowed to individuate and in fact
diverge from both myth and collective project when it comes to their own life
projects. In this sense, they use the narrative of return as a symbolic resource – not
only in the struggle against Israel, but also in intergenerational and

            . In Emma’s story the lack of a common language, which does not
allow verbal communication with her parents, and therefore at first appears to be
an obstacle, is in retrospect used as a biographic resource, offering a certain
leeway for active re-interpretation of the family history, which in turn is used to
come to terms with the traumatizing foster experience. In both cases,
reinterpretation is crucial in order to lead one’s own life.

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>
            Together with Howard
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">Becker and Charles Ragin (1992</xref>
            ) we asked ourselves
“What is this a case of?” We claim that these are cases of intergenerational
transmission in precarious places, extreme cases in the sense that in the first the
process of transmission is highly obscure and in the second it is highly explicit. The
respective younger generation’s strategies of appropriation of the content that was
passed on differ according to this level of symbolization.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the somewhat abstract notion of “appropriation” and case structure
only developed in the course of our discussion of the cases, and it would be difficult
to do this “casing” beforehand, before speaking to the interviewees, or merely
referring to exterior data. We at first had the impression that our cases differed a
great deal when it came to a certain “common denominator” that was yet to be
identified and theoretically conceptualized. So, going back even further, to the
question “What is a case?” we would claim that, categorizing these cases as cases
of intergenerational transmission results from the process of research and
discussion itself, because of the relevance of the issue for our informants. Our
informants implicitly outlined their respective strategies of re-interpretation to us and
made use of the interview situation to reflect upon them. Regarding the
methodology for the research on processes of intergenerational transmission, both life
stories and ethno-analytic group interviews are examples of very open approaches of
“data retrieval,” and it is precisely this openness that might allow interviewees
not only to convey, but also to reflect on their experiences, which in turn might
result in generational work, if they seek to produce continuity. In Emma’s case, it
seems that she made use of the research situation as a potential space in order to
interpret or re-interpret experiences that were passed on to her, and to actively
reconstruct her life story. The intimacy of the life story approach allows Emma to
constructively assert a posture of reflexivity. Life story telling allows looking at
the process in action, and provides the possibility of understanding the
“diachronic dimension”
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Bertaux 2005, p. 13)</xref>
            especially of life courses and how processes of
intergenerational transmission are embedded therein. The case of the Palestinian
youths illustrates the potential of open group interviews in researching how
intergenerational transmissions are brokered in adolescent peer groups, and how
group dynamics interfere with hegemonic discourses and individual as well as
collective self-concepts. The weight of the violence suffered by former generations
and of the collective myth built in reaction is obvious – however, it becomes also
salient to what extent the dynamics of peer groups can constitute a resource for
individual development. Here we cannot delve deeper into the development of the
research relation, but also in this case the group used the consecutive talks in
order to discuss norms that before seemed to be taken for granted. In this case, a
political mission and a transmitted collective narrative resulting from an
asymmetric military-political conflict are moreover used to broker a latent conflict between
generations; apparently, processes of individuation are only possible if the latter
conflict maintains its latent character.
          </p>
          <p>Albeit very different regarding their data form, context, and age of the
interviewees, both cases can serve as contrasting cases in order to map the field of
intergenerational transmission of trajectories of suffering in precarious
environments, and the coping strategies the following generations develop therein. A
particular strength of explorative and qualitative research is to find
“counterintuitive cases,” cases that do not fit into the scheme we have expected so far.
Heuristically, such a contrast of cases, which at first sight do not seem to have a
lot in common, may help to illustrate the sometimes paradoxical dynamics of
intergenerational transmission.</p>

      <title>Notes</title>
      <p>
        1 It seems obvious that in the two cases discussed here the experiences passed on by the
older generation were traumatic; in addition to that we assume that our interviewees
suffered traumatic experiences later on in their biography and might continue to do so.
However, the aim of this article is not to identify transgenerational traumatization or
to clinically distinguish between those experiences passed on by the older generation
and those that were actually experienced by the interviewees themselves. We assume
that trauma was passed on, but that predicting results of this transmission would
mean to ignore precisely the capacity of the younger generation to actively make sense
of it. Therefore, our focus lies on the younger generation’s reinterpretations and their
active role in dealing with what is passed on to them.

3 To briefly contextualize the field of French child welfare: according to ONED’s
estimation, at the end of 2011, the number of minors supported by child welfare was
approximately 275 000 and the number of young adults between 18 and 21 years old was
about 21 000. Among all these children concerned by child protection measure,
approximately 133 000 children are outplaced in foster families of in institution.
4 This question appears in the international European context. The UN Convention on
the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) contains articles that relate to religion or ethnic
origins (Articles 2‒14‒30).
5 This is a central difference between UNRWA’s and UNHCR’s definition of who is to be
considered a refugee. According to UNHCR’s definition, this status cannot be passed
on. UNHCR was founded in 1950, one year after UNRWA, and caters to all other
refugees worldwide. This difference and a more detailed comparison between UNRWA and
UNHCR reveal an important shift of the international community’s strategy to react to
refugee crises. According to Benjamin Schiff, “UNRWA is surviving, because the
conditions for its founding and perpetuation continue, but, as an international organization,
it is an evolutionary dead end. It provides assistance vital to the Palestinian refugees
and valuable lessons for other aid agencies, but the United Nations learned from its
UNRWA experience never again to create an organization dedicated indefinitely to the
care of a single refugee group.”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">(Schiff 1995, p. 270)</xref>
        6 That accounts not only for armed confrontations with Israeli forces in West Bank and
Gaza, but also for the “War of the Camps” (1985–1987) in the course of the Lebanese
civil war or, currently, the confrontations and the ensuing siege the Syrian army
imposed on the Palestinian Refugee Camp Yarmouk in Damascus.
7 The methodology of ethno-analysis/ethno-hermeneutics was developed by Hans
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Bosse
(1979)</xref>
        and combines the perspectives of ethno-psychoanalysis and group analysis. It
focuses on the research situation, especially the group dynamics and research
relationship developing therein
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11 ref12 ref55 ref58 ref9">(Bosse 1979, 1994, 1996, 2007; Schwarz 2010, 2014)</xref>
        . However,
in order to not complicate the contrast of this case with the first one, the
interpretations presented in this article are mainly based on an adapted narrative analysis
inspired by Fritz
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">Schütze (1977</xref>
        , 1983) and Gerhard
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">Riemann (1985</xref>
        , 1986).
8 All names of institutions and persons were replaced by pseudonyms, and all local
references altered by the authors in order to guarantee the anonymity of the
interviewees.
9 The notion of narratives in this case study is applied in a twofold sense: with reference
to empirical material, i.e. the interviews, we distinguish between narratives,
descriptions and argumentations of the interviewed subjects in the sense of Fritz
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">Schütze
(1977</xref>
        , 1983) and Gerhard
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">Riemann (1986</xref>
        , 1986). That means, an interviewee’s
personal, biographical narrative – which can also be the collective narrative of a group of
interviewees who experienced certain events together – tells personal experiences of
the subjects. Usually they are told as one-time experiences, that is, they are referred to
as located in a particular time and place, relevant for one’s further biographical
development and having the quality of changing one’s own perception of the world. This
sometimes occurred in the group interviews but not in those passages that can best
serve to illustrate the processes of intergenerational transmission, which is why they
were not presented here. In contrast, when we speak for example of national
narratives or master narratives
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(Hammack 2011)</xref>
        , we don’t speak about personal experience
per se, but how personal experience is framed within the collective narrative with
which one identifies. We touch upon collective memory on a higher level – that of an
imagined community
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Anderson 1983)</xref>
        instead of the memory of a group that is based
on personal relations.
10 This statement was not in reaction to an explicit question by the interviewer but
occurred in the course of his monologue.

12 Therefore, the dabka group can indeed be seen as a potential space of adolescence
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(King 2002)</xref>
        that conditionally allows for individuation, in the sense of the reflexive
development of an individual life project through the experimentation with new roles and
the active quest for experiences in new environments.
