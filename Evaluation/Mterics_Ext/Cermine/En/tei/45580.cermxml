        <p>»Gleichberechtigung unter Tieren und religiöse Schlachtung«. Current laws on the treatment of animals in all liberal countries demand that animals be stunned before being slaughtered in order to prevent their suffering. This is derived from a widely-shared concern for animal welfare. However, in many Western countries, exemptions from this legal requirement have been granted to Jewish and Muslim communities so that they can continue to perform ritual slaughter. Hence, there seems to be a clash between the right to religious freedom and the duty to minimize animal suffering during slaughter. In this paper, I want to propose a solution to this seemingly irreconcilable clash. To understand whether these two principles are really incompatible, we need to establish exactly what they demand of us. I argue that there is no convincing reason to take the suffering involved in the killing of animals more seriously than the suffering experienced by animals during their lives (on farms). If so, we might demand that ritually slaughtered animals be “compensated” for their experiencing a more painful death by raising these animals in better conditions than others.</p>

      <p>Jewish ritual methods of slaughter are considered unacceptable by a number of
groups concerned with the suffering of animals. Indeed, ritual methods of
slaughtering require that animals be slaughtered without having been stunned,
thus causing significant pain during their slaughter.3</p>
      <p>On the one hand, ritual slaughter seems to be unacceptable not only to those
concerned with animal rights, who reject any kind of killing of animals, but
also to those with more moderate worries for the welfare of animals, who might
allow the killing of animals but are concerned with their suffering. On the other
hand, ritual slaughter seems to be justified insofar as it is an expression of the
right to freedom of religion. Hence, there seems to be a clash between the right
to religious freedom and the widespread concern for animal welfare.</p>
      <p>In this paper I propose a conditional solution to this clash between values.
Before presenting my argument, I want to emphasize that I will not argue for
the overall admissibility of ritual slaughter. My claim will be more limited: I
will try to see whether ritual slaughter can be made compatible with a general
concern for animal welfare. In a sense my claim will rest within the boundaries
of non-ideal theory, because I will accept most of the current rules and
practices surrounding the relation between humans and animals. In other words, I will
propose an improvement of the current system of raising animals that does not
challenge its justification.</p>
      <p>To do this, I will start from the uncontroversial assumption that qua general
principles both the right to freedom of religion and the concern for animal
welfare are sound and justified. I will also assume that neither animal welfare
nor religious freedom have priority; rather, I will assume that they are on an
equal footing. This does not mean that I am subscribing to a form of
metaethical pluralism. I will simply take their clash at face value. To argue for the
priority of one over the other we would need a complete and substantive theory of
justice. In this paper my aim is obviously much more modest. Indeed I will
only discuss whether they can be made compatible without arguing for the
priority of one over the other.</p>
      <p>To understand whether they can be made compatible in the case of ritual
slaughter we need to establish what exactly they demand of us. In the light of
this, I will argue that there is no convincing reason to consider the suffering
involved in the killing of animals more important than other types of suffering
they face during their lives (on farms). If so, to make ritual slaughter
compatible, at least in principle, with concerns for animal welfare, I will argue that we
might demand that ritually slaughtered animals be “compensated” for their</p>

      <title>3 Although some people claim that, if the slaughter is performed appropriately, the suffering</title>

more painful death. Such compensation might be made by raising these animals
in better conditions than those who will be stunned before slaughter. I will
conclude by defending this proposal against some standard objections and
argue it is only convincing if ritual slaughter is really essential to the

        <title>A Clash of Values?</title>
        <p>The case of ritual slaughter seems to involve a clash between concerns about
animal welfare and those about religious freedom. The right to freedom of
religion is undoubtedly one of the fundamental liberal rights. Respecting this
right does not consist of the mere protection of a person’s inner sphere of belief
and faith. Rather, it includes a number of more specific rights, such as the right
to gather and pray in public. Among these rights we can include the right to eat
and follow the dietary prescriptions of one’s religion. Accordingly, ritual
slaughter is an expression of this general right. But there seems to be a case for
its limitation. Religious freedom is thought to be inviolable to the extent that its
exercise does not infringe upon other rights and the fundamental interests of
others. One might say that ritual slaughter is wrong precisely because it
infringes upon the rights of animals. However, it is not clear whether animals
hold rights. The least we can say is that this is a controversial claim and there is
a deep disagreement about this issue.4 Irrespective of whether animals hold
rights, however, most Western legislation displays a concern for animal welfare
that seems to be related to duties on the part of human beings. However, it is
not clear what justification might ground such a concern. Is it couched on a
rights-based view or on utilitarian grounds?</p>
        <p>
          On the one hand, it certainly cannot be defended on a standard rights-based
view, because current rights-based views do not only demand that we take
animal welfare and suffering into account; they also argue that animals have an
inviolable right to life. On the other hand, one might think that an interest in
animal welfare and suffering is typically utilitarian. However, we might ask
whether such a utilitarian view should be applied only to animals or also in other
domains. But, since utilitarianism is an all-encompassing and monist theory, it
cannot only be applied to one domain (viz. animals) and not to other relevantly
similar domains (namely all sentient beings including human beings). In a word,
the principle that
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Nozick (1974</xref>
          , 41) called “utilitarianism for animals,
Kantianism for people” cannot be squared with utilitarian monism. Justifying this
discrimination is not only at odds with utilitarian monism but also with the

ment to anti-speciesism held by many utilitarians. Thus, if we want a utilitarian
justification of the treatment of animals, we must also be prepared to accept a
utilitarian justification in other fields of public ethics. But this would be quite
unpalatable for many of us. Thus, although certain types of utilitarianism could
endorse the idea that we have duties towards animals, this would be at the price
of an endorsement of overall utilitarian principles, which would also require
significant changes to current laws and principles. Given the non-ideal
premises of this paper, the thorough utilitarian option seems unfeasible.
      </p>
      <p>There may be other contending moral theories, but it is not clear which
grounds the current protection of animal welfare. In general, approaches to the
protection of animal welfare can be indirect and direct. An indirect approach
would justify concern for animal welfare through a duty to respect human
attitudes, beliefs, or commitment towards animals. In indirect approaches animals
are beneficiaries of certain kinds of treatment, but human beings are the
addressees of the direct obligations as well as the bearers of moral status. For
instance, some Italian laws concerning the prohibition of killing of and cruelty
to animals (articles 544-bis to 544-sexies of the Penal Code) are grouped in a
chapter devoted to the “offences against human sensitivity towards animals.”5</p>
      <p>Direct approaches to the protection of animals, by contrast, ground duties
towards animals in the interests that animals have autonomously and
independently of human attitudes towards them. An example of this direct approach
can be found in the European Council Regulation on the protection of animals
at the time of killing (1099/2009 of 24 September 2009), which asserts that
“animal welfare is a Community value” (preamble 4). The scope of its
application is based not on our relation to animals but on “scientific evidence”
demonstrating that “vertebrate animals are sentient beings” (preamble 19).6</p>
      <p>However, it must be emphasized that there seems to be an ambiguity in
many current legal systems regarding whether the protection of animals is
grounded in direct or indirect duties towards animals.7 Diverse pieces of
legis5 However, there is no coherent application of the indirect approach because such articles, as
well as article 727, which prohibits keeping animals in conditions that are incompatible with
their nature and that cause great suffering, point also at a direct approach. The reference to
animals’ ethological nature and specific needs is interpreted in the jurisprudence as a clear
recognition of animals’ subjective interest and humans’ corresponding direct duties.
6 An even clearer example of the direct approach is the Swiss Federal Law (455, 16 December
2005). In art. 1 the law states that the safeguarding of animal dignity is the overall aim of
the law.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>7 One prominent case is the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz), which demands that animals be</title>
      <p>protected, as should nature, in virtue of the responsibility we have towards future
generations (article 20a). Despite the prominence given to animals in legislation at the
constitutional level, this seems to be an indirect approach in virtue of its being grounded in the
well-being of future generations of human beings. On the contrary, the law on animal
protection (Tierschutzgesetz, § 1) demands that human beings should be responsible for
anilation take different approaches or can be interpreted in both ways. Such an
ambiguity may be a legacy of past views that have not been amended, since a
full recognition of human direct duties towards animals would demand more
extensive (and unwanted) legal protection of animals. Hence, we cannot say
that all the relevant laws on animal welfare are based on a direct approach. On
the other hand, if we take the indirect approach seriously, it is difficult to
understand what good is protected by laws aiming at animal welfare. Is it only
human sensitivity towards animal suffering that is protected? That is possible.
However, this would make it difficult to argue that the suffering of animals
should be prevented even when no human being would be offended. After all,
our sensitivity is not likely to be affected by hidden slaughter houses that do
not expose animal suffering to the public.</p>
      <p>These are very intricate questions that cannot be settled here. In what
follows I will discuss only direct approaches toward the protection of animal
welfare.8 This does not mean that we should disregard the indirect elements,
and nor does it mean that the conclusion I will draw is not valid for an indirect
approach. It means, rather, that the kinds of reasons we will consider, unless
otherwise specified, will regard the duties – if any exist – that we have directly
towards animals, not the duties we have towards the attitudes and beliefs of
other human beings towards animals. After all, although legal systems and
cultural practices are not immune to inconsistencies and ambiguities, a direct
approach towards animal welfare seems capable of capturing the widespread
idea that causing unnecessary suffering to a sentient being is intrinsically
wrong. This is why adopting a perspective based on direct duties seems a
worthwhile enterprise. One may object that such a direct approach is too
minimal if it can permit the killing of animals. That may be true. However, as I
have said, here my aim is not to ask whether the principles underlying current
legislation on animals are the most convincing. I simply start there in order to
ask whether and how we may reconcile the duty to care for animals and the
right to religious freedom that allows ritual slaughter.</p>
      <p>
        As a preliminary remark, we should bear in mind that ritual slaughter was
originally intended to cause the quickest and least painful death to animals,
according to Jewish and Muslim traditions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Lerner and Rabello 2006/7)</xref>
        . Such a
belief should not be discarded as mere self-deceit, because this might have
been the case at the time of its origination, according to the scientific
mals qua “fellow creatures” (Mitgeschöpf). And this seems to point at a direct concern for
animals.

        . Although I think the indirect approach has the advantage of being
more clearly compatible with a number of admitted practices and with ritual slaughter in
particular, in this paper I assume that the account underlying current laws may be justified
as a set of direct duties. I cannot establish here which account is more convincing all things
considered.
knowledge and the tools available. The religious grounds of the practice may
have been that pain minimization was a way to respect the sacred nature of the
divine gift of creation.
      </p>
      <p>Hence, we may say that Jewish and Muslim religious traditions have also
been committed to the minimization of animal suffering, despite the fact that
their understanding of this requirement is based upon religious rather than
contemporary scientific ideas. This means that if we take this idea at face
value, as the grounding principle of the practice of ritual slaughter, there would,
strictly speaking, be no contradiction between religious freedom and animal
welfare – only a clash between two different understandings of the same
principle regarding animal welfare when it is applied to slaughter: one informed by
contemporary practices and science, and the other informed by traditional
religious techniques.9 This picture, which reinterprets a clash of values as a clash
of methods for reducing animal suffering, seems plausible. However, in the end,
the reason to consider the traditional practice of ritual slaughter so important is
that it seems to be at the core of Jewish and Muslim communities, touching upon
a fundamental part of these religions, namely eating10 in a way that is consistent
with one’s most important beliefs. Hence, the clash of values resurfaces again.
This qualification is important in order to prevent a further objection. If Jews and
Muslims should in principle eat only kosher and halal meat, whose production
seems to be at odds with other legal and moral requirements, why cannot we say
that Jews and Muslims ought to forsake meat eating and become vegetarian?
After all, this same choice is made by many people on moral grounds. If the
reasons for forbidding non-halal and non-kosher meat are so important, why
shouldn’t believers be willing and committed not to eating meat at all where it
does not comply with their religious requirements? This is a serious question
because we cannot take it for granted that any kind of practice that is typical of
a certain cultural and religious tradition is worthy, per se, of defense and
special treatment. I shall leave discussion of this issue to the final section. Here it
suffices to say that, whatever our response to the question of whether ritual
slaughter is fundamental to Jewish and Muslim traditions, we have another
reason for taking the practice of religious slaughter seriously. This is the
reasonable presumption that prohibiting halal and kosher meat would cause further
disadvantage to Muslims and Jews – two communities that have already
suffered extensive discrimination. Hence, we might say that whatever our position</p>

performed, the animal loses consciousness immediately. However, the factual validity of this
claim is at least doubtful and discussing it would lead us astray.

justified or not) for two communities that already face discrimination.

        <title>What Does a Concern for Animal Welfare Require of Us?</title>
        <p>
          This paper, in short, confronts the following question: What is so special about
slaughter? If we are really concerned with animal welfare, while still admitting
the permissibility of raising and killing animals for the sake of human
nourishment, why is the way in which they are killed so important? This is not to
underestimate the suffering involved in ritual slaughter. My point, rather, is to
argue that there seems to be a sort of hypocrisy or incoherent attitude regarding
animal suffering. If a concern for animal welfare requires the minimization of
suffering, why should this minimization of suffering specifically target the
killing of animals, rather than being more extensively applied to the whole life
of the raised animal? Anticipating a possible objection, one might say that
concern with animal suffering during slaughter is more feasible and realistic because
the alternative, namely providing better care during animals’ lives, would be too
costly. Cost is certainly a problem, in that more extensive care for animals during
their lives is certainly more costly than simply being concerned about their
suffering at the very end of their lives. The former would require us to ban industrial
farming, or at least to raise animals using different methods, leaving them with
more space to move, more possibilities for interaction with other animals, more
time to spend with their offspring, and so on. It seems clear that much more can
be done to promote the welfare of farmed animals. A number of recent studies
show that farmed animals suffer even when there is no direct evidence of this
suffering (as there is during slaughter)
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Aaltola 2012, 1-67)</xref>
          . However, if we
focus on the suffering involved in slaughter rather than in an animal’s life simply
on the basis of cost, the normative grounding of our argument is both weak and
unclear. The only plausible way to defend the current focus on animal suffering
during slaughter is to claim that suffering during slaughter is different from –
and/or not reducible to – other types of suffering. Such a difference would justify
giving priority to suffering during slaughter, rather than other forms of
suffering, and would ground the legal and moral obligation to stun animals. Let us
see what theories in animal ethics have to say about this issue.
        </p>
        <p>We could give priority to the suffering caused by slaughter either because
we consider it to be of greater magnitude or because we have independent
reasons to prevent this type of suffering. The former holds true only if we
subscribe to a position that explains why suffering during slaughter is more weighty
than countless other minor types of suffering. If we look at this from a broadly
consequentialist perspective, it seems difficult to justify, because it either
underestimates how much animals can suffer in industrial farming or overestimates
how seriously we ought to take the pain experienced by animals during the final</p>
        <p>HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 116
moments of their lives. Even if we do not subscribe to a thoroughly utilitarian
position, we can nevertheless frame the issue in terms of a measure of badness.
All sufferings derive from an aversive state or stimulus (pain, fear, anxiety,
discomfort) that should be assessed with respect to two fundamental
dimensions: intensity and duration.11 We may think that the suffering caused by
slaughter is far more intense than other kinds of suffering, but its duration is
certainly shorter than others, which are typically repeated many times. Unless
we take intensity more seriously than duration, which we have no obvious
reason to do, the two dimensions seem to be equally important in a
determination of the respective amount of suffering. Hence, the suffering involved in
slaughter should be weighted through these two dimensions in the same way as
other types of suffering. And if so, it seems hard to justify the idea that the
suffering involved in slaughter has any kind of priority over that involved in
other parts of an animal’s life.</p>
        <p>The alternative to placing more importance on the suffering caused by
slaughter is to see the types of activities involved in ritual slaughter (and in
other types of slaughter without stunning) as wrong in themselves, irrespective
of whether the suffering involved during slaughter is quantitatively greater than
that experienced in industrial farming. On this view, it is the very mode of
killing without stunning that gives us a reason to forbid such an action. This
can be done either by adopting a virtue-based account or a Kantian view. First,
on a virtue-based account, it is intrinsically wrong to kill an animal without
stunning it insofar as this is a form of cruelty, which is per se intrinsically wrong. But
this claim seems to bear the burden of proof in showing why ritual slaughter is
intrinsically wrong while standard slaughter is not. To prove that it is intrinsically
wrong, we should consider only the intrinsic features of the act of killing
irrespective of the type of consequences it involves. To do this, we have to show that
ritual killing is necessarily motivated by a vicious intention and/or that it
necessarily fosters vicious traits of character. But this seems particularly difficult to
show if we consider, as seen above, that ritual slaughter was introduced in the
beginning as a way of minimizing animal suffering. This means that the
standard religious motivation for ritual slaughter may not stem from a desire to be
cruel but rather from a desire to minimize animal suffering. Hence, there seems
to be no cruel motivation involved in, and a virtue-based account would have
no reason to reject the practice.</p>
        <p>
          The second way in which this perspective may be justified is the Kantian
view. As we know, according to
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Kant (1997)</xref>
          , causing unnecessary pain to
animals is wrong, not in virtue of their direct interest in not suffering, but
because cruel actions disrespect our humanity and are conducive to the
development of a cruel attitude towards other human beings. To assess this alternative,
11 As is well-known, the origin of this approach to measuring value (and disvalue) dates back
to Bentham (1996, ch. 4). For a more recent version see
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Rowan (2012</xref>
          , 210).
        </p>
        <p>HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 117
let us put aside the fact that we are considering only justifications for animal
welfare based on direct duties towards animals, and that this concern for the
development of wrongful and vicious attitudes seems at odds with the overall
legal principle that laws should be concerned with behaviors, not intentions.
First, the idea that (ritual) slaughtering is more conducive to developing vicious
attitudes and behaviors is factually dubious. If this were the case, one might
also argue that people who perform slaughter according to the ritual method or
witness such slaughter are more likely to be cruel towards other human beings.
But there does not seem to be any evidence supporting this claim. And the
burden of proof is borne by those who make it. Moreover, besides the dubious
factual reliability of this statement, it also has an unpalatable moral implication.
Indeed, it would amount to saying that in Jewish and Muslim communities
people are more likely to have cruel attitudes than in other religious
communities. But this claim is disrespectful, to say the least.</p>
        <p>
          There are other possible reasons for giving more weight to the suffering
involved in the killing of an animal rather than that experienced in the animal’s
life. Let us review them in brief. First, recall that in general animal rights views
cannot uphold this point because they wholeheartedly reject the idea that the
life of an animal is at human disposal
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref19 ref9">(Regan 1983; Francione 2008;
Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011)</xref>
          . An animal’s right to life forbids the kind of
principle we are discussing here.12
        </p>
        <p>
          A further possibility is to take a relational approach. Under the umbrella of
“relational approaches” I include diverse theories: feminist care-based
approaches
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref16">(Noddings 1984; Donovan 1999)</xref>
          , associative accounts
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Valentini
2014)</xref>
          , and pluralist positions
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref3">(Anderson 2004; Scruton 2000)</xref>
          . Needless to say
this is a very sketchy categorization. These theories differ in many relevant
respects, but for the purposes of this paper they can safely be discussed
together. Indeed, all these theories share the idea that, unlike utilitarianism and
animal rights theories, the moral treatment we owe to animals cannot be
established a priori only on the basis of a natural property that animals have (mere
sentience in utilitarianism, or the capacity of being the subject-of-a-life for
Regan). Indeed, the treatment we owe to animals depends on the type of
relations we have with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          These approaches do not provide a univocal normative response to our
problem. Some do not accept the killing of animals at all. Others hold that it is not
in principle wrong to kill animals provided that it is done in the proper way.13
However, it would seem odd to include among admissible methods, that is,
12 Perhaps it is not in principle impossible to outline a rights-based approach that does not
necessarily include a right to life. However, this possibility is not considered by current
proponents of standard rights-based views.
13 On this remark see
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">Donovan (1999)</xref>
          , who supports feminist vegetarianism, and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Paxton
George (1994</xref>
          ), who argues against this duty, also on feminist grounds.
        </p>
        <p>HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 118
among those that are more respectful of animal nature and the expression of
care towards them, those that involve more suffering. Moreover, caring more
for an animal’s death than for an animal’s life would be utterly inconsistent
with the ideas grounding care-based theories.</p>
        <p>Hence, upon reviewing consequentialist, virtue-based, Kantian, rights-based,
and care-based views, there seems to be no defensible argument for giving
priority to the suffering involved in slaughter rather than in the life of a raised
animal. The only remaining view that could justify giving priority to the
suffering involved in slaughter would have to prioritize the final condition of an
individual’s life, giving it a special if not fundamental significance, perhaps
because the very final moments in an individual life constitute the truth of
one’s life. However, this view is deeply suspicious because it seems to depend
on religious and theological presuppositions that are controversial in
themselves, and even more dubious when applied to animals. It seems more
plausible, in sum, to suppose that if we are concerned with the suffering of animals,
we ought to estimate their suffering based on magnitude and frequency through
the whole of a life, without giving priority to its end. After all, giving priority
to the moment of death seems unwarranted and even based upon an
anthropocentric bias. Accordingly, if we were to calculate the pains and sufferings in the
life of an animal that had been raised using standard methods on a typical
industrial farm, it would almost certainly turn out that the suffering and pain
induced would outweigh the pain and suffering caused by ritual slaughter.

      <sec id="sec-6-2">
        <title>Suffering, Stunning, and Non-Discrimination</title>
        <p>Building on this, I want to argue that there is a flaw both in legislation
prohibiting ritual slaughter and in that allowing it. First, prohibiting ritual slaughter
does not seem fully justified because, as seen, there is nothing special about the
pain inflicted during death in relation to the pain experienced by an animal
during its life. Second, allowing ritual slaughter might discriminate against
ritually slaughtered animals. This is so because both ritually slaughtered and
non-ritually slaughtered animals are raised in the same conditions (typically on
industrial farms), but the former experience the pain of ritual slaughter. While,
as seen, there is nothing special about this pain, the amount of suffering
involved tilts the balance of suffering in a way that is, quantitatively, unfair to
ritually slaughtered animals. Indeed, it seems fair to say that, whatever the
assessment of death to which one subscribes, ritually slaughtered animals
suffer more than non-ritually slaughtered animals. Hence, we seem to discriminate
against ritually slaughtered animals. And, if we ought to be concerned with the
suffering of animals because suffering is intrinsically wrong, and in virtue of
the fact that we have some direct duties to animals, this discriminatory
treatment is unjustified.</p>
        <p>HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 119</p>
        <p>At this point, we may wonder why we should be concerned with the principle
of non-discrimination between types of animals if we are ready to kill them.14
After all, non-discrimination might derive from the principle of equal treatment,
and theories that invoke the principle of equal treatment of animals, whether in
the form of equal status for individuals or the principle of equal consideration of
interests, would not allow the killing and exploitation of animals for the purpose
of human nourishment.15 Put this way, the idea of equality or non-discrimination
seems to be either misplaced or the kind of concern that should be taken into
account only after considering a more fundamental normative principle, that is,
respect for animal life and the minimization of animal suffering. Furthermore,
one may think that the broad welfarist position discussed here resembles
utilitarianism in certain respects. And, as we have seen, utilitarianism is not committed to
non-discrimination per se, unless it can be demonstrated to be conducive to a
greater aggregate well-being. Indeed, one may say that in a version of act
utilitarianism that is not committed to Singer’s inter-specific egalitarianism of interests,
my worry regarding non-discrimination would not be warranted. After all, on
such a view, discriminating against the interests of a class of human or
nonhuman individuals might in principle be justified if such discrimination would
bring about a better aggregate outcome for all.16 In sum, it is not clear that we can
justify the duty not to discriminate between types of animals if we do not accept a
proper form of egalitarianism for animals.</p>
        <p>
          While these objections are interesting, I submit that there are reasons for
taking the non-discrimination of animals seriously even from the welfarist
perspective discussed here. This can be proved without making reference to the
egalitarian principles embraced by some rights-based theories. The advantage
of this strategy is that the resulting argument will be more acceptable from a
number of perspectives, including those that are at odds with inter-specific
egalitarianism. To prove this, I will proceed, first, by advancing a positive argument in
favor of my proposal and, second, by calling the tenability of the alternative view
into question. In other words, I will first sketch the idea that a direct-duty
perspective implicitly commits us to the principle of non-discrimination. Second, I
will argue that the alternative, namely of discriminating between ritually and
nonritually slaughtered animals, has a bigger burden of proof and that the reasons
available to ground such a discrimination are unconvincing.

16 If so, however, it is not clear how such a non-egalitarian act utilitarianism could justify the
discriminatory treatment of ritually slaughtered animals with respect to non-ritually
slaughtered ones. Certainly, this measure is more beneficial to the non-ritually slaughtered
animals, but it would be preferable to benefit both categories provided that such equal
treatment is not disadvantageous in other respects. In sum, this discrimination is
suboptimal on utilitarian grounds.
        </p>
        <p>HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 120</p>
        <p>We should recall that here I am discussing views endorsing a direct
obligation toward animal welfare. There are diverse ways to ground an obligation
towards animal welfare. Whatever we think regarding the alleged animal right
to life, respect for animal welfare might be grounded in the idea that we ought
to respect animals’ sentience and natural dispositions. This holds true in
general, irrespective of whether we subscribe to a rights-based approach,
utilitarianism, feminism, or welfarism. As I stated at the beginning of this paper, I do
not defend any of these views. Instead, I am interested in understanding the
implications of a direct approach towards animal welfare for the issue of ritual
slaughter. I simply assume that any of these views could reasonably be
defended. What all of these views, and others, have in common is the idea that if we
owe a direct duty to an individual, that individual is supposed to have a feature
justifying our direct duties. In other words, the individual is recognized as
having an autonomous interest in not being harmed or in being benefited. This
obviously puts direct views in opposition to indirect views, according to which
– for instance, in the Kantian version – we ought not to cause unnecessary
suffering to a being because we ought to respect humanity (not “animality”).
This is to say that whatever theory we adopt in support of direct duties to
animals, by adopting a direct view we implicitly assume that the individuals to
whom we owe such duties have subjective interests that merit consideration in
their own right and not (only) in virtue of other kinds of considerations,
whether indirect or instrumental. In virtue of this feature of owing something to a
being that subjectively merits such a duty, it would be strange to assume that
other typical general meta-normative principles do not apply. If we assume, as
we do here, that we have direct duties towards animals and a responsibility to
maintain animal welfare, it would seem odd if we did not apply the principle of
non-discrimination toward the beings meriting our direct duties. The opposite
claim would certainly bear a bigger burden of proof. The burden is to explain
why we should treat some categories of animals differently.</p>
        <p>To justify such a discrimination, it is worth remarking that in direct views a
being is entitled to certain treatment in virtue of its intrinsic features, not in
virtue of the dispositions regarding animals that the person who is under that
duty possesses. As such, we must ask what distinguishes ritually slaughtered
animals from non-ritually slaughtered animals, and whether such a difference is
sufficient to justify this discrimination. The only reason for this discrimination
is that animals are slaughtered ritually to respect the religious identity of
Muslims and Jews. However, there are two considerations that weaken this point in
normative terms. First, we may say that what distinguishes ritually slaughtered
animals from non-ritually slaughtered animals is not an intrinsic feature of
those animals, because they are ritually slaughtered only in virtue of the
independent choice of a human being. There is no intrinsic and specific feature of
animals that individually or collectively determines the fact that they merit
such slaughter and that might provide a reason for grounding this
discrimina</p>
        <p>HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 121
tion. Second, the normative reason for this discrimination is respect for the
right to religious freedom of Jews and Muslims. However, what this right
demands of us is not to discriminate a category of animals with respect to another
category; rather, it simply demands that such a right be respected. That certain
animals are discriminated against because of this religious need is an
unfortunate, but by no means necessary, consequence of the fact that there are different
religious doctrines and techniques for slaughtering animals. This means that the
religious difference is not a reason to discriminate against a category of animals
when there are alternatives available (and we will see in the next section what
the alternative is), because Jewish and Muslim practices do not demand that
ritually slaughtered animals suffer more than other animals. On the contrary, as
we have seen, ritual slaughter was probably devised as a practice for
minimizing animal suffering according to the technological knowledge of the age in
which the practice was adopted.17</p>
        <p>Now we can respond to the non-egalitarian utilitarian objection raised
above. Although it is true that the welfarist approach I propose here would not
be vindicated by this form of utilitarianism, it is not clear in our case how such a
non-egalitarian act utilitarianism could justify the unequal treatment of ritually
slaughtered animals with respect to non-ritually slaughtered ones. Certainly, this
measure is more beneficial to the non-ritually slaughtered animals, but it would
be preferable to benefit both categories provided that the equal treatment is not
disadvantageous in other respects. And the only way to argue against this
nondiscrimination would be to point at the major costs incurred in granting better
treatment to ritually slaughtered animals. Although this is certainly a serious
argument, it is doubtful that even from this perspective the mere matter of costs
would outweigh the interests of ritually slaughtered animals in suffering less.</p>
        <p>Hence, in virtue of the implicit commitment to non-discrimination of the
direct view and the lack of justification for discrimination, there seems no reason
not to uphold the principle of non-discrimination when it comes to animals, at
least with respect to their overall welfare and suffering.</p>

        <title>Proposal</title>
        <p>To remedy the discrimination suffered by ritually slaughtered animals, one may
argue that we ought to abandon ritual slaughter altogether. This is one plausible
solution. But the more radical solution of banning the raising and killing of
17 The same holds true at the legal level. In other words, even if the argument I propose here
was not a morally conclusive argument, it would be strange in a legal sense to treat
rituallyand non-ritually slaughtered animals differently.</p>
        <p>HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 122
animals seems to result from the same premises. However, if we want to make
sense of current legislation and if we take the right to freedom of religious
expression seriously, perhaps we can devise another way out of this unsettling
situation.</p>
        <p>If we are concerned with animal welfare, but consider the killing of animals
acceptable, and if we want to respect the right to religious freedom, but are
worried about discriminating between ritually slaughtered and non-ritually
slaughtered animals, perhaps we could demand that the two categories of
animal are given equal prospects of sufficiently high well-being in terms of the
amount of pain suffered throughout their whole lives. This means that we either
forbid ritual slaughter – but hold independent reasons for admitting it –, or we
demand that ritually slaughtered animals be treated better during their lives than
those that are not ritually slaughtered, so as to compensate for the pain they suffer
at the point of death. How this compensation should be realized depends on some
technical issues and on the relative costs, which I cannot discuss here. Moreover,
it depends on an estimation of an animal’s prospects of suffering, which seem
very difficult to calculate individually and comparatively.18 Despite problems
with putting this idea into practice, doing so would certainly be feasible with
relatively minor changes to current methods of animal farming. To give an
example and a thumbnail criterion, it might be that ritually slaughtered animals
ought to be raised in larger pens or enjoy more freedom to roam.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, the justification of this proposal depends on the supposition
that ritual slaughter is a necessary component of religious freedom and that we
cannot simply tell Muslims and Jews not to eat meat. In other words, this
solution is acceptable only if ritual slaughter is necessary for the religious identity
of Jews and Muslims and if we are committed to an equal recognition of
religious identities. If this condition does not obtain, we may simply require
Muslims and Jews to abandon the practice of ritual slaughter.</p>
        <p>
          To meet this condition, it must be shown that religious identity and the
integrity of believers would be violated if ritual slaughter were banned. But this
claim has to be justified, because religiously informed practices, as well as
other cultural practices, can change, and it is notoriously difficult and
controversial to distinguish between features of a cultural tradition that are essential
to it and other features whose suppression or change would not endanger its
continuation. Here I cannot discuss whether ritual slaughter is necessary for the
integrity and existence of Jewish and Muslim communities. Suffice it to say
that Muslim and Jewish communities bear at least a minimal burden of proof to
demonstrate this, in virtue of the fact that some Muslim communities seem to

          , 93-6), pointing out the structural indeterminacy of such comparisons of utility
functions between humans and animals and among animals themselves, seem applicable here
and very convincing.

        <p>HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 123
accept the religious validity of the requirement to stun animals before
slaughter.19 This means that the overall permissibility of religious slaughter is subject
to an important condition, irrespective of whether we approve the idea of
compensating ritually slaughtered animals that I put forward. This conditional
qualification is important because it shows that the expression of religious
freedom needs to be balanced with other values too.</p>
        <p>If we apply the principle of non-discrimination to animals and we overcome
the unjustified assumption that the method of killing is more important than the
method of raising animals, many objections to ritual slaughter may be lessened
or put aside. This is particularly the case for Paula Casal’s argument rejecting
the admissibility of exemptions from the ban on cruelty to animals on the
grounds of cultural and religious practices. Casal’s starting assumption is as
follows:</p>
        <p>
          I shall avoid reliance on any extravagant assumptions concerning the moral
status of animals, nor shall I argue that animals have rights or that their suffering is
of equal moral importance to ours. […] I merely rely upon the modest
assumption, widely accepted by Western governments and citizens, that the existence of
anti-cruelty legislation is desirable. Such laws are not based on sectarian views,
but on the reasonable grounds that it is wrong to kill animals in painful ways
when alternative less painful methods are available, and that there are sound
moral reasons to enforce such a prohibition
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Casal 2003, 2)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, Casal contends that there is no sufficiently weighty or important
interest that is capable of justifying cruelty to animals, even a need to protect
certain cultural practices. I do not want to reject her substantive claim, which
might of course be true. In general, however, it seems to me that her argument
would be at least displaced, if not rebutted, if ritually slaughtered animals were
treated better than non-ritually slaughtered animals, thus being compensated for
the extra suffering involved during their slaughter. In this way, a standard
critique leveled against claims for cultural accommodation and differential
treatment would be neutralized. Indeed, one of the most troubling objections to
culturally-based differential treatment is that the beneficiaries of an exemption
or a special treatment seem to be advantaged with respect to those who are
compelled to abide by standard legal requirements.20 But, if animals suffering
more during slaughter are compensated, and no overall deviation from the
general concern for animal suffering is involved, the idea that ritual slaughter
entails a special treatment disappears. Thus, if ritually slaughtered animals are

not disadvantaged with respect to non-ritually slaughtered ones, there seems to
be no need for a special justification of ritual slaughtering, because allowing it
would not be an expression of cruelty.21</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-5">
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>To conclude, it is worth emphasizing that in this paper I have not defended
ritual slaughter in general. Its justification is deeply conditional on its necessity
for religious identities and on our commitment to the protection of religious
freedom. My aim in this paper, rather, was to show that it is possible to
reconcile a concern for animal welfare and the right to freedom of religious
expression by compensating the pain caused to ritually slaughtered animals with
better conditions during their lives. The advantage of this solution is that it
employs a principle of fairness towards animals as well as towards human
beings. It applies a principle of fairness to animals themselves because it
compensates the discrimination imposed by ritual slaughter. And it is also fair with
respect to human beings because it does not simply concede an exemption from
a general principle to two religious communities, but it also demands that they
treat the ritually slaughtered animals better, without asking them to change
their religious practice. Hence, such a solution seems to address the problems
faced by contemporary societies regarding the difficult accommodation of
minority claims in an environment of pluralistic values. This solution may
seem too biased, to some people, towards the status quo regarding the overall
treatment of animals, but it has the advantage of proposing a very feasible
improvement of the life of many animals.
21 Claiming this, however, does not imply that we should also accept other cultural practices
such as Santeria rituals or bullfights, which Casal mentions.</p>
