        <p>This article reports on a study of how Canadian academics use on-line technologies to deal with increasing demands and time pressures. The results suggest that, in struggling to manage conflicting organizational and temporal priorities, academics are adopting practices to manage these conflicts which adversely affect the quality and content of their teaching and research. Moreover, these changes in practice are integral to reconstituting the temporal and organizational order of universities so they can function as nodes in the wired global economy. Academics are urged to vigorously champion temporal practices which allow time for reflection and the 'deep presence' required for creative intellectual work.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        The ‘ivory tower’ has been breached. The university is no longer a refuge from
the hustle-bustle, a slow zone for reading and reflection, critical dialogue and
knowledge creation – to the extent that it ever was. Some research we have
carried out not only confirms what others have documented about academics’
increasingly stressed state, as Canadian universities have been restructured and
have become nodes in the wired knowledge economy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Kinman and Jones,
1998/2004)</xref>
        . It also develops the proposition posed by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Ylijoki and Mantyla
(2003)</xref>
        that the ‘conflicts in temporal perspectives’ (e.g. between ‘scheduled
time’ and ‘time-less’ creative time) ‘are closely linked’ to profound
organizational shifts in universities. These shifts have been associated with concepts
such as ‘value for money’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Cassin and Morgan, 1992)</xref>
        , ‘managerialism’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Newson, 1992)</xref>
        , ‘the knowledge industry’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Polster, 1998)</xref>
        , ‘academic
capitalism’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Slaughter and Leslie, 1997)</xref>
        , ‘the new public management,’ and the
transformation of relatively autonomous, self-governing academics into
‘managed professionals’ and ‘state-subsidized entrepreneurs’ conforming to the
‘fast-zone’ tempo of business and politics
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Pels, 2003)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Our research not only sheds a light on these linkages and how the changed
temporal and structural order of the university campus is accompanied by
significant changes in academics’ practices. It shows the impact this is having on
the quality of teaching and research. The research also reveals how academics are
themselves participating in these changes, thus helping to co-produce, through
changed temporal and organizational practices, a new ‘social in motion’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Thrift,
2004)</xref>
        and a different ‘metaphysics of being’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Adam, 2005)</xref>
        . Yet, having
identified their participation and agency, the research also explores the struggle many
academics seem to be engaged in over the conflicting temporal and
organizational priorities within the wired university environment, and some of the personal
initiatives they are taking in response. We end with some thoughts on negotiating
personal, organizational and public policies to support, and even renew, the
academic vocation and the university as an institution of public culture.
      </p>
      <p>The research involved a detailed survey of academics’ time and the quality of
their work life mapped against their use of new information technologies in a
context of significant shifts in universities’ funding arrangements. Follow-up
interviews probed some of the paradoxes and contradictions the survey results
uncovered – for example, that while most respondents felt better connected,
especially nationally and globally, many also felt more isolated; and while
considering themselves more productive, many also felt that they were becoming
less creative. The research has completed its pilot-project phase, with around 80
questionnaires completed and 20 follow-up interviews done. The results are rich
and compelling enough that we want to give them broad exposure here.</p>

      <title>The Social-organizational Context: Retrenching, Retro-fitting and</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Repositioning1</title>
      <p>Over the past two and a half decades, in response to successive shifts in
government funding policies, Canadian universities have significantly shifted from
being the public serving, collegially governed, nation-building institutions that
emerged during the post-Second World War period of expansion.2 They have
reinvented themselves as institutions more integrated with the global knowledge
economy. This reinvention has not happened all at once. It has not only been
cumulative. Each layer of adaptation and each new initiative has rested upon and
interwoven with others, with mutually reinforcing effects.</p>
      <p>The retrenchment layer began around the mid-1970s, as federal and
provincial levels of government gradually reduced their funding for education, health
and social programmes. At first, universities responded to funding shortfalls as
short-term fiscal crises which had to be handled until things returned to
‘normal’. Over time, it became evident that ‘under-funding’ had become the
new reality.</p>
      <p>As fiscal pressures increased, so too internal tensions were exacerbated. The
task of controlling and overseeing the budget became a determining feature of
university decision making. Correspondingly, the role and tasks of
‘management’ began to occupy the institutional centre while the role of collegial
governance through academic bodies such as faculty councils and senates became
increasingly marginalized.3</p>
      <p>In the early 1980s, a powerful idea began to infuse higher education policy
that for universities to survive fiscal retrenchment, they needed to reposition
themselves to secure new sources of funding. Organizations such as the newly
founded Corporate-Higher Education Forum, the Canadian Manufacturers
Association and the (now defunct) Science Council of Canada argued that
mutually beneficial partnerships between universities and private sector
corporations would rescue universities from their funding woes while enabling
Canadian corporations greater access to cutting-edge science to advance their
competitive position in the globalizing economy. In response, Canadian
universities began to orient their programmatic objectives toward the economic and
political priorities of external agents who could provide additional, albeit
marginal, sources of funding.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s, a range of changes in
universities’ institutional practices ‘retro-fitted’ them for their new and expanding role
in promoting economic innovation and competitiveness. On the one hand, the
expanding managerially oriented apparatus of decision making and university–
corporate linking arrangements reinforced each other and wove together. As
government funding became less reliable, universities needed to exist within
new and constantly fluctuating budgetary configurations. For this, universities
developed an extensive tool-kit of performance-based measures and systems
for monitoring and supervising the activities of academics individually and
collectively. Cost-efficiency, productivity and accountability to real or putative
external paymasters in terms of quantifiable, business-like ‘deliverables’
became the predominant criteria for assessing and making decisions about
‘worthwhile’ expenditures of money, time and energy. On the other hand,
universities needed to develop tools for attracting and managing contractual
partnerships with corporate clients. For this, mission statements, strategic plans,
and advertising campaigns became the institutional instruments for shaping and
representing their research and teaching priorities as attuned to the needs and
objectives of these potential funders. By the mid-1990s, universities had made
the necessary cultural shifts and developed the institutional capacity to function
as more permeable, multi-purpose, and networked knowledge businesses.4</p>
      <p>Since 1996, the federal government has infused a massive jolt of research
funding through the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the Canada Research
Chairs programmes – $4.5 billion – into these newly emerging ‘knowledge
businesses’ in ways that push them further down a market-focused path.5
Threequarters of this funding must secure 60 per cent matched funding from research
partners who, more often than not, are private sector corporations. Added to this,
in 2002 the presidents of Canada’s universities signed an agreement with
government committing their universities and researchers to doubling their research
productivity and tripling their commercialization performance by 2010.</p>
      <p>Finally, the substantial restructuring that has occurred in Canadian
universities since the 1980s has been significantly enabled by information and
communications technologies (ICTs). These have been a key element in ‘retro-fitting’
universities to function as externally guided, strategically minded,
productiondriven knowledge businesses. As our research confirms, these technologies
range from specific tools, such as instructional software, listservs and
chatdiscussion groups for students, to an Internet-connected networked environment
allowing global collaboration among academics and new non-academic
partners, web-based teaching and administration and comprehensive data collection
to serve both on-campus and off-campus reporting requirements. It is not
surprising that the increasingly networked, boundary-crossing university would so
rapidly embrace these technologies as essential ‘tools of the trade’ for doing
academic work. It also makes sense that, in keeping with prevailing policy
rhetoric, many advocates of technology-mediated teaching, global connectivity
and ‘the wired campus’ have promoted the turn to technology, not only as the
‘cutting edge’ of higher education in a fast-paced globalizing world but also
as an efficient way of responding to the many opportunities and demands that
confront universities and their faculty.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>The Findings</title>
      <p>Our research not only confirmed academics’ widespread use of the ICTs in
everything from research, preparing and teaching classes, to administration
(largely self-serve now since the cutbacks in support staff) and communicating
with students, friends and colleagues locally and internationally.6 Academics
seem to have adapted to the medium to the point that it is fast becoming a
comfort zone, though fraught with anxiety and contradictions.</p>
      <p>Clearly, they like many things about the new university environment. It’s
increasing the exposure of their work, especially to national and international
colleagues (nearly 60% reported this, the women more so than men). It’s
increased their collaborative projects not just a little but a lot.7 They also feel that
it’s made them more productive (55% of women and 42% of men reported this).
And it’s increased their connections with students, colleagues and friends,
seemingly without jeopardizing their sense of being in touch with them; although
there’s ambivalence here and even a hint of contradiction. It’s also increased
their sense of being part of university decision making, though just as many
indicated that this had decreased. On the other hand, 51 per cent said that it had not
allowed them to have more control over their work schedule. Sixty per cent
(71% of the women, 50% of men) feel that it’s increased expectations of what
they can accomplish. Nearly 40 per cent (45% of the women, 31% of men)
reported feeling overwhelmed by the plethora of opportunities to which the new
environment exposed them. And 43 per cent (40% of women, 47% of men)
reported that it uses up their time solving technological problems.</p>
      <p>It is clear, then, that there are many things academics do not like about the
new environment. In the most decisive response in the questionnaire, 69 per cent
said that they do not thrive on the time pressures and fast pace of it (56% of
women indicated this, compared to 81% of the men). Not surprisingly, the
respondents reported many of the most common symptoms of stress, from sleep
deprivation (53% of women, compared to 42% of men) to new allergies or food
sensitivities (26% of women, compared to 6% of men), short-term memory loss
(45% of women compared to 25% of men) and problems concentrating (37% of
women compared to 19% of men). Interestingly, while the women also reported
more stress in personal relationships, from strained relations with family (26%
compared to 11% of men) to strained relations with colleagues (34% of women
compared to 19% of men), the men reported far more incidents of road rage and
its variants (22% of men, versus 5% of women).</p>
      <p>
        Stress is an important personal and public-health issue in itself, and deserves
urgent attention. However, echoing others’ speculations, we see it here as a
symptom of some fundamental contradictions involved in the pursuit of
efficiency through time compression
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Sabelis, 2002)</xref>
        . In particular, we explore this
through two related themes: first, academics’ ability to be present with
themselves and others and, second, their ability to be socially and intellectually
engaged in a way that will yield original knowledge, rather than a higher
publication rate.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Presence and engagement</title>
      <p>A number of contradictory findings led us to focus on this aspect of academics’
existence. For example, despite reporting enhanced connectivity and
collaboration with others, 34 per cent of our respondents reported feeling isolated (40%
of women compared to 22% of men). We specifically asked whether they ‘are
able to stay centred in yourself, to know what matters to you’ in a wired
environment where they are increasingly accountable to multiple outside and
corporate-linked actors and subject to their demands and pressures. The results
were equivocal. Thirty-four per cent said that this ability had decreased, 29 per
cent felt it had increased and 37 per cent said it hadn’t changed. On the other
hand, a startling 65 per cent reported that their ability to follow through on
informal, personal/professional commitments (possibly off line and off campus in the
community) had decreased. As well, 57 per cent said that they felt like they were
‘reacting, not acting on my own initiative’ on occasion, and another 19 per cent
said they felt this way frequently. Forty-five per cent reported feeling anxious
about keeping up with work demands and expectations frequently, and another
12 per cent reported feeling this way chronically. In a similar vein, 47 per cent
feel as though they’re fighting to keep control on occasion and another 20 per
cent feel that way frequently. Moreover, 58 per cent reported that their ability
to stay focused on their work had decreased, and 42 per cent reported that their
susceptibility to being distracted by all the information and communication
coming at them had increased.</p>
      <p>
        These findings suggest a significant degree of ‘temporal alienation,’ which
Ronald
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Purser (2002)</xref>
        defines as a ‘loss of situated presence in time’ (p. 163),
and which we interpret here to mean presence with others and to one’s self.
      </p>
      <p>A professor of organizational behaviour at one university reported having
‘fewer and fewer coffees with colleagues who are right in the building and . . .
[now] more short conversations with people I would never have contacted
before. So I’m trading one for the other.’ ‘Quantity for quality?’ she was asked.
‘Yes’, she said. ‘It is very superficial and there is no real depth of
communication, but if it weren’t for that there would be none.’ She went on to say that
she’s losing her political consciousness because ‘there’s no one to push me and
develop me . . . and say, that’s good as far as it goes, and have you thought about
. . .?’ As a result, she said, ‘I have less confidence in my own analysis . . . It’s
almost back to those pre-consciousness days. We are living in that isolation and
not having any validation.’</p>
      <p>A professor of English at another university misses the long, late-night phone
calls she used to have with close colleagues and friends now that everyone has
answering machines and communicates through email: ‘there’s the absence of
voice and all of the lateral thinking that goes on when you actually have a real
conversation, instead of just a focused interchange . . . the actual isolation from
people in a local community has increased enormously’.</p>
      <p>A professor of occupational therapy at yet another university echoed this
theme: ‘I feel very connected to people I don’t expect to see. But what I do find
is that people I expect to see, like my colleagues who are in the same building, I
may not see.’ When she does see them is at meetings. But then, ‘I find I’m often,
now, lately quiet in meetings, when I’m not by nature quiet. And I think part of
it is because I’m now with people who I only see at meetings! And so, it’s like
meeting quasi-strangers . . .’</p>
      <p>A professor of social work at the same university worried that as she and
others become habituated to email communication, a more superficial level of
social engagement can become the cultural norm: ‘It is a stilted dialogue.’ She
was asked, ‘does it move you away from spontaneity?’. ‘Yes, and that’s not all.
Sometimes we think with our mouths. But on the other hand, we’re so pressured
to give a response that we type up something and send it out because of the
pressure for a response, so that doesn’t improve it.’</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, a professor of film studies lamented that this pressure serves as
an alibi for non-presence: ‘It is easier if everyone is anonymous. It makes it
easier to refuse social interaction. It makes it easier to turn people into things
and to just not be creating a humanistic environment.’ This has particularly
acute implications for women, she thinks. ‘We women have always been
the embodied subject and technology seems to be erasing our presence in the
world . . . That’s how we exist – as an embodied subject. And I feel technology
is just damaging our sense of authenticity that way – authentic subjects who
interact.’</p>
      <p>A professor of engineering at yet another university likes how the ‘log-on
classroom’ allows shy students to at least start opening up. However, he also
quickly invites students to his office once they’ve broached something
substantial: ‘With email, you can’t read the person’s mode of thinking. So I say, let’s
have an appointment.’ Face to face, he continued, ‘I can see if they are
communicating with me, if they understand what I am saying, if the point is getting
across, if the problem or issue is worth elaborating more. I can’t see that through
email.’ Finally, he added, his racial and ethnic-minority status makes him
sensitive to being misunderstood. He feels free to be more fully himself when he’s
face to face, likes the freedom of being more spontaneous, he said.</p>
      <p>A professor of political science who tele-conferenced into committee
meetings for the years he was on a satellite campus ended up feeling that his
participation was largely a sham. He was staying ‘briefed’ he said, but not engaged
meaningfully in decision making. As colleagues told him when he returned to
the main campus, ‘you weren’t here; you weren’t around’.</p>
      <p>The themes of elided presence and of perceived loss of spontaneous,
sustained dialogue with people to whom you can be real warrant further study and
discussion in themselves. They also bear watching for what they predict about a
possible shift in academics’ sense of themselves and their work, a theme we
have framed as a possible shift from knowledge creation to knowledge
production, more narrowly focused on gathering data, processing information and
packaging it as knowledge, with more business-like, instrumental action
crowding out the time and pace that the mental and social habits of reflection and
critical dialogue require.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>Knowledge creation, or production?</title>
      <p>
        Academics’ ability to stay focused and their susceptibility to being distracted,
discussed earlier, clearly affect the ability to think critically and create original
knowledge. The survey also included questions probing intellectual
engagement. For example, an overwhelming majority (65% of both men and women)
reported that they are not reading as deeply and reflectively as they used to or as
they want to. Nor are they reading as broadly and inter-disciplinarily as they
used to or as they’d like to. Instead, they are scanning, mining sources for
selective bits of information. (‘I am reading for specific information . . .’). In response
to suggestive statements such as ‘I don’t have enough free chunks of time in
which to think’, 51 per cent indicated that they did not, reinforcing one of the
significant findings of an Icelandic study of academics, which documented a
loss of what they called ‘timeless time’ for research and reflection
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Ylijoke and
Mantyla, 2003)</xref>
        . As well, a significant minority (28%) identified with the phrase,
‘I can’t slow down enough to be in touch with myself and my innermost
thoughts’ and, in the same proportion, the statement ‘Everybody I know is too
busy to just talk’. As a kind of summing up, they were asked to consider Marcel
Proust’s lament for a quality of being in time that allowed for deep memory
association. Forty-one per cent said that their capacity for this level of
original/creative thinking had decreased, and fifteen per cent, that it had increased.
      </p>
      <p>Overall, we think that the findings on this theme reinforce Ida Sabelis’s
(2002) concerns about time compression: not just what gets left out, including
the time for reflection and dialogue, but also how difficult it is to decompress,
thus decreasing what she considers to be the most important aspect of
communication: ‘the expression and exchange of meaning’ (p. 93). The interview
comments flesh out these concerns, and their implications for the future of learning
and knowledge creation.</p>
      <p>A professor of English described sitting at her computer with several
windows open at once and simultaneously having new emails signalling on her
screen: ‘So you have all these things going on, and in my mind it is almost the
perfect match for attention deficit disorder . . . By the time you are a couple of
hours into your email you have lost it. You’re skimming, fragmenting . . .Your
life is so fragmented. All these emails are coming – “get back to me before my
meeting”.’</p>
      <p>The professor of occupational therapy quoted earlier described having been
involved in an international book project that was three years behind schedule:
‘We tried to do a lot of it by email, and sending our chapters to each other and
talking about it, but we didn’t put real fire into this book until I went over to
Australia for six weeks. So it’s a really interesting illustration, because email
made it possible for us to work together, but somehow it didn’t help us to get the
work done.’</p>
      <p>A professor of mathematics and statistics at yet another university
commented on how the fast-paced productivity push toward getting the next grant;
publishing the next paper drives out the time for creating a social space-time of
shared learning and knowing:</p>
      <p>We are becoming loners . . . We are creating in our offices . . . because we have
more access to information and we have tools to do things faster, but we are not
sharing with other people to become more sociable. That is the contradiction . . .
For example, it used to be they had a weekly seminar and every professor would
come and show what they were doing. Everyone commented. This has stopped.
There are no weekly seminars anymore because people have said that they don’t
have time . . . [But now, she finds] The big questions aren’t being asked anymore.</p>
      <p>I feel that we are giving students the wrong idea about what learning is. I think
the students are now coming to believe it’s just reading a lot, being familiar with a
lot of information, trying to get information somehow. We are not teaching them
to use that information, to process it and then to create something. I think that in
this sense, that is what they call passivity. If they are passive, they don’t create.
A biology professor at another university echoed this concern, worrying at how
much both how teachers teach and how students do their work has devolved into
‘modules’ that students alternately ingest or cut and paste into assignments. ‘But
learning isn’t about the details of what you are learning, I think. It is more
fundamental . . . The important point ultimately is just to get the students to
think. It doesn’t matter, it could be biology. Thinking about how biology works
as opposed to knowing little bits about biology.’</p>
      <p>The professor of engineering quoted earlier talked about how important
faceto-face dialogue is to convey to students that one is always creating knowledge
afresh, not just replicating it prescriptively. For example, he said, ‘how to deal
with a design problem on line. In many ways it is trial and error. Even defining
the problem, it isn’t really an absolute. We say the structure could be very rigid
or very flexible. We can solve the problem this way, or this way. You know what
I mean? . . . The problem is open-ended. If it is closed, innovation is
meaningless.’</p>

    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Interpreting the findings through the lens of temporality</title>
      <p>Clearly, the changes affecting universities through the combined effects of
retrenching, repositioning plus retro-fitting have included a radical change in
temporality. From the evidence of the survey and the follow-up interviews, this
change, while linked to the organizational structures and related routines of
universities, has resonated through the routines and rhythms of academics’ daily
life. To grasp its importance, particularly with a view to developing an agenda
for research and policy action, it’s useful to identify some of the particular ways
in which this cultural transformation is manifest, for instance through temporal
frameworks, through temporal-social practices and through the shaping power
of temporal rhythms.</p>
      <p>
        Dick
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Pels (2003)</xref>
        provides a useful overview of the shifting temporal
coordinates on which universities now run. In what he calls the ‘social triangle’ of
discourse in the public sphere, he locates the university in the ‘culture/science’
node (p. 21). He argues that its reputedly tempered pace traditionally had a
mitigating influence on the otherwise faster time frames and pace associated
with business and the market economy, occupying the second apex of his
triangle, and on politics/the state, occupying the third. Now, however, the macro
influences of globalization and the ‘fast’ subject positions of the new economy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref21">(Thrift, 2000b: 674)</xref>
        combined with ‘the imperatives of academic
entrepreneurship and self-generated funding’ – features of a repositioned and retro-fitted
academia – are breaking universities out of their own largely autonomous
temporal framework, and integrating them with the faster and more
presentminded ones associated with business and politics. As our research documented,
this is clearly happening, with ICT networks and their users playing a decisively
enabling role. Moreover, academics are adapting to the shorter time lines and
new ‘infrastructural routines’ associated with the wired campus, often willingly
and for their own self-interest.
      </p>

        Our research also sheds light on the changing temporal practices associated
with the networked, on-line campus. Not only is time compressed. It is
fragmented and then recombined as many-layered moments through multi-tasking.
As discussed, this has consequences, ranging from the suppression of
timeconsuming activities like reflection and memory
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Sabelis, 2002)</xref>
        to temporal
alienation. While
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Purser (2002)</xref>
        links this explicitly to a shifting temporality,
arguing that the loss of presence happens as people ‘embody’ and ‘obey’ the
mechanical or digital rhythms of clock time, Nigel
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Thrift (2004)</xref>
        perceptively
adds a layer of useful complexity by discussing how temporal practices are
diffused more broadly through organizational innovations like productivity
measures and the application of logistical reasoning to expediting the flow of
goods and information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instrumental rationality, of which logistical reasoning is a variation,
essentially ‘takes the world largely as given and attempts to find means of living ever
more productively and efficiently in it’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Hassan, 2003: 229)</xref>
        . It’s thinking
focused on the how of things rather than the why. It trades in data (givens) over
the more experience-based stuff of interpretation. While historical critiques of
instrumentalism, associated with the Frankfurt School for example, didn’t
speculate about the role of time
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Hassan, 2003)</xref>
        , we would argue that it runs on
clock time: not only an externally determined and regulated time, and a time of
isolated moments, of instrumental observation, of data analysis and so on, but a
time that can be optimized by standardized processes and speed-up, driven by
others. Its service to business and industry has been one of the hallmarks of
capitalism, epitomized in the phrase ‘time is money’. As it was then, in the days
of factory-like rational bureaucracies, so it likely will be now as global digital
networks embody instrumental reason in their systems and software, and extend
the efficiencies of particular managerially oriented innovations throughout
public life. ‘Results’ and ‘expected outcomes’ are achieved more quickly.
Performance and delivery are made faster, no matter what the ‘deliverables’
might be, be they student job placements or time-sensitive research reports.
      </p>
      <p>Our research yielded shifts in thinking, from interpretation toward
instrumental productivity. Our academic respondents have shifted a lot of their focus
to self-serve administration, fund raising, report writing and technology problem
solving, and their social interactions have shifted from spontaneous
conversations with local well-known colleagues to brief, focused, task-specific exchanges
with many near-strangers.</p>
      <p>If instrumental reasoning is the grammar of a new temporal systems order, the
bits and bytes of digital communication are its language. The relevant point here
is that it is a language of standardized abstractions delinked from the particulars
of place and people, their embodied experience, stories and memories. And
while it still takes time for people to key this language onto the screen, or click
and drag it from one file to another, the abstract immateriality of the medium
means that its scope for embodied presence is minimal and its capacity to invoke
the rhythms of dialogue, nil. Partly, this is due to another temporal aspect of the
wired university environment, namely that communication is instant.</p>
      <p>
        This is the novelty of ‘real time’, making digital networks hyper-efficient
from an instrumental point of view but potentially dangerous from a human and
cultural point of view. As Ronald
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Purser (2002)</xref>
        argues, in its deft collapse of
action and reaction through simultaneity, the real time on which digital networks
operate models a reality characterized by Hannah Arendt as the ‘means-ends
paradigm’ (p. 156). This view of what’s real is focused entirely on bringing
about the desired result. Purser argues that time of any duration longer than an
instant is immaterial, an obstacle to be removed. Yet the effect of this – what one
interview subject referred to simply as ‘the pressure to respond’ – is for people
to ‘fall back on learned routines and unconscious cognitive biases’, in short to
‘perform’. In Thrift’s (2000b) characterization of life in the globalized new
economy, where everything is a ‘blur of change’, a permanent state of
‘emergency bordering on chaos’ and every advantage ‘temporary’, the watchword is
‘performability’. This means, as the word suggests, performance to script and
specifications, delivering on prescribed deliverables and maximizing whatever
advantage is available now, now, now. For academics, this implies getting
grants, producing knowledge, and accumulating publications, patents and other
results – not necessarily authentic original knowledge, oriented to the public
good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, this performabilty dynamic can be habit forming, and can
fundamentally shape the consciousness, or habitus,8 of all participants, including
academics. For example, nearly 30 per cent of our respondents affirmed, ‘I can’t
slow down enough to be in touch with my innermost thoughts’, displaying
Sabelis’s concerns about the inability of chronically time-compressed people to
decompress and, as
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Pels (2003)</xref>
        recommends, to generally ‘decelerate’ or
‘unhasten’. Academics, like others ‘repositioned’ as actors in a globally
networked world, can ‘become entrained to the rhythms of the dominant economic
order’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Purser, 2002: 157)</xref>
        and its quick-click, real-time beat.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s true to the point of being a truism that we are all rooted in the
‘rhythmicity of the cosmos, the seasons and the times of the body’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Sabelis, 2002: 11)</xref>
        .
Nonetheless, rhythms based on social convention have so eclipsed natural
rhythms, particularly in the ‘socially integrative role’ which rhythms play, that
many primal rhythms are residual to the point of being vestigial. Moreover, as
the staccato, now-this, now-this beat of real time augments the metronomic,
externally regulated beat of regulated and scheduled time and permeates the
social environment, there is a danger that the sense of rootedness in anything
embodied and physical will become that much weaker. Accordingly, the social
habits, the temporal practices and social rhythms associated with embodied
reflection, memory and dialogue may wither as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The academics we interviewed are wise, therefore, to ask what kind of
temporal and cultural practices they’re modelling to their students as they practise
the processing of information rather than its interpretation through dialogue, and
performance-to-specifications ways of thinking rather than open-ended
innovation. As Helga
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Nowotny (1994)</xref>
        notes, ‘new knowledge arises under changed
conditions of creation and in changed structures of organization’ (p. 87).
      </p>
      <p>The English professor quoted earlier commented on the cost-efficient shift
from face-to-face seminar discussions to electronic chat groups at her
centre-ofexcellence university:</p>
      <p>
        I worry about the computer and the screen and the absence of embodiment, [and]
that the people who are going to make it through the system and arrive at
decisionmaking places are people who have an absolute disdain for the human condition –
for the human body! Does one want people in policy making, making decisions
about one’s health . . . who are so immune to, or who need so little inter-human
action?
A professor of biology makes a point of keeping his office and lab doors open,
and frequenting the public spaces across the campus: ‘I think the students need
to see you as a real person, someone who is in a lab or coffee room or in the halls
. . . Students need to realize that academia is a part of society. It is part of what
our lives are about,’ he said. In short, it seems that he’s modelling what Barbara
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Adam (1995)</xref>
        calls being ‘an implicated participant’ in the world (p. 141). In
turn, by getting students talking, and having some continuity with them from
one course to another, he says, they get ‘a sense that they matter . . . By [my]
being interested in what they have to say, being interested in their ideas, they ask
questions, even if they are afraid they are what they call “stupid questions”.’
      </p>
      <p>The professor of engineering at the same university quoted earlier also takes
time to meet and talk with students. He does this to model being open-ended in
one’s thinking as an engineer. ‘Doubt,’ he said, ‘you can’t make that electronic.’</p>
      <p>A professor of film studies at the University of Regina talked about the
importance of modelling speaking with one’s own particular voice as a way of
encouraging students to find their own. ‘The way the new generation goes about doing
research, with absolutely no depth,’ she said. ‘The kind of things they will
search out on the internet – switching from this to that. But there’s just no depth
to their sense of what you do with all this material. How do you focus?’ And
so she tells students to come see her, where she helps them find that focus by
getting them talking and, by listening to them stumbling to express themselves,
helping them realize that ‘what you have to say is important’.</p>

      <title>Conclusion: Implications for Research and Policy</title>
      <p>
        Perhaps the biggest lesson to be drawn from our analysis of the changed
temporality of academics and their work is the importance of time to understanding/
analysing organizational and social change. Not only is the body a ‘bio-political
terrain’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref21">(Thrift 2000a: 46)</xref>
        , but so also are organizations like universities, and the
social environment in general, including the one in which research and policy
debates take place. They are landscapes and timescapes rooted in bodies that
remember and experience life through all their senses.
      </p>
      <p>A second lesson is that the medium is the message. If the goal of the
university in a democratic society is to affirm the importance of critical thinking,
dialogue and original knowledge creation in academics and their students, then
the debate about the changes in universities and academic work which we
have described, and decision making on appropriate policy responses, must be
broadly, democratically participatory, with all that this implies in temporal
terms. As the interview comments suggest, academics who had chosen or gone
along with on-line communication for practically everything are now choosing
to set limits and, in returning to sustained face-to-face communication in, for
example, brainstorming with students, are rediscovering the benefits of that
attuned in-depth engagement. We might anticipate, therefore, that in an
inclusive debate about the changing university environment, as academics and
administrators take the time for face-to-face dialogue, they might more
vigorously champion measures to uphold these temporal practices in organizational
policy. Equally, as academics, personally and collectively, take the necessary
steps to restore presence deep enough for reflective dialogue, they might
discover a refreshed originality in their own work, which would inspire more
people to read and talk about it.</p>

        Notes
1. An expanded discussion of this material can be found in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">Newson (2005</xref>
        , 1998).
2. In the 1950s and 1960s, federal and provincial governments in Canada committed
increasing levels of funding to expanding existing and new universities to serve two
primary objectives: developing a highly skilled labour force to aid Canada’s economic
development and educating citizens to fulfil their democratic role in society.
3. George
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Keller’s book, Academic Strategy (1984</xref>
        ), was an influential intervention
during this period, advocating a shift in universities from ‘administration’ to
‘management’. Keller described the advantages of ‘management’ as being more assertive,
fast acting, strategically oriented and externally focused than traditional university
administration which took direction from the internal considerations and priorities of
collegial bodies.
4. Claire Polster (University of Regina) coined this term.
5. Claire
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Polster (2002)</xref>
        has written the definitive analysis of the CFI and CRC
programmes and their implications for Canadian higher education.
6. And again, using individual tools such as email and listservs, web-based searches and
course postings, but habitual use of the Internet-connected wired university
environment for daily administrative routines to collaborative research and other projects with
academic and non-academic partners around the country and around the world.
7. Here as elsewhere, there was a significant gender difference, with 37 per cent of
women reporting ‘a lot’ compared to 22 per cent of the men. Generally, women’s
responses showed some of the most dramatic extremes, both embracing new benefits
through ICTs and sensing the contradictions more acutely. See
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Menzies and Newson
(2005)</xref>
        for a more extensive gender analysis.
8. Drawing on both Bourdieu’s original coining of the concept and Christopher
Gosden’s (1979) modification of it, we consider habitus to be a fluid habitat for
the mind and consciousness, a sort of ‘sedimentation of past practice in the human
organism so that it unconsciously guides future practice’
