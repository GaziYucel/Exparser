        <p>Bureaucracy is the management apparatus of a state administration. Even in private sector, bureaucratic organization is very much essential for its smooth functioning and betterment. A legalized domination of bureaucracy only can ensure highest efficiency of an organization in a country. But the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh not developed legally from Pre-colonial period to post-colonial phase as well as an independent Bangladesh eventually. The state bureaucracy of Bangladesh is patrimonial in nature based on personal interests. The politicians and bureaucrats are interdependent in various manners for the fulfillment of their purpose illegally in Democratic Bangladesh. Simultaneously, the impact of militarism still exists in state bureaucracy of Bangladesh as it faced military rule in several times.</p>

      <title>1. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The extension of society is state. Sometimes Plato treats state as society. According to
Plato, state grows out of the nature of individual. Plato said, ‘‘the state is a natural institution,
natural because it reflects the structure of human nature. The origin of the state is a reflection
of man’s economic needs, for, says Plato, `a state comes into existence because no individual
is self-sufficing; we all have many needs.” (Stumpf: 1975). On the basis of knowledge and
nature of a society, Plato designed the ideal type of state considering three distinctive classes;
King Philosopher, Warrior and Producer. Unlike Plato, Aristotle did not create a blueprint
for an ideal state. But in his Politics, Aristotle says that, “it is evident that the State is a
creature of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal.” (Stumpf: 1975). Aristotle
viewed the state as the agency for enabling men to achieve their ultimate goals as human
being. Aristotle also sketched the different types of state nature; like Monarchy (one ruler),
Aristocracy (few rulers) and Polity (many). He observed three idiosyncratic classes in state;
Extreme Rich, Middle class and Extreme poor. His preference was middle class for governing
state to the holistic welfare.</p>
      <p>
        As an Enlightenment philosopher, Hobbs, Locke and Rousseau tried to observe state as
a new dimension. According to Hobbs state was uneven for the people in primary stage. He
argued that social contract to be needed for declining the inequality. According to Locke, the

uneven nature of state was the golden age of human society which becomes conflicting later.
For the resolution of such conflict, absence of common authority is essential, Locke argued.
For Rousseau, man is free by birth, but step by step they become chained by social
surrounding. In that situation, Rousseau expects the state interference to the freedom of
people. From the Marxist point of view, the state is a special organ that appears at a certain
moment in the historical evolution of mankind. It is born from the division of society into
classes and act as an instrument in the hands of the possessing class for the purpose of
maintaining the domination of this class over society.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Mandel: 2003)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        This domination causes class conflict in a society. According to Karl Marx, state is the
means of economic conflict but noting. Levine stated that the rise of state involved the
separation of the public and private spheres and the development of specialized political
institutions.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Levine: 1924)</xref>
        . Max Weber argued that sometimes political components control
over the economic elements in the state on the basis of authority. He characterized three ideal
types of legitimate authority by state nature; Rational Legitimacy, Traditional Legitimacy and
Charismatic Legitimacy.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Abraham &amp; Morgan: 1994)</xref>
        . According to Weber, modern state
based on legal authority which led to formation of governing body called bureaucracy.
Without bureaucracy state never run purposively, Weber argued. Our objective of the study is
to elucidate state nature according to bureaucratic characteristics on the basis of theoretical
understanding in post colonial period of Bangladesh. Weber’s explanation of bureaucracy and
its later discussion underpins the study for gaining our objectives.

    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>The Study of Weber’s Bureaucracy</title>
      <p>
        Historical context of Bureaucracy: Bureaucratic Theory was developed by a German
Sociologist and political economist Max Weber. According to him, bureaucracy is the most
efficient form of organization which has a well-defined line of authority. It has clear rules and
regulations which are strictly followed. Weber believed that a bureaucratic type of
organization began in societies whose political organization tended toward officialdom. As
described by Ken Morrision, Early examples of societies with large political administrations
include the Germanic and Mongolian empires, and feudal estates of the twelfth and thirteenth
century. Among these societies, Weber cited the cases of emperors and feudal lords who,
when making known their decrees and pronouncements, would appoint commissioners whose
power were exercised within the lord’s jurisdiction. Weber identified six basic types of
Bureaucratic structure:
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Morrision: 1998)</xref>
        –
1. States which tend to control policy and policing functions;
2. Ecclesiastical communities which are required to administer to large populations of
believers;
3. Economies whose main function is to distribute goods and coordinate functions;
4. The modern agency;
5. The military and
6. The judiciary
      </p>
      <p>
        Weber looked at the administration of early Egypt and Rome, at the administration of
Catholic Church, at Asiatic societies and at feudal economies of central Europe. While these
societies develop administrative staff and trained decision maker, they are in weber’s view,
formally pre-bureaucratic in their administration which restricts the development of
bureaucracy to modern society. According to Hellen Constas, Weber defined such kinds of
bureaucracy is patrimonial bureaucracy depends on charismatic or traditional authority
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Constas: 1958)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Mainly Max Weber talked about the bureaucracy based on legal or rational legitimacy
in modern industrial society. According to Weber, ‘Bureaucracy refers to an instrument that
has become indispensible for the rational attainment of the goals of any organization in
industrial society’.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Rao: 2000)</xref>
        . According to Weber, the term bureaucracy in terms of an
organization and management functions refers to the following six principles
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Miller: 2008)</xref>
        :
Management by rules: A bureaucracy follows a consistent set of rules that control the
functions of the organization. Management controls the lower levels of the organization's
hierarchy by applying established rules in a consistent and predictable manner.
Division of labor: Authority and responsibility are clearly defined and officially sanctioned.
Job descriptions are specified with responsibilities and line of authority. All employees have
thus clearly defined rules in a system of authority and subordination.
      </p>
      <p>Formal hierarchical structure: An organization is organized into a hierarchy of authority
and follows a clear chain of command. The hierarchical structure effectively delineates the
lines of authority and the subordination of the lower levels to the upper levels of the
hierarchical structure.</p>
      <p>Personnel hired on grounds of technical competence: Appointment to a position within the
organization is made on the grounds of technical competence. Work is assigned based on the
experience and competence of the individual.</p>
      <p>Managers are salaried officials: A manager is a salaried official and does own the
administered unit. All elements of a bureaucracy are defined with clearly defined roles and
responsibilities and are managed by trained and experienced specialists.</p>
      <p>Written documents: All decisions, rules and actions taken by the organization are formulated
and recorded in writing. Written documents ensure that there is continuity of the
organization’s policies and procedures.</p>
      <p>
        Max Weber was the first to give an elaborate account of the development of
bureaucracy as well as its causes and consequences. According to Weber, modern
officialdom functions in the specific manner. He attributed the following characteristics to
bureaucracy in his book ‘Economy and Society’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Weber: 1968)</xref>
        –
I. There is the principle of fixed and official jurisdictional areas, which are generally ordered
by rules, that is, by laws or administrative regulations.
      </p>
      <p>1. The regular activities required for the purposes of the bureaucratically governed
structure are distributed in a fixed way as official duties.
2. The authority to give the commands required for the discharge of these duties is
distributed in a stable way and is strictly delimited by rules concerning the coercive
means, physical, sacerdotal, or otherwise, which may be placed at the disposal of
officials.
3. Methodical provision is made for the regular and continuous fulfillment of these
duties and for the execution of the corresponding rights; only persons who have the
generally regulated qualifications to serve are employed.
In public and lawful government these three elements constitute 'bureaucratic authority.' In
private economic domination, they constitute bureaucratic 'management.' Bureaucracy, thus
understood, is fully developed in political and ecclesiastical communities only in the modern
state, and, in the private economy, only in the most advanced institutions of capitalism.
Permanent and public office authority, with fixed jurisdiction, is not the historical rule but
rather the exception. This is so even in large political structures such as those of the ancient
Orient, the Germanic and Mongolian empires of conquest, or of many feudal structures of
state. In all these cases, the ruler executes the most important measures through personal
trustees, table-companions, or court-servants. Their commissions and authority are not
precisely delimited and are temporarily called into being for each case.</p>
      <p>II. The principles of office hierarchy and of levels of graded authority mean a firmly ordered
system of super- and subordination in which there is a supervision of the lower offices by the
higher ones. Such a system offers the governed the possibility of appealing the decision of a
lower office to its higher authority, in a definitely regulated manner. With the full
development of the bureaucratic type, the office hierarchy is monocratically organized. The
principle of hierarchical office authority is found in all bureaucratic structures: in state and
ecclesiastical structures as well as in large party organizations and 'private' or private
enterprises. It does not matter for the character of bureaucracy whether its authority is called
'public.'
When the principle of jurisdictional 'competency' is fully carried through, hierarchical
subordination--at least in public office--does not mean that the 'higher' authority is simply
authorized to take over the business of the 'lower.' Indeed, the opposite is the rule. Once
established and having fulfilled its task, an office tends to continue in existence and be held
by another incumbent.</p>
      <p>III. The management of the modern office is based upon written documents ('the files'),
which are preserved in their original or draught form. There is, therefore, a staff of subaltern
officials and scribes of all sorts. The body of officials actively engaged in a 'public' office,
along with the respective apparatus of material implements and the files make up a 'bureau.'
In private enterprise, 'the bureau' is often called 'the office.'
In principle, the modern organization of the civil service separates the bureau from the
private domicile of the official, and, in general, bureaucracy segregates official activity as
something distinct from the sphere of private life. Public monies and equipment are divorced
from the private property of the official. This condition is everywhere the product of a long
development. Nowadays, it is found in public as well as in private enterprises; in the latter,
the principle extends even to the leading entrepreneur. In principle, the executive office is
separated from the household, business from private correspondence, and business assets
from private fortunes. The more consistently the modern type of business management has
been carried through the more are these separations the case. The beginnings of this process
are to be found as early as the middle Ages.</p>
      <p>IV. Office management, at least all specialized office management-- and such management is
distinctly modern--usually presupposes thorough and expert training. This increasingly holds
for the modern executive and employee of private enterprises, in the same manner as it holds
for the state official.</p>
      <p>V. When the office is fully developed, official activity demands the full working capacity of
the official, irrespective of the fact that his obligatory time in the bureau may be firmly
delimited. In the normal case, this is only the product of a long development, in the public as
well as in the private office. Formerly, in all cases, the normal state of affairs was reversed:
official business was discharged as a secondary activity.</p>
      <p>VI. The management of the office follows general rules, which are more or less stable, more
or less exhaustive, and which can be learned. Knowledge of these rules represents a special
technical learning which the officials possess. It involves jurisprudence, or administrative or
business management.</p>
      <p>The reduction of modern office management to rules is deeply embedded in its very nature.
The theory of modern public administration, for instance, assumes that the authority to order
certain matters by decree--which has been legally granted to public authorities--does not
entitle the bureau to regulate the matter by commands given for each case, but only to
regulate the matter abstractly. This stands in extreme contrast to the regulation of all
relationships through individual privileges and bestowals of favor, which is absolutely
dominant in patrimonialism, at least in so far as such relationships are not fixed by sacred
tradition.</p>

      <title>State Bureaucracy in Bangladesh perspective</title>
      <p>
        Hamza Alavi (1921-2003): There are very few theoretical contribution instituted on
the study of post-colonial state like Bangladesh. Alavi’s one of the most important works
entitled `The State in post-colonial societies: Pakistan and Bangladesh’ based on
interpretation of autonomous state in the third world. According to Anupam Sen, `His main
argument is as follows: in the colonial period the bureaucratic military state apparatus was
overdeveloped because it had to exercise domination over the native social classes. In the
post-colonial period too, Alavi Argues, the state has remain autonomous, because no single
class has succeeded in establishing its rule over the over-developed state.’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Sen: 2009)</xref>
        . In his
theoretical explanation, Alavi tried build up relationship between bureaucracy and other
social classes. He also revealed that bureaucracy act as an interwoven among the interest of
three social classes; Metropolitan Bourgeoisie, Indigenous Bourgeoisie and Upper class
based on land.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Alam: 2007)</xref>
        . The main arguments of his theory are as follows –
1. State bureaucracy is overdeveloped in post-colonial societies
2. Indigenous bourgeoisie are underdeveloped
3. State bureaucracy is autonomous.
      </p>
      <p>He also pointed out that the post-colonial state is surrounded and driven by powerful
bureaucratic military. This point is very much applicable to understand post-colonial state
nature of Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>
        Anupam Sen: He introduced bureaucratic interpretation in his PhD dissertation from
new-Marxist point of view. Dr. Sen tried to find out the limitation of Hamza Alavi’s
interpretation of Bureaucracy and state nature of post-colonial Bangladesh. According to Sen,
`It is true that, as he (Alavi) asserts, the classes in most third world countries are
underdeveloped. But it is not true; as he claims that the state apparatus was over –
development in the colonial period. In fact, in many independent but semi-colonized
countries – such as most Latin American countries and Nepal, Thailand, Afghanistan and Iran
for example – the state apparatus, the bureaucracy, the judiciary, etc., remain
underdeveloped.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Sen: 2009)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Dr. Sen stated that the social classes in most post-colonial third world societies have
failed to establish their hegemony over the state not because the state apparatus was over
developed by the colonial rulers, as Alavi argues, but because the state was stronger than the
social classes long before these societies were colonized.</p>
      <p>
        The state apparatus in most pre-colonial societies was patriarchal but superior vis-à-vis
the indigenous social classes. The colonial state apparatus, at least in the case of India 9 (as
well as Pakistan and Bangladesh), evolved from the patriarchal Moghul state which the
colonizing power inherited.’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Sen: 2009)</xref>
        . So, the main features of his theory regarding state
of Bangladesh are as follows –
1. State bureaucracy is stronger than the social classes now and long before these
societies were colonized that means the state apparatus (Bureaucracy) was
overdeveloped before colonial period
2. The state apparatus in most pre-colonial societies was patriarchal and the colonial
state apparatus evolved from the patriarchal Moghul state.
3. Historically the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh still bears its pre-colonial and
colonial roots.
      </p>
      <p>Emajuddin Ahmed: Another scholar, Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed discussed on
Bureaucratic Elites in Bangladesh on his PhD dissertation. Mainly his dissertation based on
the study to analyze the nature of the dominant bureaucratic elites in Bangladesh and the
development strategy they have been pursuing.</p>
      <p>
        He argues in his study that the ideal relationship between the general public and their
leaders, as these civil servants see it, does not differ very much from the colonial pattern.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Ahmed: 1980)</xref>
        . He also said the existing administrative structure and the institutional
framework were built long ago by the British in colonial India with a view to achieving their
limited ends, and these institutions served them well.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Ahmed: 1980)</xref>
        . By following the
arguments of Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed, the nature of Bureaucracy in Bangladesh would be –
1. The relationships among general public, their leaders and civil servants (Bureaucrats)
are colonial in nature.
2. The present Bureaucratic framework is similar as administration in colonial
      </p>
      <p>Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>A.T.M. Obaidullah: According to him, ‘Since Bangladesh does not have, as yet, a
composite and unified civil service law as in other countries, the various rules, regulations,
manuals, and circulars have the effect of law and government departments as obliged to
follow these rules in discharging their day to day administration.</p>
      <p>
        These various statutory and non-statutory rules provide detailed guidelines on
recruitment, promotion, and disciplinary action and employee welfare.’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Obaidullah:1999)</xref>
        . In
the question of promotion, he argues that In respect of promotion and career opportunities
discrimination on political consideration happens to be so conspicuous that denies the
fundamental rights guaranteed in the constitution.’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Obaidullah: 1999)</xref>
        . ‘After 21 years of
independence the promotion process of 654 officials to the various posts of Bangladesh
Secretariat in 1992 overtly manifested the authoritarian attitude and political bias of the
government in place of impartiality and objectivity, not tarnished the essence of merit
bureaucracy, but also projected disregard for all statutory or non-statutory rules of the civil
service, and sanctity of the constitution on the top.
      </p>
      <p>
        The civil service of Bangladesh as such is in real precarious conditions, amounts to a
spoil system, used in the hands of government for effectuating political purposes of the party
in power. If the civil servants are considered and treated merely as servants of the
government instead of the servants of the state/ republic, security guaranteed to them by law
may be jeopardized by capricious intervention of government with political motive’, he
exemplified.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Obaidullah: 1999)</xref>
        . In essence, he wanted to illustrate that –
1. Bangladesh has no rational bureaucracy as other countries have in a sense of legal
policy, rules and regulation.
      </p>
      <p>2. Absence of impartiality and objectivity in bureaucratic managements.</p>

    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>BANGLADESH</title>
      <p>The British established their rule in Bengal by defeating Mughol Empire in 1757. As
described by Willem Van Schendel, ‘On a fine June day in 1757 thousands of men were
fighting in a mango orchard close to the border of present-day Bangladesh. This battle
became famous as a turning-point in the history of South Asia. It took place in the small
village of Polashi, and the encounter established the British East India Company as the new
territorial overlord over Bengal. Within a century this trading conglomerate would capture
practically all of South Asia.</p>
      <p>
        Historians have often described the Battle of Polashi as the beginning of British
colonial rule in South Asia, a rule that would last till 1947’.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Willem: 2009)</xref>
        . And Bangladesh
became free containing constitutional law; secularism, socialism, democracy and nationalism
from Pakistani colony by Liberation War in 1971 after the partition of Indian sub-continent
into India and Pakistan in 1947. For handling British rule properly, they established an
administrative structure by following Mughol patriarchal bureaucracy which is remaining in
the characteristics of post-colonial bureaucracy of Bangladesh.
      </p>
      <p>Before the industrialization in Europe, British were driven by patrimonial bureaucracy
as mentioned by Max Weber. They introduced the same bureaucratic structure (as apparatus
of Plato’s ideal state) in Indian-subcontinent for ensuring proper taxation only.</p>
      <p>The authority of tax collection of Zamindar (Landlord) was given by the state, they
have no own authority to doing this. They were only the servants of state; state didn’t serve
them as western Landlord served by their state. That’s why, after feudalism, western
Bourgeoisie was able to emerged rational bureaucracy during industrialization. But it was not
happened in Indian sub-continent.</p>
      <p>Even in post-colonial Bangladesh, there is no any dominant class who can materialize
the state bureaucracy to establish their well-being. In that sense, the interpretations of state
bureaucracy in Bangladesh by Hamza Alavi and Anupam Sen are quite applicable;
Indigenous bourgeoisie are underdeveloped and state bureaucracy is autonomous as well as
state bureaucracy is stronger than the social classes now and long before these societies
were colonized.</p>
      <p>
        Maw Weber identified precise distinguishes between Patrimonial and Rational
Bureaucracy by observing Europe and Asian societies. Dr. Aupam Sen specified that
differentiation by following ways which can be presented in a table
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Sen: 1999)</xref>
        –

        <p>
          After the liberation war, in independent (post-colonial) Bangladesh, has a clear-cut
recruitment policy which is established for rationalizing bureaucracy on the basis of legal
authority. But what is the real scene exist in nature. It will be clear by understanding state and
bureaucratic nature in this country. In Democratic system in Bangladesh, Politicians claim for
power is based on popular mandate while that of bureaucrats on merit, competence and
political backing.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Anisuzzaman: 2012)</xref>
          . One the other hand, politician need to pursue for
getting nomination for election to the bureaucrats. According to Zafarullah, ‘Bureaucrats can
have considerable impact on governance because of their ability to mobilize political support
and to apply or deny their administrative skills and technical expertise’.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Zafarullah: 1992)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          He also added that it (Bureaucracy) is no longer the neutral instrument of policy
implementation in the hands of politicians.’
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Zafarullah: 1992)</xref>
          . But in western bureaucracy
still remains structurally subordinate to politics.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Ahmed: 2009)</xref>
          . In that context, the
theoretical explanation of Hamza Alavi is right; the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh is
autonomous. In the question of rational bureaucracy, P.K. Agrawal stated that any person
who enters the bureaucratic organization now wants to know what his authority is as regards
his domain of activities. Authority tends to power; power breeds ego; and ego creates
favoritism. …the ego may be different for different persons according to the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, ego though purely an internal factor gets liked with external factors
comprising family and kinship, caste and religion, language and region, social economic
strata….. this leads to inaction legalized in many way.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Agrawal: 1995)</xref>
          . But in Bangladesh,
persons enter into bureaucracy by pursuing others not on the basis on merit always. This is
defined the characteristics of nepotism in public administration in Bangladesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Jacoby, ‘He (Weber) considered official administrative activity as
separated from the private sphere of life, and as a condition which had developed over a long
period of time.’
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Jacoby: 1976)</xref>
          . But in Bangladesh, official administrations are not free from
private sphere of bureaucrat’s life. Still it is difficult for Bangladesh to keep out from such
kinds of patriarchy nature of Bureaucracy.

      <title>The common features of Bangladesh Bureaucracy</title>
      <p>
        In essence, the nature of Bureaucracy in Bangladesh shaped by irrational domination
historically. In independent Bangladesh, Politicization of Bureaucracy as well as corruption
in state bureaucracy emerged tremendously. According to Ishtiaq Jamil, `Bureaucracy in
Bangladesh is now caught in the tug-of-war between the major political parties, especially the
party and their allies in power. Their transfer and posting to suitable locations and positions,
their promotion, and career are now decided on the basis of their political loyalty. The
process of manipulating the career of bureaucrats has also led to the division among
bureaucrats along party lines. He also added that, ‘Political connections are now considered
vital for promotion, transfer, posting and even recruitment’.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Jamil: 2007)</xref>
        . In a recent study
on `State of bureaucracy in Bangladesh and its reform’, Shahidujjaman Khan elicited that the
bureaucracy in the country badly suffered due to politicization of the administration. He
found that promotions and transfers of the civil servants in the past were entirely on political
considerations and a large number of officers, having requisite qualifications, were deprived
of due promotions, which created a commotion in the civil administration.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also added that `Bureaucracy has, indeed, a sweeping dominance in the state
administration of Bangladesh. The neutrality of the bureaucracy is critically threatened
because of undue influence by the political leaders. Such situation contributes to the
unfairness and poor distribution of public service, which tends to boost the practices of
corruption, collusion and nepotism.’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Khan: 2012)</xref>
        . He finds out three kinds of problems with
Bangladesh's bureaucracy –
      </p>
      <p>First, as per Transparency International (TI) reports, Bangladesh is among the most
corrupt countries in the world. The performance of the bureaucracy in Bangladesh is
ranked the world's worst, along with those of India and Vietnam.</p>
      <p>Second, there are problems with the overlapping structure of bureaucracy, vague
divisions between government functions and citizen obligations, and unclear political
process of policy formulation.</p>
      <sec id="sec-7-1">
        <title>Third, there are problems with human resources quality.</title>
        <p>Khan clearly mentioned that `Bangladesh inherited the system of bureaucracy from the
British that ruled Indian subcontinent for over 200 years. The UK government has reformed
the bureaucracy by completely transforming its civil service, making it more accountable to
ordinary citizens. Some other countries went for drastic reform of their civil administration.
Since independence, Bangladesh has had at least 18 proposals for reform in the bureaucracy.
Unfortunately, none of these proposals was materialized.’ (Khan: 2012)</p>
        <p>By considering the theoretical explanation of Bureaucracy and above discussion, we
can summarize the features of state bureaucracy in Bangladesh in the given ways–</p>

      <title>4. CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>The state bureaucracy of Bangladesh is patriarchal in nature. But, there are some
outward characteristics manifested in its framework which is the expression of rationalizing
bureaucracy. In particular, documentation, accountability, recruitment policy, hierarchy and
division of labors of state bureaucracy of Bangladesh are legalized visibly. The skill of
bureaucrats in this state is questionable, where skilled managerial body was the precondition
of Weber’s ideal type of bureaucracy on the basis of legal authority.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the theoretical explanations of Hamza Alavi and Anupam Sen are
more applicable to understand the state nature and bureaucratic characteristics of Bangladesh.
Eventually, before and after independence, Bangladesh faced military rule in several times. It
caused the military influence in its bureaucratic organization.</p>
