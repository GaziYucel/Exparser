Abstract: The objective of the research is to identify the reality of integrating the dimensions of computerized health
information systems in Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex. The researchers used the questionnaire method to collect
data. The researchers used the random stratified sample method, where 30 samples were distributed to test the
internal consistency, structural validity and consistency of the questionnaire. After verifying the validity and
reliability of the questionnaire for the test, (220) questionnaires were distributed to the study community. A total of
197 responses were retrieved with a return rate equal to (89.5%).</p>
      <p>The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the averages of the sample of the
study on these areas and the domains combined due to the variables of (gender), (qualification), (place of work),
(years of service), (Job title). The results showed that there were statistically significant differences between the
mean of the sample of the study on these areas due to age for the benefit of those aged 40 years and over. The
results confirmed that there are statistically significant differences between the averages of the sample estimates of
the study on this field due to the nature of the work in favor of those whose nature is administrative. The results
showed that there are statistically significant differences between the average of the sample of the study sample on
these two fields due to the years of service in favor of those who have served for 10 years or more.
The study reached a number of recommendations including: The need to establish a specialized department of
computerized health information systems, with clear responsibilities, and includes technical and administrative
specialists and health personnel in the number and efficiency required, working as a team to implement mechanisms
of work in computerized health information systems and have direct contact with staff in clinics and divisions to
provide services and technical support as soon as possible with the best quality. Increase the support provided by
senior management to users by encouraging them to use computerized health information systems and
understanding their different needs. Interest in providing the material resources of the equipment and equipment
used in the computerized health information system. The need to use database systems in the administrative and
medical decisions in clinics and sections that have an impact in raising the effectiveness of decisions by improving
the quality.
1. INTRODUCTION</p>
      <p>Medical decisions face many challenges and difficulties because the volume of information and knowledge that
doctors and decision-makers in hospitals and health care centers must deal with on an ongoing basis has grown to a
point where it has become difficult to deal with them in purely traditional ways. Limits the intellectual capacity of
the human being and increases the analytical and predictive capabilities necessary in decision-making processes,
thereby increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of collection, storage, sorting and retrieval of information, and
raising the analytical capacity to evaluate and process information and alternatives Different times help to save time
and effort for making different decisions.</p>
      <p>
        Computerized health information systems have become a major issue of concern to all managers in health
organizations. Health information systems and technology have brought distances far beyond human reach, and have
enabled the storage of digital, text, audio and images. This helps to provide information that is very important to
decision-makers. Health information systems play an important role in the practical life of health workers. They
support them in identifying their training needs, continuing education and scientific research, Life, and the most
important applications of health information systems are hospital information management systems, telemedicine
and medical and administrative decision support systems

        The hospitals and specialized centers and health centers of the General Administration of Primary Care are the main
provider of health services to the public of patients and citizens. The General Directorate of Hospitals is responsible
for organizing the work of hospitals and monitoring the performance and providing the necessary means while
regulating the relationship with other departments in the Ministry of Health and parallel departments. The aim is to
integrate work among all hospitals, distribute competencies and manpower, and provide the service at a decent level
to all citizens by the most accessible means (www.moh.gov.ps).

9. COMPUTERIZED HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS
The World Health Organization (WHO) defined the computerized health information system as "the science of
acquiring, preserving, retrieving and applying biomedical knowledge and information to improve patient care,
education, research and management, as well as the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean" The use
of computing, networking and communication technology methodologies to support health-related areas such as
medicine, nursing and management (www.emro.who.int). This definition covers a wide range covering the
following areas: conservation, processing, retrieval and exchange of information Administrative and medical
decisions Support for administrative and medical decisions Save the radiological image analysis and clinical signs
electronically Provide scientific models and telemedicine, defined in the Scientific Encyclopedia of Information
Systems As information systems consisting of computer hardware, software, procedures and processes specifically
designed to collect, process, store and manage information related to health care delivery, in order to support
Medical Management

      <p>
        The health organizations exercise their functions in a specific organizational environment and within a framework or
organizational structure with its characteristics and specifications. Within this regulatory framework, medical,
therapeutic, preventive and various administrative aspects that serve the medical and health aspects Jad AL-Rab
(2009), Al-Dweik (2010) defined it as a set of elements, procedures and means that record, process, save, retrieve
and distribute information to support health care organizations where this information can be divided into health
information and management information. "Health information systems in the scientific encyclopedia are defined as
information systems Consisting of Computer hardware, software, procedures and processes specifically designed to
collect, process, store, and manage information related to health care delivery, to support medical and administrative
decisions

        . Wager et al. Sub-systems consist of information, processes, people,
and IT systems that interact with each other to support a health care organization.
Dimensions of computerized health information systems:
1. Types of health information systems used:
      </p>
      <p>A. Medical Information System (MIS)
Jad AL-Rab (2009), is an important subsystem that makes the overall system of the hospital a meaningful social and
human organization. Therefore, this system affects the overall performance of the hospital, without information that
is not made, and without information, there is no communication the author is not overly efficient. He says that
without information, there is no effective organization. The information is the clean blood flowing, which stimulates
the arteries and veins of multiple and interconnected organizations, and the importance of medical information
systems in raising the efficiency of medical and organizational performance in health organizations.</p>
      <p>
        B. Medical Records Information System and its benefits for health organizations:
The concept of JAD AL-Rab (2009) is a concept developed in the field of information systems in general and in the
area of health organization management in particular. It is defined as "one of the integrated information systems of
the hospital-wide integrated information system Data on the disease as well as on the units and departments
responsible for the provision of therapeutic and medical services in the hospital and then tabulation, operation,
treatment, storage and retrieval of the data to be used primarily in the decision-making and medical use for the
purposes of legal education and training and guidance of the Medical Authority and My research, medical and
administrative studies in health organizations.
2. Equipment and devices used:
The devices as defined by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref33 ref34 ref35">(Kundalji and Al-Janabi, 2009)</xref>
        include all the various types of physical components and
media used in the processes in which the data and information pass. The hardware or hardware does not include
computers and other devices, but also all the media and visible objects on which data are recorded Pages and pieces
of paper to extract information onto magnetic or optical disks.
3. The databases used
Al-Najjar (2005) stated that databases are a logical organization of clusters of interconnected files where data are
integrated and inter-related, making it easy to find information to achieve the desired objectives, and data are
arranged and stored in a typical way Data avoidance is avoided.
4. Networks:
The networks include long-range communications and communications technologies, and various types of networks,
such as the Internet, intranet, and extranets, which have become important in managing successful e-business and
business operations of all kinds, through its Kundalji and Al- Janabi, (2009). Local networks use cables of various
types, including dual-channel telephone wires, single or multichannel cable and high-performance fiber optics
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref18 ref21">(AlSalmi and Al-Salmi, 2005)</xref>
        .
5. Supporting senior management:
The effectiveness of the system depends on the support of the senior management of the organization served by the
system, whether at the level of data inputs or the level of its policy outputs and without support at the level of either
system does not lead
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Al-Moghrabi, 2002)</xref>
        6. Users of the system:
The availability of human skills and competencies, training, development and motivation is one of the most
important pillars for achieving the goals of the institution. Achieving success requires dedicating attention and care

10. FIELD STUDY
First- Methodology of the study:
In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the researchers used the descriptive analytical method in which he
tries to describe the phenomenon of the subject of the study, analyzing its data, the relationship between its
components and the opinions that are raised around it, the processes it contains and the effects it causes.
Second- Society and Study Sample:
The society of the study is defined as all the vocabulary of the phenomenon studied by the researchers. Based on the
problem of the study and its objectives, the target community consists of the departments and departments
responsible for the health information systems in the Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex- Gaza (289) administratively.
The sample was randomized to a sample of 30 samples to test the internal consistency, structural honesty and
stability of the questionnaire. After confirming the validity of the questionnaire, 220 samples were distributed to the
study population (89.5%).
      </p>
      <p>Third: The Study Tool:
The instrument of study means that the tool measures what has been set for its measurement. The veracity of the
questionnaire has been verified by the following methods:
1. Validity from the point of view of the arbitrators:
The questionnaire was presented to a number of specialized arbitrators in order to ascertain the accuracy of the
linguistic language of the questionnaire, the clarity of the instructions of the questionnaire, the affiliation of the
paragraphs to the dimensions of the questionnaire and the validity of this tool to measure the objectives associated
with this study. The arbitrators looked.
2. Internal Validity
The consistency of the internal consistency of each paragraph of the questionnaire with the area in which this
paragraph belongs is true. The researchers calculated the internal consistency of the questionnaire by calculating the
correlation coefficients between each paragraph of the question domains and the total score of the field itself.
Fourthly- Reliability of the study instrument Reliability:
The questionnaire is consistently meant to "give the questionnaire the same results if repeated several times.
The researchers investigated the stability using Alpha Cronbach's Coefficient equation. The researchers used the
Alpha Cronbach method to measure the stability of the questionnaire. The results were as shown in Table 1.</p>

      <p>All fields together
*Self-honesty = positive quadratic root of the Cronbach alpha factor
It is clear from the results shown in Table (1) that the value of the alpha-cronbach coefficient is high for each field,
ranging from (0.775, 0.949) to all the paragraphs of the questionnaire (0.960). As well as the value of self-honesty is
high for each field, ranging between (0.880.0.974) and reached all the paragraphs of the questionnaire (0.980) this
means that the coefficient of self-honesty is high.</p>
      <p>Statistical treatments used:
The questionnaire was dumped and analyzed through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).
Normality Distribution Test:
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (K-S) was used to test whether or not the data followed normal distribution and the
results were as shown in Table 2.</p>
      <p>Table 2: Demonstrates the results of the normal distribution test</p>

      <p>All fields together
It is clear from the results shown in Table (2) that the probability value (Sig) for the fields of study is greater than
the level of significance (α≤ 0.05). Thus, the distribution of data for these fields follows the natural distribution,
where the scientific tests will be used to answer the hypotheses of the study. The following statistical tools were

11. ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY AXES
And 35.0% of the study sample was under 30 years of age, 32.0% were aged 30-40 years and 22.3% were aged
4050 years, 10.7% (50 years) and more. The researchers attribute this to the diversity of the average age, which
indicates the availability of expertise. It is also noticed that 79.3% of the study population is less than (50) years old,
and this is because the Palestinian society is young and young.
(13.7%) have an average diploma, 60.9% have a bachelor's degree, 18.8% hold a master's degree, and 3.6% hold a
PhD degree, Where the researchers note from the previous results that (74.6%) of the society of the study of holders
of a bachelor's degree and diploma. The researchers attributed this to the fact that most jobs in Dar Al-Shifa require
a minimum diploma for administrative, medical and medical support, and a bachelor's degree for medical posts.
(33.0%) of the study respondents said that the nature of their work is administrative, while (67.0%) the nature of
their work is a health administration. The researchers attribute this to the fact that Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex is
the largest medical and health center in the Gaza Strip, Central, and drug stores, so it is normal that the majority of
the study group of health administrators.
(12.7%) of the study sample work in outpatient clinics, while 87.3% work in the departments. The researchers
attribute that the Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has the main sections that serve all the citizens of the Gaza Strip.
All hospitals in the Gaza Strip, primary care centers, specialized surgeons, and specialist care departments and
referral sections for patients who need clinical care. Outpatient clinics are for patients who complain of various
diseases in the Gaza Strip.
(27.9%) of the sample study years of service less than (5) years, (28.4%), the years of service ranging from (5) to
less than (10) years, while (43.7%) years of service (10). The researchers attributed this to the fact that the largest
percentage is for those with experience. The percentage of workers who have more than 5 years of employment is
72.1%. This is due to the stability of the labor force provided by the Ministry of Health to its employees. The staff of
the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which represents their safety compared to private clinics and civil centers.
And (7.1%) of the sample of the study named their job title department manager and above, (45.7%) head of
department, (7.6%) administrative head, while (39.6%) their administrative job title, And since the Dar Al-Shifaa
complex is a medical complex, it is natural that the owners of the administrative functions of the medical and health
personnel who hold managerial positions are more than the administrative staff.</p>
      <p>Analysis of question paragraphs:
To analyze the resolution paragraphs, a single sample T test was used to determine whether the average response
score had reached the intermediate approval level (3) or not.</p>
      <p>Zero Hypothesis: The mean response is equal to (3) and corresponds to the average degree of approval according to
the Likert scale.</p>
      <p>Alternative Hypothesis: The average response score is not equal to (3).</p>
      <p>If Sig &lt;0.05 (Sig is greater than 0.05), the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. In this case, the average of the
individuals' opinions on the phenomenon studied is not substantially different from the average degree of approval
(3). 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted that the average views of
individuals differ substantially from the average approval level (3). In this case, it is possible to determine whether
the average response substantially increases or decreases the degree of intermediate approval. By means of the value
of the test. If the value of the test is positive, it means that the arithmetic mean of the answer exceeds the degree of
intermediate approval and vice versa.</p>

* The arithmetic average is statistically significant at the level of significance (α= 0.05).</p>
        <p>From Table (5) we can draw the following:
- The arithmetic mean of the second paragraph "There is a 3.34 (total grade 5) in the Dar Al-Shifa Medical
Complex. The relative arithmetic mean is 66.77%, the test value is 4.59 and the probability value (Sig) is
0.000. Therefore, this paragraph is considered statistically significant at a level of significance (α= 0.05)
indicating that the average response rate for this paragraph has exceeded the average approval level of 3,
which means that there is considerable agreement by the respondents on this paragraph.
- The arithmetic mean of the ninth paragraph "Modern and highly efficient communication techniques"
equals 2.78, ie, the relative arithmetic average is 55.65%, the test value is -2.55, and the probability value
(Sig) is 0.006. Therefore, this paragraph is considered statistically significant at a level of significance (α=
0.05) indicating that the average response rate for this paragraph has fallen below the average approval
level of 3, which means that there is little agreement by the respondents on this paragraph.
- In general, the arithmetic average is equal to 3.04, the relative arithmetic average is 60.79%, the test value
is 0.80, and the probability value (Sig) is 0.212. Therefore, the field of "used equipment and equipment" is
not statistically significant at a level of significance (α= 0.05). The average response level for this field is
not significantly different from the average approval score of 3, which means that there is moderate
approval by the sample members in this field.</p>
        <p>The researchers attributed this to the availability of adequate number of modern computers suitable for the number
of staff and supported large storage areas and high speeds and provide the necessary protection to prevent cases of
vandalism In contrast, the network used in health centers of the problems of interruption and low speed sometimes,
despite the modernity and due to the enormous operations Which is at the same time.</p>

        <p>These results differed with some studies such as Abu Kareem (2013), which concluded that the devices are the most
information systems that improve the administrative performance, Al-Omari (2009), which reached a good level of
material requirements, -Saudi, 2006), which found the impact of the main requirements for the management and
operation of the physical, software, human and organizational computer information system in job performance, and
the study of Abu Sabt (2005) which concluded that the devices used in universities are modern and highly efficient.

* The arithmetic average is statistically significant at the level of significance (α= 0.05).</p>
        <p>From Table (6) we can draw the following:
- The computational average of the first paragraph "The software used with the devices used" corresponds to
3.44 (the total score of 5), ie, the relative arithmetic mean (68.80%), the test value 5.27, and the probability
value (Sig.) Equals 0.000. Thus this paragraph is statistically significant at a level of significance (α= 0.05),
indicating that the average response rate for this paragraph has exceeded the average approval level of 3
which means that there is a high degree of approval by the respondents to this paragraph.
- The mathematical average of the tenth paragraph "The instructions needed to run the programs that I need
to perform in action" equals 2.97, ie, the relative arithmetic mean is 59.48%, the test value is -0.29, and the
probability value (Sig) is 0.386. Therefore, this paragraph is not statistically significant at the level (α=
0.05), indicating that the average response rate for this paragraph is not substantially different from the
average approval level of 3, which means that there is a moderate approval by the respondents on this
paragraph.
- In general, the arithmetic average is 3.15, the relative arithmetic average is 62.97%, the test value is 3.04,
and the probability value (Sig) is 0.001. Therefore, the "used databases" field is statistically significant at
the level (α= 0.05), the degree of response to this area has exceeded the average approval level of 3, which
means that there is considerable agreement by the sample members on the paragraphs of this area.
The researchers attribute this to the availability of databases used by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, in addition
to providing the necessary instructions for running the programs.</p>
        <p>
          These results were agreed with Abu Kareem (2013), which concluded that the management and operation of the
databases is highly capable of adding and modifying, and that the management and operation of the databases are
highly capable of storage. Al-Halabi (2010)

AlShifa Medical Complex” equals 3.66 (the total score of 5), ie, the relative arithmetic average is 73.16%, the
test value is 7.26, and the probability value (Sig) is 0.000. Therefore, this paragraph is considered
statistically significant at a level of significance (α= 0.05) indicating that the average response rate for this
paragraph has exceeded the average approval level of 3, which means that there is considerable agreement
by the respondents on this paragraph.
- The arithmetic mean of the fourth paragraph "The computer network is maintained periodically" equals
2.90, ie, the relative arithmetic average is 57.96%, the test value is -1.32, and the probability value (Sig) is
equal to 0.095. Therefore, this paragraph is not statistically significant at the indication level (α= 0.05), the
average response rate for this paragraph is not substantially different from the average approval level of 3,
which means that there is a moderate approval by the respondents on this paragraph.
- In general, the arithmetic average is 3.19, the relative arithmetic average is 63.84%, the test value is 3.72,
and the probability value (Sig) is 0.000. Therefore, the "networks" field is statistically significant at the
level (α= 0.05) indicating this area has exceeded the degree of approval of the medium of 3, which means
that there is a high degree of approval by the respondents on the paragraphs of this area.</p>
        <p>
          The researchers attributed this to the existence of an internal computer network commensurate with the needs of the
work, and characterized by speed of communication, and is maintained periodically, and is characterized by
protection from penetration and tampering with information, and can be developed flexibly in terms of technical.

      <sec id="sec-2-7">
        <title>From Table (9) we can draw the following:</title>
        <p>- The arithmetic average of the first paragraph "the workers in existing systems have the ability to adapt to
business requirements" equals 3.48 (the total score of 5), i.e. the relative arithmetic average is 69.59%, the test
value is 5.66 and the probability value (Sig) is 0.000. Therefore, this paragraph is considered statistically
significant at a level of significance (α= 0.05) indicating that the average response rate for this paragraph has
exceeded the average approval level of 3, which means that there is considerable agreement by the sample
members on this paragraph.
- The computational average of the sixth paragraph "The computer systems section provides the same level of
services at all times" equals 2.92, ie, the relative arithmetic mean is 58.36%, the test value is -0.98 and the
probability value (Sig) is 0.163, so this is not statistically significant at the level of significance (α= 0.05)
indicating that the average response rate for this paragraph is not significantly different from the average
approval level of 3, which means that there is a moderate approval by the respondents on this paragraph.
- In general, the arithmetic mean is 3.12, the relative arithmetic average is 62.48%, the test value is 2.30, and the
probability value (Sig) is 0.011. Therefore, the "system users" field is statistically significant at a level of
significance (α= 0.05). This area differs substantially from the average approval level of 3, which means that
there is considerable agreement by the sample members on the paragraphs of this area.</p>
        <p>The researchers attributed this to the existence of the administration responsible for the computerized health system
at the Dar Al-Shifa Health Complex in Gaza, and the opinion of the members of the community that the workers in
the existing systems have the ability to adapt to the requirements of the work, Human cadres have the skills to
operate and maintain computerized information systems.</p>

          These results were agreed with some studies such as Abu Kareem (2013), which found that the response by the staff
in the systems is high, and the study

arithmetic average is 62.06%, the test value is 2.29, and the probability value (Sig) is 0.012. Therefore, the first axis
clauses are statistically significant Indicating that the average response rate has exceeded the average approval level,
which is 3. This means that there is a great deal of agreement by the sample members on the first axis in general.

more.
13. RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
        <p>The need to establish a specialized department of computerized health information systems, with clear
responsibilities, and includes technical and administrative specialists and health personnel, and the number and
efficiency required, working as a team work to apply the mechanisms of work computerized health information
systems, and be in direct contact with staff in clinics and sections to provide services and technical support as
soon as possible Best quality.</p>
        <p>Increased support from senior management to users by encouraging them to use computerized health
information systems and understanding their different needs.</p>

network, through the provision of a main server.</p>
        <p>Provide a special e-mail to each employee using the computerized health information system, which facilitates
the exchange of data between employees and increases communication with senior management.
The need for the users of the system to participate in the process of design and evaluation of computerized
systems, because it is important in reducing the causes of resistance to change and raise morale and notify
employees of their functional importance.</p>
