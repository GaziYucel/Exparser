        <p>This paper examines fatherhood from an intergenerational perspective, focussing on men who grew up in very different societies namely Ireland and Britain and who were fathers in two different historical periods; an older generation who came to the UK from Ireland between the 1940s and 1960s, and their adult sons who were born in the UK in the 1970s and who also became fathers of sons. It analyses the context of migration, and its implications for continuity and change across the generations in relation to social mobility and models of fatherhood and demonstrates how a strong work ethic and the cultural resources of religion and Irish ethnicity are transmitted to the next male generation. The data are drawn from a British study in which thirty generational chains of men were interviewed. The study adopted a biographical approach. In the context of this wider data set and particularly that from the Irish families the experiences of one Irish family are used to illustrate the transmission processes involved. In the family discussed, the cultural resources of an ambitious Irish mother and the strong work ethic of both parents produce upward occupational mobility in the second generation. The higher occupational status of the father is however played out via a male breadwinner model of fatherhood in which the father, like his own father, is driven by work.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>This article sets out to understand the context and influences of Irish migration to</title>
        <p>Britain in relation to men’s family lives over two generations. The lives of the older
generation, referred to henceforth as the grandfathers, were shaped by the disruptions
and circumstances associated with being an Irish migrant between 1940 and 1960
while for the younger generation – the fathers – fatherhood was played out in the
1990s and 2000s. The data are drawn from a British study in which thirty generational
chains of men were interviewed: eight chains of first generation Polish (migrant)
fathers, their fathers (living in Poland), and their sons (plus two chains of second
generation Polish fathers); ten chains of second generation Irish fathers, their fathers
(born in Ireland) and their sons; ten chains of white British fathers, their fathers (born
in the UK) and their sons who were aged 5-18. The study adopted a biographical
approach.2 The article focuses on one intergenerational chain. Firstly, it outlines the
approach to the study and briefly puts the migration of the Irish migrant grandfathers
in context. Secondly, it compares the life courses of the two generations and the social
and economic conditions in which the lives of the grandfathers and fathers unfold.
Thirdly, it explores men’s accounts of transmission. Finally, it discusses the ways in
which the experience of migration from a poor rural society plays out in the lives of
the second generation of fathers leading to upward social mobility. It shows how past
family history is incorporated into family identity in a different structural context.</p>

        <title>Despite their upward occupational mobility fathers reproduce similarities in fathering practices to those of their own fathers and retain an Irish identity while putting their own mark upon their identity.</title>

they live in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(the history-biography connection, see Mills 1959)</xref>
        . A life course

whole range of life domains highlighting turning points

direction. However, knowledge is not only sought at the individual level

2 The Biographic-interpretive Narrative Interviewing Method
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">(Wengraf 2001)</xref>
          was employed and adapted
for the grandfathers’ and fathers’ interviews. In the first part of the interview, the informants were
invited to give a life story. In the second part, they were encouraged to elaborate on salient
events/experiences selected by the interviewer from their initial narratives. Using a semi-structured
approach, the interviewers then asked about specific issues if they were already covered. The analysis
involved an initial separation of the life histories from the interpretive accounts
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">(Wengraf 2001)</xref>
          .
Attention was given to the narrative context including the interview encounter and present time frames
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Brannen/Moss/Mooney 2004)</xref>
          .
a similar historical location, it is also about the creation of collective cultures through
which continuities and discontinuities are transmitted intergenerationally. Cultures
express the tensions between synchronic and diachronic dimensions of ‘linked lives’
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Elder/Johnson/Crosnoe 2006)</xref>
          ; how individuals make connections with others
horizontally on the basis of belonging to the same age cohort while also relating to other
generations across historical time
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Mannheim 1952)</xref>
          . The fact of belonging to a
different historical location has consequences for the experience of being fathered and
the parenting of children. As
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">Mannheim (1952)</xref>
          argues, the formative years of
childhood and youth are critical in the shaping of common identities, albeit the same
events may not impinge on individuals and groups in the same ways. In experiential
terms generations hold “divided memories”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Giesen 2004, 22)</xref>
          so that memories of
different pasts shape perceptions of the present and the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transmission between family and historical generations varies according to the
field in which generational processes occur
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(Kohli 1999)</xref>
          . As emphasised by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">Bourdieu
(1990)</xref>
          , the social context in which the idea of a “generation” becomes meaningful is
pivotal. Thus intergenerational ambivalences may be stronger in relation to
disciplining children but weaker in promoting educational success. However, what passes
between generations in families, or is passed on, is often taken for granted since
transmission is what people do and is embedded in routine everyday practices and
relationships
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(Morgan 1999)</xref>
          . The transmission of family resources and cultures can
be implicit as well as explicit
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Bernstein 1996)</xref>
          . The notion of “family habitus”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Bourdieu 1990)</xref>
          denotes a set of dispositions related to particular practices which
may lead to regularities in patterns of transmission across family generations (ibid.). It
may involve “reasonable or common-sense behaviour” – forms of “spontaneity
without consciousness”, carried out without reflection or fuss by people who are operating
according to a “practical logic”, an embodied “feel for the game” rather than an
explicit plan or strategy
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Bourdieu 1975)</xref>
          . In the sense that habitus involves “produc[ing]
history on the basis of history”, dispositions can be cumulative (ibid., 56) and hence
become evident in an intergenerational study
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref13">(Brannen 2006)</xref>
          . Habitus demonstrates
both the “principle of both continuity and discontinuity”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(Wacquant 2008, 267)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Material and cultural transmission also creates, reproduces and transmits family
identities. However identities change over the life course and over generations as
family members seek to differentiate themselves from one another; that which is
transmitted alters as each generation makes its own mark upon what has been passed
on to it
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref6 ref7">(Bertaux/Bertaux-Wiame 1997)</xref>
          . A greater investment in the transmission of
identity is typically evident among those who fear the loss of cultural identity, as in
the case of migrants
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Delcroix 2000)</xref>
          . In this process ambivalences are created as a
new generation does better educationally than the parent generation generating new
class positions, dispositions and habits which may distance them from the parent
generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intergenerational transmission involves the transfer of material resources and
services, aspirations, values, practices, social learning, and models of parent-child
relations
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Bengston/Biblarz/Roberts 2002)</xref>
          . Parents’ socio-economic status and gender
play a key role in the transmission of values and aspirations through the
internalization of parents’ outlooks on and interests in life (ibid.), through communication
practices
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Bernstein 2000)</xref>
          , through investments in children’s human capital
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41 ref9">(Bourdieu
1986; 1990; Vincent/Ball 2006)</xref>
          . Children may also seek to be similar or differentiate
themselves through habitual, bodily and visual forms of (dis)identification
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(Mason
2008)</xref>
          . Gender (dis)identification is especially pertinent affecting the emotional
quality of parent-child relationships at particular life course phases.

      <title>The context of Irish migration</title>
      <p>
        Ireland was a colony of Britain until 1922 when all but its six northern counties
achieved independence as the Irish Free State which went on to re-name itself Ireland
in 1937 and declared itself a republic in 1949. For most of its modern history Ireland
has been a poor and rural society with a strong pattern of out migration. In the
aftermath of independence it withdrew into itself both economically and culturally and its
post-independence failure to develop accelerated rather than stemmed this migration
pattern
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Garvin 2004)</xref>
        . From the 1860s to the 1960s Ireland was Britain’s main source
of reserve labour
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">(Ryan 2004)</xref>
        .3 The 1950s and 1960s saw the largest outflow of
people from Ireland to the UK
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Garvey 1985)</xref>
        .4 Moreover, through Ireland’s history of
close contact with the modern industrial economies of the United States and Britain,
migration was part of Irish culture. In the West of Ireland where the land was poor
and migration heaviest, migration was part of a growing consciousness of alternative
futures. People lost confidence in their own culture and were increasingly influenced
by the market and material cultures of the large capitalist economies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Brody 1973)</xref>
        .
As well as seeking work, Irish migrants were attracted by the bright lights of the big
cities
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">(Walter 1999)</xref>
        . Most Irish migrants came from the countryside and lacked
education and skills. In the years following independence most Irish children had no
secondary education and left school at 14; secondary education was not free until the
late 1960s
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Garvin 2004)</xref>
        . Coming from a rural society which had no welfare state, the
new migrants joined a very different society; they found work in big cities and in the
construction industry (much of which was casualised and unregulated with high
accident rates), but they also had access for their children to free primary and secondary
education and other universal welfare benefits. Thereby they hoped to carve out a
better future for themselves and their families.

          Those who migrated were in the main young and single but, with one exception,

Ireland with his grandmother from the age of 8 to 14.</p>

          As migrants, few recalled experiencing discrimination themselves but commented
on the widespread discrimination against Irish people that existed at the time
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref39">(Hickman/Walter 1997; Ryan 2004)</xref>
          . From present vantage points most grandfathers
constructed in their interviews ‘transformative biographies’

          – presenting
themselves as having made something of their lives in Britain, and so dis-identifying
with the stereotypical portrait of Irishmen who fell on hard times (typically because of
the ‘demon drink’). Proud of being Irish several said they were grateful to Britain for
providing them with “a good living”, that is from the perspective of Ireland’s
impoverishment at the time they migrated. By contrast their sons, from the perspective of
greater current economic affluence (both in Ireland and Britain), reflected on the
difficulties their parents had faced as migrants in a particular historical period in
which the Irish were strongly discriminated against for political reasons and on
account of their “otherness” (accent), their low economic status and willingness to do
tough manual work.

he also joined his parents who by then were able to support him while he completed

but was forced to teach in Catholic schools in inner cities. On one occasion he went
for a teaching post in a private (public) school:</p>

        <title>The transition to adulthood was marked by the disruption of family relationships, a</title>
        <p>lack of qualifications, and the need to find their way in a new society hostile to
migrants. This in turn shaped the transition to fatherhood. As migrants they were free to

        <title>Irish grandfathers became fathers in their mid-20s, early in the life course by Irish standards (Hannan 2008). Because of factors to do with religion, marginalisation and ghettoization in Irish communities, many Irish in Britain (all but one in the study)</title>
        <p>married Irish women whom they had met either in Irish dance halls in Britain or on
visits back home.</p>
        <p>Brought up in a strongly religious environment in Ireland, the lives of this
generation were dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. Fatherhood was therefore
predicated on a Catholic culture influencing family planning and how they brought up their
children. Since the Church forbade the use of contraception, parenthood was expected
automatically to follow marriage. Eight of the ten grandfathers had their first child
within one year of marriage. However, compared with their families of origin this
generation had significantly fewer children; 3.2 children on average compared with</p>

        <title>Decisions about when to marry were influenced by the need for men to prove themselves good workers. The work ethic was the defining feature of their identities and a major source of male pride:</title>
        <p>I love working. I don’t like hanging around to be quite honest. I think if I was
out of work I would feel terrible, I really would. (Grandfather G.)
Being the main breadwinner in his family was “just a natural thing really you know”.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-5-10">
        <title>Grandfather G. worked all over the country in his job and sometimes had to stay away from home for weeks at a time. Especially when the children were young, he did not spend much time with his family:</title>
        <p>… used to work Saturday and Sunday … used to work as much overtime as I
could ... you know hard bringing a family up when you don’t have much
money.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-5-11">
        <title>Grandfather M. recalled having to work long hours labouring on the motorways. With hindsight and in the context of taking part in a study of fathers he reflected that he did not meet the current standards of fatherhood:</title>
        <p>At that time it was all about getting the money really to – put[ting] the food on
the table really ... and pay your mortgage. That’s really a big concern at that
stage.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-5-12">
        <title>Grandfathers also experienced financial pressures to support their parents and their siblings back home, some continuing to do this over their working lives. Remittances may have influenced marriage decisions and the timing of marriage although none made this link.</title>
        <p>In deciding to marry (and hence to have a family) they had to find suitable
housing. Several described discrimination from landlords; they used to say at that time
“No blacks, no dogs, no Irish.” Starting married life meant living in single rooms and
sharing bathrooms. The two routes out of this situation were to be rehoused by the
council5 or to purchase run down housing and renovate it through drawing on their

        The transition to adulthood for their sons born in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s was

independence – ‘young adulthood’

social life, no activities other than occasional games of cards on visits to kin.</p>
        <p>Seamas’ life course is typical of the first generation Irish. His transition to
adulthood came early. When Seamas was 13 his older brother left for England to find work
and a year later when he was 14 Seamas had to leave school. He helped run the farm
and did various odd jobs. Aged 17, Seamas went to England with a friend to look for
work. He worked on various large construction projects all over the country but based
himself in London. Some years later he bought a road making machine and became
self-employed. Intending initially to return to Ireland he got used to the “good
money”. Moreover, his family back in Ireland depended on his remittances.</p>
        <p>Aged 23, he married an Irish girl he met at an Irish dance hall in London. He was
making good money in the construction industry but was not yet on the housing
ladder. First, the couple lived in a rented room sharing the house with several Irish
families. Their first child was born there when Seamas was 24. After five years and a
second child the couple had saved enough money to put down a deposit on a large run
down property. By this time Seamas’ wife who was business minded was working
part time. Later, she set up her own building company, which was atypical both for
her time and compared with the other cases. This did not influence Seamas’ view of
himself as the family breadwinner, albeit it meant the family was relatively well off as
a consequence. The couple refurbished the property with help from family and friends
over several years. Work remained at the centre of Seamas’ identity; he worked long
hours, often seven days a week, with periods away from home. He was still working
at the time we interviewed him. From his current vantage point, his definition of a
“good father” has an old fashioned ring to it:
… suppose, make sure they’re provided and that they have everything they
want and looked after. That they get good schooling and ... they’re well reared
and looked after I suppose. They’re clean and kept well.</p>

experienced a “long period of youth”. At 18 he went to university. He enjoyed
considerable upward mobility through entry to the finance industry which was booming at the

      <sec id="sec-7-5">
        <title>Aged 29, the couple married and two years later their son was born (eight at interview). Two more children followed. Willie became a father later in the life course than his father and under much more favourable material conditions. By then, with two incomes from a well-paid industry, they had already bought their own house.</title>
        <p>Like his father, Willie’s life was driven by work. He too worked very long hours and
was often away from home and so lacked time for his children. However, despite the
fact that Willie had a university education and was in a management job, he and his

up. He also sent his children to his former Catholic primary school.</p>

        <title>The accounts of the two men mirror one another. Seamas said that communication</title>
        <p>between them was limited when Willie was a child mainly because he (Seamas) was
always working, a pattern which continued into adulthood. Like Seamas, Willie did
not recall his father spending much time with his father as a child: “he was never
there”, noting the similarities with his own fathering: “they’ll be in bed by the time
I’m home.” Willie’s memory of his relationship with his father while he was growing
up confirmed his father’s account – “non-confrontational” and sticking to “nice easy
soft subjects which remains the case now”. Willie confirmed that his mother was the
driving force in his life: “Dad didn’t have a clue the school even existed.”</p>
        <p>Both, father and son described living in different worlds on account of their work
and interests, using the same words. Seamas referred obliquely to differences in their
education and occupations “you know we’re in different worlds, kind of thing now”
while Willie noted:
… it was totally different to the world they came from – so they’re (parents)
both in construction. I went into the financial industry and um, I’m sure no
more than I didn’t know what they did – to a technical level they don’t have a
clue what I do.</p>

          –
in particular relational aspects such as communication, openness and closeness
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Dermott 2008)</xref>
          , while accepting that his fatherhood practice was confined to
breadwinning and involved little childcare and spending time with his children only at
weekends.
        </p>
        <p>I honestly think there’s more of a conscious effort for the father [today] to
have more one to one time with the children than previously and probably get
more engaged in what the children are up to and how they’re developing.
Willie considered himself “slightly more engaged” with his first born than his father
was with him at the same age, for example knowing more about his son’s school and
friends. At the same time, he suggested a similar segregation of marital roles for his
own and his parents’ marriage. He was however somewhat ambivalent about greater
father involvement, as were some other strongly work-focussed fathers of this
generation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-7-8">
        <title>While Willie spent little time with his children except at weekends, because of</title>
        <p>greater affluence and his particular skills he engaged in a wider range of activities
(computers, physical activities and taking them out) with his children than his own
father had done with him. But unlike his father he was more educationally ambitious
for his children and thought he was stricter with them. However, it was his wife who
helped with the children’s homework.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>Transmission between fathers and sons</title>
      <p>Possible explanations for Willie’s rejection of modern fatherhood practice (though not
its ideology) and his defence of a traditional male breadwinner role include the life
course experience shaped by his family history of migration which created a need to
build a better life for himself and his family. A further clue lies in the cultural sphere
of ‘family identity’ (as part of family memory) which is marked in this family by
strong continuities. Given that original identities play a pivotal role in constructing
biographical continuities, it is significant that Willie did not break with religious
tradition, that he married into an Irish family, that he still felt Irish, and that he stayed
geographically close to his parents.</p>
      <sec id="sec-8-1">
        <title>The transmission of identity is however habitual and not necessarily open to re</title>
        <p>flection, as may be seen in the way Seamas responded to questions relating to
transmission in the interview. Seamas could not think what he had inherited from his father
nor how he had influenced Willie except that he wanted a better life for him, just as
his had been better than his father’s.</p>
        <p>I didn’t want him to go out working like (inaudible) you know what I mean
working. It was great, he had school, he had a good childhood, you know what
I mean.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-2">
        <title>However, Seamas pointed to aspects of identification, claiming his children and their families as Irish:</title>
        <p>They’re all Irish, they’ve always you know (pause) they’ve always been round
with Irish and their friends here are Irish or Irish descent.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-3">
        <title>Seamas also asserted their similar tastes describing how father and son both enjoyed a</title>
        <p>pint and watching Gaelic football together. Also striking is the fact that Willie
continues to live near his parents in the same, now gentrified, community where he grew up.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-4">
        <title>But despite this communication between father and son was limited. Seamas com</title>
        <p>mented, emphasising the value he attached to ‘long hours’:</p>
        <p>We don’t really, we don’t communicate much better now, no. Well I don’t see
him to be honest, he’s always – you know we’re in different worlds, kind of
thing now … but I mean he does his own thing. He works good long hours
actually.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-5">
        <title>On the other hand, living so close Seamas helped Willie and his family with practical</title>
        <p>matters. For their part, both, his son and his grandsons helped Seamas with
computers. Moreover, close contact between the female generations was maintained.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-6">
        <title>Similarly, Willie suggested strong themes of Irish identity. He holds an Irish passport and counted himself as Irish while at the same time integrating country of birth and residence into his identity:</title>
        <p>Depends if it’s convenient to be one or t’other. Um, yeah I would see myself as
Irish. But it depends on who it’s going to annoy most typically.</p>
        <p>
          He remained a Catholic and a church goer, if an infrequent one. Willie gave a rich
account of the mainly cultural capital passed on both by his parents, referring to their
strong work ethic which he also wanted for his children. Like his father he spoke of
family resemblances
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(Mason 2008)</xref>
          , noting his delight at having been stopped in the
street by someone remarking on his own son’s resemblance to his grandfather. He
also felt that he had inherited his father’s social skills (“social demeanour”) and he
identified with his father’s equal treatment of others:
        </p>
        <p>I don’t give two hoots if you earn two grand a year or two million quid a year.
I will treat you exactly the same. I think that’s a big thing I’ve probably got
from him (pause) and then to a degree socialising in places that serve alcohol
is probably another major thing.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-7">
        <title>Among others, Willie saw his parents as role models for his children:</title>
        <p>... between us spending hundreds of hours a week with them (Mm) um, by the
way you act, by the way you talk – the views you have – how you encourage
them to discuss their views and develop their views – all of that will have a
huge consequence on them probably.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-8">
        <title>At the same time, he stressed that his parents did not intervene in areas such as religious upbringing or education.</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-9">
        <title>For his part Willie said he had no fixed ambitions for his sons; he would like to</title>
        <p>give them financial stability without handing everything to them on a plate. To some
extent his easy-going attitude is like his father’s:</p>
        <p>My level of empathy is you know short of having a limb hanging off, you know,
I’m not really worried about what happens to you, because it’ll be all right
tomorrow ... (wife) thinks I’m an emotional retard.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-10">
        <title>Reflecting at the end of the interview, Willie showed his awareness of the historical</title>
        <p>context which created discontinuity between his own life and that of his father. His
narrative demonstrates a detailed understanding of what it meant for men like his
father to migrate at that time, while he positions himself and his son in a very
different world:
To my mind I was brought up in a totally different economic environment to my
parents. I could not dream of leaving home at 13, by myself, going to foreign
country, finding work maybe through friends and neighbours, full time
working, living in a room with two or three others who I may or may not know, and
knowing that there’s no cheap Ryanair flight home … it’s a totally, totally
different world, you know. I think for both of them there was a lack of education,
formal education. Neither of them are stupid by a long shot, but you know to
my mind I was brought up in a totally different world to the world they came
from and the world they experienced, especially from like the ages of twelve,
thirteen onwards … and I don’t know if this changes from generation to
generation, but I just don’t see that same leap happening between the childhood I
had and the childhood my kids are having.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Willie’s eight year old son, Michael, expressed some resistance to his
father’s practices. He said he did not want the same kind of job and thought his father
had to work too hard and too long hours.</p>
        <p>... because sometimes he’s in a meeting and when there’s an argument then
sometimes he isn’t back till like two, three (in the morning) … which I get
really annoyed with.</p>
        <p>Michael gave a consistent and graphic account which confirmed what he saw to be
the negative impact of his father’s work on family life. In response to one of the
interview activity sheets concerning “Time with my dad”, Michael ticked the box “I would
like more time” and wrote down next to it very carefully “because I do not get to see
him often because he is at work”. Asked to complete the sentence “I like my dad
when – ”, Michael said cautiously: “When he (pause) when (pause) when he’s home
from work early. I don’t when he’s not home early.” He talked about having to pack
in lots of things over the recent bank holiday as his dad had to go to work the next
day. Michael also commented on the household’s gendered division of labour. Asked
about who did which activities in the home, he ticked few done by his father and was
rather critical of this, suggesting his father needed more practice, especially with
cooking.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-11">
        <title>There are also discontinuities here in ethnic identification in the third generation.</title>
        <p>When Michael was asked “Where do you say you are from if someone asks you?” he
was disdainful about being asked such “nosy questions” but said that since he
sounded English he would say “English”. However, at the same time, he was clearly well
aware of his Irish connections.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>
        This paper has examined how historical circumstances and the migration experience
of first generation Irish grandfathers created discontinuity in the second generation of
fathers in relation to education and occupation. The case of an Irish grandfather and
son shows how the structural contexts of migration and countries of origin and in
migration play out over time and in family memory. Compared with their working
class counterparts in our study
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Brannen/Mooney/Wigfall 2011)</xref>
        the migration
experience of the Irish grandfathers put them initially at great material and cultural
disadvantage in Britain: earlier transition to adulthood, less education, no qualifications,
less material or other support as young single men in Britain, concentration in a
dangerous industry, and the experience of discrimination. For religious reasons, the
transition to parenthood followed closely on the heels of marriage and, because of
discrimination, was accompanied by difficulties finding suitable family housing. As
main breadwinners in their households, they described themselves as “absent fathers”,
a view influenced by their consciousness of present day normative discourses of
“involved fatherhood”. Moreover this pattern of fathering was sustained by a gendered
division of labour in which mothers ran the households and did most of the child care.
Unable to help with their children’s academic studies because of their own lack of
education, grandfathers looked to Catholic schools and religion to help them bring up
their children “properly”. On the other hand, because of their origins in a very poor
rural society they defined themselves in terms of a very strong male breadwinner
work ethic.
      </p>
      <p>However, grandfathers did not pass on their own disadvantages to their sons but
gave them stable if not materially well endowed childhoods. In Willie’s case, as in the
other Irish cases, the spur to work hard was transmitted to the fathers through their
parents while encouragement to succeed in education came largely from their
mothers, especially in Willie’s case. The institutional context of Roman Catholic schools
was a further important feature which facilitated their educational success.
Circumscribed by their Irish families, communities and religious schools, the changed
historical context and institutional fabric in which sons grew up facilitated a different life
course pattern, enabling them to attain qualifications, and in the longer term high
status professional or managerial jobs (with one exception). This in turn led to later
transitions to fatherhood by which time fathers were established on housing ladders.9</p>
      <p>
        However, despite their upward occupational mobility, the fathers (with the same
one exception) practiced fatherhood in a way not dissimilar from that of their fathers,
involving little responsibility or “hands on” caring for children. They were either sole
or main breadwinners in their households although, according to the discourse of
gender equality, they did not see this as important. Like their fathers, because of long
working hours they had limited time for family life, a pattern reinforced by the
commitment of mothers in caring for children and also by a degree of precariousness in
current labour markets. While the two contexts of employment differed, both male
generations experienced insecurity. The grandfathers were employed in the 1960s and
1970s in the construction industry large parts of which were casual with little
unionisation or regulation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Clegg 1979 passim)</xref>
        while the fathers, employed in the 1990s and
2000s, experienced widespread deregulation of the UK economy, bringing job
insecurity and work intensification into many higher status jobs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(Lewis/Brannen/Nilsen
2009)</xref>
        . However the fathers’ higher educational level and income provided them with
many more opportunities which protected them in the context of unemployment.

        <title>Irish fathers subscribed to this normative discourse. As in the case of middle class</title>
        <p>Willie whose time at home was heavily constrained by his career, his upward
occupational mobility was not accompanied by significant changes in his fatherhood
practice. Only one second generation Irish father, a lone parent, shared the care of his two
children on an equal basis (with his ex-wife). Significantly he was in a low status
(administrative) job. In this case a succession of life course events led to a different
trajectory; a failure to fulfil his academic potential despite having gained some passes
in the General Certificate of Secondary Education examination which is taken at 1610;
a move away from Catholicism in adolescence; marriage outside the Irish community;
and difficulty developing a career. A decisive turning point was the break-up of his
marriage at which time he was faced with a critical decision namely to share the care
of his children and not to prioritise work.</p>

generations. In Willie’s case, as in all but one of the Irish cases, as a son of a migrant
it was the transmission of a will to succeed in education and the workplace which
appears to have been significant in reproducing particular fatherhood practices.
Structural ambivalence is also mediated via the transmission of cultural resources
which form part of the migrant family heritage in particular through the persistence of
a strong sense of Irish identity. Like Willie, the fathers’ “Irishness” was sustained in
their childhoods through growing up in Irish communities in the UK and annual
pilgrimages made with parents to Ireland in the summer holidays. Irish identity also
continued to be closely entwined with religious identity
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Bruce et al. 2004, 13)</xref>
          but did
not preclude identification with Britain. Irish identity was transmitted between fathers
and sons sometimes through passing on Irish names; and importantly via cultural
performance such as going to church and cultural centres some of which pertained to
particular forms of masculinity; having “a pint” together at the pub, watching and
playing particular Gaelic sports, a mutual interest in Irish music. The two generations
also pointed to the transmission of gendered family dispositions and resemblances
manifest in references to similar appearance, character and manner, propensities for
sociability and competence in “talking the talk” (an iconic Irish characteristic), as in
the case of Seamas and Willie. These forms of transmitted cultural capital are the
means by which Irish male generations created a shared history in the context of the
migration experience.

        <p>At the same time, as in Willie’s case, structural ambivalences of social mobility
were not entirely reconciled at a personal level. Willie constructed his world as very
different from that of his migrant father, while also being conscious that this was part
of his heritage. There were therefore clear differences between the generations in a</p>
