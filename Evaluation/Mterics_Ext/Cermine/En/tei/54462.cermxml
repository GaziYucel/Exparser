        <p>Prompt advancement in product / service and process technology, many operations in the manufacturing and service industries in recent years require competitive HR practices. So this research study stresses on HR planning and audit practices. HR planning is all about good management; good strategic management; good business management and particularly good people management. It is important that you put thought and careful planning into your human resource practices. And the purpose of the HR Audit is to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the HR function to identify areas of strength and weakness and where improvements may be needed. Conducting an audit involves a review of current practices, policies, and procedures, and may include benchmarking against organizations of similar size and/or industry. This research aims to figure out the practices, employee perception and measures adopted by HEG limited for Human resource planning and audit. Chi square test is applied at (.05 or 5 %) significance level in this paper to check the authenticity of data given by the respondents. Findings suggests that it is difficult to assess accurate HR planning and adopting accurate audit practices because practices itself does not produce right or wrong answers, but it produces a series of alternatives from which the right course of action can be chosen.</p>

      <title>1. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The historical role of Human Resources has changed spectacularly since its inception in
the early 1900s. Formerly it was mainly a clerical function but now human resource is a
strategic partner in planning and attaining organizational policies and goals. Today’s business
climate puts the obligation on the HR department to accept the challenge of doing more with
less, while contributing value toward business objectives. Human resources also has to
address the rapidly changing conditions affecting the type of employees required and their
changing needs, so the function requires flexible and knowledgeable practitioners. Hence HR
planning has become an integral part of business. All companies, organizations, institutions
consist of people and are meant to serve the people with products and services. Humans,
therefore, are not only the resources of organizations but are the main instrument of their

progress. It is not enough to say „people are our most precious asset of business. Instead we
must say our company or organization (including its results) is a creation of our people.</p>
      <p>In order to pace the talk of being a “business partner,” HR managers have to provide
real evidence that they are having a strategic business impact. Management is often asking,
“How are we doing?” However, this is not always an easy question to answer. This is
especially so, when it is difficult to obtain some type of objective measuring tool to determine
how well a certain HR function is performing. To validate the claim of being “business
partners”, HR managers must clearly demonstrate how HR services can accomplish the
business objectives set forth by the organization. The HR function is often overlooked for
audits/measurement tools, to assess its effectiveness and legal regulatory compliance.
However, the HR Audit is a process that sets the stage for a true transformation in HR
strategy and services. It links HR systems and services to organizational objectives while
focusing on the business needs of internal customers.</p>
      <p>
        The success of a business is directly linked to the performance of those who work for
that business. Underachievement can be a result of workplace failures. Because hiring the
wrong people or failing to anticipate fluctuations in hiring needs can be costly, it is important
that you put effort into human resource planning. Planning for HR needs will help to ensure
your employees have the skills and competencies your business needs to succeed. It will
better prepare you for staff turnover, recruitment, and strategic hiring – and improve stress
when you have emergency/last-minute hiring needs. With effective human resource planning,
HR audit implies critical examination and evaluation of policies, programs and procedures in
human resource management. [

      <title>2. DOES HR PLANNING AND AUDIT MATTERS?</title>
      <p>In essence, workforce or HR planning is about predicting future labor market needs. It
requires an understanding of the make-up of the current workforce, an investigation into
future service needs and an analysis of the type and size of workforce required to meet them.
It is becoming increasingly important for agencies as they adopt new ways of operating in
order to adapt to changes.</p>
      <p>The challenge will be to ensure that agencies can minimize the costs and grab the
opportunities that such changes brings - quicker career progression, effective recruitment, and
more flexible job design and workforce deployment. By identifying workforce capabilities
and by considering what will be needed in the future and planning systematically, managers
can limit the risks associated with unanticipated events. In particular, HR planning will help
organizations to:


</p>
      <p>Identify potential problems, manage risk and minimize crisis management cycles.
Contain human resources costs, including the cost of turnover, absenteeism, structural
changes and staff movements.</p>
      <p>Develop workforce skills that take time to grow.</p>
      <p>
        Optimize the use of human, financial and other resources. [

      </p>
      <p>Apart from it the reason for conducting an HR audit is to find out how effective and
efficient the organization’s HR activities are and to determine the areas for improvement and
identify changes. The purpose of the HR Audit is to conduct a more in depth analysis of the
HR function to identify areas of strength and weakness and where improvements may be
needed. Conducting an audit involves a review of current practices, policies, and procedures,
and may include benchmarking against organizations of similar size and/or industry. An HR
Audit in effect includes five different components.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Functional Audit</title>
      <p>This aspect of the HR audit examines:
 Your HRD systems and procedures, encompassing training and development, organization
development and career development.
 Whether your HRD systems and procedures are aligned with the HRM systems and
procedures to promote competence, confidence and performance. This includes job
design, HR planning, performance management systems, selection and staffing.
 Fairness and consistency in compensation and benefits, employee relations and your HR
record keeping, particularly in regard to providing timely management information.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Service Audit</title>
      <p>This aspect of the audit activity looks at the service responsiveness and reliability of the
HR function. This will include an assessment of such things as response times, willingness to
help line managers/staff, and the knowledge of the HR staff etc.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Compliance Audit</title>
      <p>This assesses the degree to which HR is compliant with the relevant legislation – e.g.
Labor Laws, etc. This part of the audit will assess whether the required policies, practices, and
procedures exist, and to what extent management and labor have been trained to enact these
codes of best practice.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>Financial Management Audit</title>
      <p>A comprehensive audit of HR systems and procedures needs to go beyond the
inspection level. Basic financial ratios/scorecard measures appropriate for a staff function like
HR need to be put in place to audit the efficiency of the various HR functions.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Strategic Audit</title>
      <p>Each organization should have an overall people management strategy that aims to
increase the value of employees to the business. The strategic audit will examine whether the
HR strategy, policies and processes are aligned with and support the achievement of the
business’s mission and objectives.</p>

      <p>HEG believes that productivity enhancement comes from well-structured and focused
training and development programs. The Company continually endeavors to equip its
workforce with the latest tools and techniques to help them raise their level of efficiency and
effectiveness. In 2003, M/S Hewitt Associates were retained by HEG for HR Intervention and
initiatives broadly covering Job Evaluation, Performance Measurement, Competency
Assessment and Development, Organization Re-structuring and Reward Management. The
company has subsequently implemented most of the recommendations and is of the view that
each of these initiatives would go a long way in fostering an environment that allows
employees to fully utilize their abilities to perform better and to drive the performance of the
company.</p>

      <title>6. RATIONAL OF THE STUDY</title>
      <p>Manpower or Human resources are asset for any organization and specifically for the
manufacturing units, where employees act as the talent warehouse.</p>
      <p>Due to the importance of human resources, human resource planning is also in the
limelight. To utilize the employee’s efficiency it is imperative to have full description about
the employee as well as the job for which he is available.</p>
      <p>Workforce planning will be critical to the HEG limited, as it administers the
generational change taking place in the workforce. Labor market supply and demand factors,
work and family considerations, and equity and diversity issues are rapidly taking place.</p>
      <p>For example, The Company has an older age profile and its workforce is mature aged
and significant numbers of senior staff are approaching retirement, which means valuable
corporate knowledge could be lost.</p>
      <p>Hence, in this dynamic scenario, the importance of human resource planning and audit
can’t be neglected. On the other hand Auditing HR practices require assessing the
arrangement of services offered by an HR department. Hence effective implementation of HR
policies secures utmost importance for which HR audit is conducted.</p>

      <title>7. REVIEW OF LITERATURE</title>
      <p>
        Sanjeev K. Bordoloi, Hirofumi Matsuo (2001) studies that because of rapid evolution in
product and process technology, many operations in the manufacturing and service industries
in recent years require workers to acquire and maintain more extensive ``knowledge stock''
than before. In this paper, we address the human resource planning in these
knowledgeintensive operations. We focus on the management of knowledge mix, that is, the mix of
workers in different knowledge levels. This research was conducted in a semiconductor
equipment manufacturing plant that uses an assembly line to achieve high productivity.
However, the plant also needs to increase ability to deal with a high degree of product
customization, frequent technology and product changes, and relatively low volume of
production, which collectively require a high level of knowledge development for each
worker. We extend methodology developed for managing production and work-in-process
inventory levels for a manufacturing system that is subject to random production yields.
However, the structure of our problem is different, and thus requires a separate mathematical
development. Our results indicate that the company we studied underestimated the ideal
number of workers in the higher knowledge levels in the steady state. But this problem, by
itself, can be taken care of by a good intuitive heuristic. We then demonstrate that our control
rule is superior to the good intuitive rule from the point of view of additional stability that is
obtained from less variability in the work force levels. We offer managerial implications of
this additional stability using our computational results [

        Ghazala Ishrat, Javed Habib (2012) finds that in the changing economic and business
environment, proper Human Resource Management has assumed a crucial role in the growth
of the organization. It has become imperative to re-look at this most important asset of the
organization. The main objective behind this research was to gain in-depth knowledge of the
Human Resource and the effectiveness of HR functions within an organization. The HR audit
in University was planned to get a clear judgment about the overall status of most
faculties/Departments and to find out whether existing systems and procedures are yielding
desired result. This information will be an invaluable input while making strategic decisions.
The human resource audit involved examining current policies, practices and strategies of all
the departments/faculties to verify the effectiveness and helping University to improve its
productivity, transparency and efficiency. To conduct Human Resource Audit in University
extensive study on various aspects related to faculties, students and staff were analyzed and
studied through interviews of staff at various levels, observation of working of non teaching
staff, taking responses from students and staff by questionnaire method and documents review
at various levels. The firsthand experience has helped us in our specialization in HR as this
enhanced our prospective of thoughts. The concise suggestions/ recommendations emerged
after in depth analysis and study will provide with a wide scope to understand the functions
and mechanism of working in any organization [

        Dr. Shikha N. Khera, Ms. Karishma Gulati (2012) states that Human resource information
system (HRIS) is not new concept but it is recuperating day by day with changing
environment. Its major role is in human resource planning (HRP) which itself a crucial
activity in any organization. Ineffective HRP can lead to extra or fewer numbers of employees
than needed. Both over and under number of employees can create crappy situations. HRIS
helps in proper planning of human resources. This paper focuses on the role of HRIS in HRP.
The research is empirical in nature as 127 respondents from top 7 IT companies (as per their
market share) are taken to see the sights of the objectives. The survey is done with the
assistance of the questionnaire. After investigation it is concluded that HRIS has various
benefits but the foremost is HRIS stores ample data about the employees of the organizations
that helps in escalating the snail’s pace of HRP. HRIS also helps in the strategic activities of
HR managers and more in training and development, succession planning, applicant tracking
in recruitment and selection and manpower planning. While analyzing the overall contribution
of HRIS in HRP it is concluded that HRIS identifies occupied and unoccupied positions in an
organization very effectively and accurately [

        The paper of Linda O’Brien-Pallas, Stephen Birch, Andrea Baumann, Gail Tomblin
Murphy (2001) is one in 10 in a series of papers commissioned by the World Health
Organization to take stock of the state of the science of human resources for health activities
in the year 2000. This paper provides an analysis of how labor market indicators can be
integrated into service planning, discusses whether planning is sufficiently responsive and
flexible to retain relevance and validity in rapidly changing health systems, describes different
models and approaches to linking and integrating workforce planning and service planning,
discusses methodological approaches to integrating planning, and examines effective
approaches to the use of computer based scenario modeling to support assessment of current
and future planning options. The context and broad cross-cutting themes of public sector,
political, social, and macro-economic changes have been considered. Where publications
exist, empirical evidence serves as the basis for this analysis and country examples have been
highlighted. While strides have been made in the practice of resource planning world-wide,
health human resource planning in most countries has been poorly conceptualized,
intermittent, varying in quality, profession specific in nature, and without adequate vision or
data upon which to base sound decisions [

        Mark S. Van Clieaf (1992) studies that new approaches to executive search and executive
resource planning are required if these functions are to have a strategic impact on improving
organizational performance. The need to map and match specific executive perspectives and
competencies to the future needs of the business is required if executive search and executive
resource planning are to become strategic management tools. This paper examines the three
“drivers” of strategic leadersbip and provides a framework for synchronizing specific
executive perspectives and competencies to these three drivers. A case study illustrates bow
common practices such as raiding direct competitors for executive talent or always promoting
from within may be counterproductive to the strategic needs of the business.
Recommendations for applying these new concepts at the board corporate, and strategic

11. CONCLUSION</p>
        <p>Establishing a HR Planning framework and audit practices is a major achievement, that
enables an organization to ensure how best to use its human resources to achieve outputs and
outcomes. Employee plays crucial role in the success of business organization, it is important
that organization should put consideration and careful planning into human resource practices.
It is imperative that your Human resource practices should correspond with your business
plans. Human resource planning is an ongoing process. Organization must continually
monitor and forecast personnel needs and concerns. Human resource planning is something
that you can learn and improve on through experience and effort. Similarly a Human
Resources Audit is a comprehensive method (or means) to review current human resources
policies, procedures, documentation and systems to identify needs for improvement and
enhancement of the HR function as well as to ensure compliance with ever-changing rules
and regulations. An Audit involves systematically reviewing all aspects of human resources.
HR audit helps to link the long term purpose, goals and objectives of the HR function/HR
plans. It also examines what people are presently doing in their jobs in the organization. It
examines and analyze what kinds of people are doing the work at present and the present
strengths and weaknesses of the HR policies. Finally it compares present and future
jobs/people/HR practices.</p>
        <p>SUGGESTIONS
 Changing culture requires leaders to understand the learning process dynamics and how
the learning and unlearning of assumptions and beliefs can be manipulated to modify human
needs and behavior.
 Effective HR audit requires equal standards against which procedures and
implementation of policies are assessed. In the absence of equal standards, policies are
assessed with subjectivity, which may destroy the process of audit.
 One training program should not be designed to serve a numerous of purposes because it
may be unclear and difficult &amp; results into failure. The solution is to separate training and
assessment program should be designed for development of employees.
 HR planning should be job-related. Job description should be given to the employees.
Bring them into the line of organization's goals with the job objectives so that every
employee’s work lead to the organizational goal.
 Since the goal of HR planning system is to achieve the organizational goal. Hence there
is immense need to coach the employee before and after appointment regularly. Provide the
resources required by them to get to the management's expectations.
 Deliver training and development for new and experienced employees that enhances
critical competencies and behaviors.
 Create career development systems that identify, prepare, and promote employees whose
experience and skills match the demands of higher-level positions.
 Design the system which is free from biasness and favoritism because it discourages the
employee when it comes to appointment of employees in a long run case.
 Review the systems that support the on-going relationship with the employee. This
includes looking at the performance management system, assessing the state of your
compensation structures, training and development, plus looking how you handle employee
grievances or complaints.
 Company should assess how well do you inform and educate your employees on your
policies, procedures, and practices.
 Improper information should not be retained in primary personnel files.
 HEG should review its existing human resource policies to ensure completeness and
relevance to the department’s current context; ensure widespread communication and
understanding of human resource policies; regularly monitor compliance to human resource
policies; and update human resources policies on an ongoing basis.
 When management establishes targets in their human resource plan, management should
ensure that strategies are established to achieve those targets.
 Suitable policies and procedures to support the development and management of human
resources are established, maintained, and communicated.
 HEG should consider developing a multi-year integrated business and human resource
plan for the department that is adjusted annually to reflect the priorities of the current year.
 HEG must consider all the available options for strategically promoting job openings and
encouraging suitable candidates to apply.
 Determine the gap between where your organization wants to be in the future and where
you are now. The gap analysis includes identifying the number of staff and the skills and
abilities required in the future in comparison to the current situation.
 HR Planning and audit objectives can be achieved successfully when there is a link or
alignment between organizational and unit objectives so to avoid the conflict between team
and organization's objectives.</p>
