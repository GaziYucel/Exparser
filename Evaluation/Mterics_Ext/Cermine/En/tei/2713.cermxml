        <p>An enlarged EU might be structurally integrated, but the ways in which pre-1989 EU members used to imagine their counterparts during the Cold War period have profoundly influenced the ways in which 'east' Europe has been and still is thought nowadays (hence the remaining ideational divergences within a political Europe). The paper argues that European construction and pos-1989 enlargement of the EU towards East imply a form of subtle and untold domination of the Western part of the continent subtlety and at times unconsciously by institutions of the EU or by academic discourses on Central and Eastern Europe. Such domination, as an unintended consequence, is best explored on the ideational level and through the central role that 1989 has taken in this process. Discussing slope-metaphors and allochronisms in the field of a European common memory, this paper shows how artificial distances are created between Eastern and Western Europe. By combining allochronism and heteronomy, we have coined the new term of 'heterochrony' to express the situation in which a given group does not have the capacity of choosing its own laws and the cognitive means to think of itself and where such situation is due to reasons of different time location (in that case in a backward situation) than other autonomous groups. Such heterochrony might lead to a halt of transnational cooperation in Europe and have negative impacts on the self-perception of Europe.</p>

      <p>
        We will discuss in this paper the view that the enlarged European Union we now live in and
which we intellectually perceive is as much the direct result of 1989 than it is of the efforts to create
the first European Communities in the 1950s. The breaking apart of the Communist block ushered
in a new era for a political Europe where positive features
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref37">(EU enlargement commenced in 1995 by
incorporating the hitherto ‘neutral’ states of Austria, Finland and Sweden, not to mention the 2004
and 2007 enlargements)</xref>
        coexist with more problematic ones (unsolved security agreements between
the EU and Russia, some occidentalist reductionist ways of describing Eastern Europe in urgent
need to catch up with (Western) Europe, or the stumbling bocks still existing between East and
West on the debate of a common European memory). One could say that 1989 ‘made’ Europe, but
in an imperfect manner. So, what has been the impact of European integration on 1989? Prior
western European integration facilitated and legitimated, it may be surmised, the notion of a ‘return
to Europe’ voiced by the dissidents and revolutionaries in the Soviet bloc as well as the
Gorbachevian notion of a Common European Home. Yet, how was the transformation of Europe
after 1989 constrained and enabled by the pre-existence of a common western political project?
1989 ‘made’ Europe because what was hitherto a divided continent now became united.
More specifically, the revolutions of 1989 brought in their wake German unity. Negotiations
regarding German unification and the integration of this new Germany into western structures were
to change fundamentally the reality and the idea of Europe. One could say that Germany epitomizes
the problem of an enlarged Europe Union to 27 members: by incorporating the eastern part into the
western part of the FRG, the historical experience and identity of the GDR tended to be written off
and to disappear (and quite symptomatically, they are dubbed the ‘new’ Länder so as to insist that
things had be started anew there) based on the assumption that they had little, or simply nothing to
offer to the western experience or ways of doing politics and of imagining itself.
      </p>
      <p>We will argue that a same phenomenon has happened between EU15 (western Europe) and
the new 12 EU member states: 15+12 may have created an enlarged EU that is now indeed
structurally integrated (or in the continuous process of complete integration), but the ways in which
EU15/West Germany used to imagine their/its counterpart(s) during the Cold War period have
profoundly influenced the ways in which ‘east’ Europe has been and still is thought nowadays
(hence the ideational divergences that this conference tries to tackle). Put differently, the process of
ideational convergence that EU enlargement should have carried through and fulfilled in the period
1989-2004 was profoundly and negatively affected by an occidentalist bias in which the
GDR/Eastern Europe was thought not on the basis of its own merit, features or characteristics but as
the negative Other of an integrating Western Europe. ‘Othering’ mechanisms most frequently
contribute to simplifications and negative stereotypes, and this paper will discuss some of these
mechanisms and their consequences in the power relation between eastern and western Europe. Of
interest for us here will be the case of collective memory around European themes, political
contributions to a European acquis and questions of collective autonomy, and how 1989 has been a
turning point in such problematic mutual perceptions between Eastern and Western Europe. The
paper will not discuss the institutional arrangements of post-1989 EU life but dwells at length on
ideational and cognitive issues for two reasons. One because ‘Europe’ (as a political project) needs
to rethink itself if it wants to be more inclusive and more democracy-friendly (the self-reflective
dimension of Europe). Second, because for individuals and state to feel as fully equals within the
European realms need not just to have the same access to EU institutions but should also have equal
access to cognitive means1 (the capacity of auto-institution on the cognitive level).</p>
      <p>Of central concern in this paper is the study of certain discourses articulated around deep
differences between East/West and favoring dichotomous understanding of Europe. We will try to
understand why such discourses occur, what are their meanings and discuss some of their examples,
a famous illustration being that of Norman Davies when he dissects the division ‘East and West
Europe’. In that perspective (and in his critique the occidentalistic-cum-orientalistic framework)
Norman Davies shows how the famous curriculum course on ‘Western Civilisation’ introduces
sloppy reasoning and judgemental dualisms of the following kind:
1. That the western and eastern halves of Europe are separate entities with little or nothing in
common.
2. That Eastern Europe is not really part of Europe, or not part of ‘the real Europe’.
3. That the East-West division of Europe, which can be observed in different manifestations at
different times, is fixed and permanent.
4. That ‘the West’ is superior.
5. That all summaries of Western civilisation / European history can safely omit anything which
belongs to the different and inferior East. (The only exception to this rule is Russia, which,
being powerful, automatically qualifies for inclusion.) (Davies 2006: 60).</p>
      <p>This type of idea is also somehow embedded in much of the political science literature dealing with
democratization and civil society promotion. There, one can find similar biases simply in the fact
that ‘transition’ has to be managed from outside by western donors (instead of counting on local
forces), or that civil society often has to be constructed and engineered into the right type of
political participation (rather than leaving the existing institution choosing their own course of
action and rhetoric to do so).2</p>
      <p>
        Attila Melegh, in a recent stimulant book, questions also such dualisms and argues that an
East-West slope runs across the self-perception of Europe. This slope implies a sense of normative
judgment where the west is the positive endpoint of the slope (embodied by a liberal humanitarian
utopia) that easterners of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are supposed to climb to reach
‘freedom’, ‘democracy’, ‘market economy’ and the like, while on the lower end, an abnormal East
is trailing behind in a state of ‘backwardness’ in which the legacy of the past or ‘incomplete
nationalisms’3 weighs heavily
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(Melegh 2006: 1-3)</xref>
        . Melegh’s point is obviously not to ‘measure’ at
which points various countries, institutions or individuals are positioned onto this slope, but “is
rather how these ‘East-West slopes’ based on the idea of diminishing civilization toward the ‘East’
enable the translations of ‘liberal humanitarian utopias’ onto a global scale and how the related
identity structures actually operate and transform themselves into social and political action or
individual narratives in the context of Central and Eastern Europe” (ibid: 2). In other words this
imaginary slope has a constitutive role in the self-perception and self-understanding of people of
and involved with Central and Eastern Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will argue in this paper that European construction (around the EU, alternatively referred
to as ‘Europe’ as oppose to Europe, the geographical space independent of the political Union) and
enlargement of the EU towards East imply a form of subtle and untold domination of the Western
1 I draw here inspiration on the work of Castoriadis for whom autonomy is not just a political autonomy a la Rousseau,
but also the capacity to choose its cognitive means to do so (Castoriadis 1986, 1997 and 1999). We will develop later
this point in the part dealing with heterochrony. See in particular Section 3.b.
2 For a critique of this Promothean conception of democracy and civil society promotion which does not consider
enough local resources and that has negative social effects, see, e.g., Hann &amp; Dunn (1997) and

part of the continent subtlety and at times unconsciously by institutions of the EU or by academic
discourses on Central and Eastern Europe. Such domination, bordering at times with coloniality4 as
an unintended consequence, is best explored on the ideational level and through the central role that
1989 has taken in this process. That there was a relation of power between the EU and (soon to be)
candidate Eastern European states in the period 1989-2004 is out of doubt (one just needs to think
of the Copenhagen criteria to respect in order to become part of the club). The sub-hypotheses we
are exploring here is that domination is not a conscious fact but a consequence of institutional
practices rooted in a European community born during the Cold War and of certain academic
devices reinforcing divides between social groups (in our case, the ‘east’ and the ‘west’). In this
process, 1989 plaid a particular role by leaving a lasting imprint on official discourses on Eastern
Europe and influenced by a reading of Communism having atomized and destroyed all positive
constitutive elements in Eastern Europe that had no other issue but to catch up and emulate the
western ways of doing.
      </p>
      <p>Such view can be found elsewhere nowadays in some of the debates about a European
memory and historical representation of Europe. To advance a metaphor, we could say that on the
theme of European memory and identity, there is a sort of East-West slope running across the
continent where, e.g. Eastern Europe still needs to come to term with the Holocaust and still needs
to do some work on its collective history with regard to the extermination of Jews.5 We argue that
there is a slope here as well, because differences in the Vergangenheitsbewältigungen tend to be
expressed not only in normative term (‘they must come to term with this problem’, or ‘they have
not done their homework’, etc.), but also in terms of different time locations (‘they are trailing back
on the work on memory, etc). Johannes Fabian, in his important albeit little quoted work on Time
and the Other (1983), underlines that one of the favorite ways for anthropology to ‘make its
objects’ is through time and what he terms ‘denial of coevalness’ (Fabian 1983: 32) or
‘allochronism’ (from the Greek ‘allos’ for ‘other, and ‘xronos’ for time). Allochronism could be
defined as the (usually forced) positioning of one’s group in a different time than that of the
reference group. His thesis is that “anthropology has emerged and established itself as an
allochronic discourse; it is a science of other men in another Time. It is a discourse whose referent
has been removed from the present of the speaking/writing subject” (ibid.: 143).</p>
      <p>
        Although Fabian criticizes the discipline of anthropology (for its contribution to the
realization of colonialism), his arguments runs parallel to that of Melegh, when the former sustains
that anthropology “promoted a scheme in terms of which not only past cultures, but all living
societies were irrevocably placed on a temporal slope, a stream of Time—some upstream, others
downstream. Civilization, evolution, development, acculturation, modernization (and their cousins,
industrialization, urbanization) are all terms whose conceptual content devices, in ways that can be
specified, from evolutionary time” (Fabian 1983: 17). The problem with such allochronism and
slope-metaphor is not that they ascribe people definitively to a certain place, or position on the scale
of civilization or of Erinnerungsarbeit, but that they create artificial distances between different
groups and that they ‘otherize’ given social groups. They put certain groups in a more active (the
one judging the time location and deciding of the allochronism) or passive stance (the group lagging
behind6). The negative results for the group at a lower end of such othering process and delineation
4 Melegh defines colonialty as “a system of power understood as a complex form of domination, including the
hierarchical classification of the populations of the planet, the reformulation of local concepts of space and time, the
export of sexual energies into the ‘East’, the ‘imperial gaze’ and most importantly the colonization of consciousness.
The latter point can be summed up as ‘an energy and a machinery to transform differences into values’ and as the
consequence ‘subalternization of knowledge and societies”

Eastern European nationalisms.
process between active/passive, modern/traditional is first that, as Melegh argues, it affects the
selfunderstanding of such people leading to discriminatory or racist views, and second that it
disempowers them putting them in a situation of heteronomy7. By combining allochronism and
heteronomy, we have coined the new term of ‘heterochrony’ to express the situation in which a
given group does not have the capacity of choosing its own laws and the cognitive means to think
of itself and where such situation is due to reasons of different time location (in that case in a
backward situation) than other autonomous groups. Let us see now how such theme can be found in
the post-1989 phase, how this has become an institutional problem and how it relates to the question
of European memory.
      </p>
      <p>If there was an impact of 1989 on European ‘integration’8, there is probably also some
reflections to gain from the following reversed question: What has been the impact of European
integration on 1989? In other words, has the transformation of a post-1989 eastern Europe been
constrained by the pre-existence of a common western political project, west of the Iron Curtain? If
so, how? To give short answers to this question, we will resort to three sub-questions.</p>
      <p>The first question: Has there been an impact of 1989 on European Integration? If so, of
what kind? This is well beyond the scope of this paper, and 1989 surely had a variety of impacts on
European integration and European societies at large. A short answer, easier to give now that the
2004 and 2007 enlargements took place is that the collapse of Iron Curtain has allowed the entry of
former communist as well as some neutral countries into the EEC/EU. 1989 has, in a way, given a
new impetus towards a revamped and enlarged common ‘European House’ (to take the phrase of
Gorbatchov). But why was it that ‘Europe’ became the roof for integration of a post-1989 eastern
Europe? This leads us to the second question.</p>
      <p>What has been the impact of European integration on 1989? The response, though
seemingly tautological, is simply another wave of ‘European integration’, yet of another kind. Since
the EEC was one of the most effective supra-national political institutions at the time of the collapse
of the Soviet empire, the model of European integration provided a direct blueprint or a clear
horizon for eastern Europe (hence the (problematic) notion shared by many that there was a ‘return
to Europe’). The process is what is referred to in neo-institutionalist parlance as a case of
pathdependency. Once the project of an effective European community was re-launched in the 1980s
and that political momentum was given towards further integration by the 1987 Single Act, the
existing and already expanding European institution was the natural candidate at the time of the
Soviet collapse to preside over renewed collaboration between East and West. Other
‘panEuropean’ institutions existed and mattered already back then, like NATO, Conference for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Council of Europe, but since the post-1989 task
included also the question of German re-unification (a still very sour point to many European states
back in 1989, and an issue that had driven a decisive wedge in the East-West relationship in the
7 To define heteronomy, we will tap again into the work of Castoriadis. Autonomy, as pointed earlier, is the capacity to
choose its own laws and the cognitive means to do so. An autonomous society is one that has the capacity of
autoinstitution, that is the capacity for societies to openly ‘call into question their own institution, their representation of the
world, their social imaginary significations’ (Castoriadis 1997: 17).</p>
      <p>
        In an heteronymous society, there is no capacity to choose its laws and/or there is closure on the cognitive level. By
closure Castoriadis means that a given society does not have the possibilities to choose the ways and means in which
they reflect about themselves. Closure implies the law of others imposed on this society.
8 The term ‘integration’ would be discussing since it is highly contentious. For a discussion of the term ‘integration’ see
the work on US-influence on the first steps of European construction in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">Winand (1993)</xref>
        and

nascent cold war in the late 1940s), the issue of East-West unification had to be subordinated to a
political forum with binding supra-national powers and in which the USA could have a say.9 NATO
could not be such a forum
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref9">(because of its military nature and the reluctance of the Soviet Union/CIS
to abandon all of its sphere of influence—although NATO was also part of the discussion back in
1989, as much as it is still part of the problem in Europe now if one just looks at the stand off
between Russia and Europe on the question of Georgia this Summer)</xref>
        , while the Council of Europe
and the CSCE (transformed in 1994 into the OSCE) were only too loose inter-governmental
institutions to be able to decide on such important matters. Moreover, as observes
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Delcour (2008)</xref>
        ,
by the time of the Wall collapse, the EEC was already engaged in managing a flow of aid to Poland
and Hungary and therefore the EEC was the natural candidate to cope with the task of helping
Eastern Europe out of planed economy and of bureaucratic dictatorships.
      </p>
      <p>Why would path-dependency be important in this phase of transition? Because institutions
(such as that of the EEC and EU) have their development constrained by past learning processes
and organizational memories rather than by totally new external impetuses.10 In our case, the
institutional lasting imprint we will look is that of the cold war vision of Eastern Europe (See
Illutration 2 below) that had been totally destroyed by the Soviet domination and which was
therefore to be rebuild and reconstruct from scratch.11 The EEC (soon to become EU) which was
well active by 1989 as an inter-governmental forum, and which in part had just started working with
some Central European countries, was therefore the natural candidate to oversee the re-birth of
‘Europe’, east and west alike, launching a new phase of European integration. This leads us to the
third level of questioning, which has to do with the nature of ‘Europe’, as a political project, and the
consequences of this dominant position acquired in 1989 by ‘Europe’ which was born out of the
western European experience of integration.</p>
      <p>
        What has been the impact of a pre-existent integrated political western Europe for eastern
Europe? ‘Europe’, as a political project born of the creation of the first communities in the 1950s
(European Coal and Steel Community, European Economic Community, EURATOM) was not a
‘neutral’ or ‘technocratic’ project, but was clearly a political project favoured and largely funded by
the USA in the immediate post-WW2 period
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Aldrich 1997)</xref>
        . If one wants therefore to understand
what has been the impact of a pre-existent political Europe (EEC) on the post-1989 Europe, one has
to understand not only the EEC in the 1980s but also the origins of this political Europe, for it
carries in seeds certain traits of the 1950s that might be (or have been) detrimental towards eastern
Europe four or five decades later. It is thus important to understand the biases that ‘Europe’ has
both for eastern Europe and for Europe as a geographical entity. It is puzzling to note, first of all,
how the term “Europe” is now widely referred to as a short cut for a political Europe embodied now
by the EU, yet, when one opens a history book on Europe, very little will be said about this political
Europe, or that it is not so well ‘integrated’ with the history of European states (just to take two
9 On how the USA’s influence over Europe gradually vanished from the 1980s onwards, see
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">Lundestad (2003)</xref>
        .
10 On path-dependency and neo-institutionalism in general, see
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">DiMaggio &amp; Powell (1991</xref>
        : in particular pp. 192ff).
11 One could argue that path-dependency is also important here because the nature of European construction has been to
turn its back to a past of national antagonism and enmity (e.g. France vs Germany) and to construct a positive
collaborative project instead. The period 1989-1991 is another moment where Europe is reluctant to look at a certain
past of rather unorthodox cooperation in the field of military cooperation in the shadow of the NATO and of unpleasant
alliances and flirts with extreme right-wing groups in Western Europe. The so-called GLADIO network of stay-behind
armies in case of Soviet invasion was behind the strategy of tension by western European governments in the 1960s and
1970s.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Ganser (2005)</xref>
        discusses at length these networks. It is interesting to see that these were partly made public
around 1990 and 1991, but passed the Fall 1991, all European governments then refused to participate and comment on
their existence. Can this be another impact of 1989, namely a sort of Flucht nach vorn to avoid to deal with western
European sore experience and concentrate on enlargement instead?
examples, we can quote the work of Tony
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Judt (2005)</xref>
        12 or Harold
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">James (2003)</xref>
        , where the question
of European integration occupies only a tiny portion of their influential works on Europe taken as a
geographical aggregation of nation-states). So there is a discrepancy between the avowed goal of a
political Europe to represent an integrated physical Europe in general and the place granted to this
political project in historical works (and probably in the mind of most Europeans). This discrepancy
is nonetheless interesting for us because it indicates that the political project of ‘Europe’ has been
trying to project the idea of a common European fate as a basis for a full integration.13 It is this
project, that one could qualify as hegemonic since it tends to erase other narratives and tends
towards its own satisfaction via diverse institutional means. ‘Europe’ disposes of many ways and
institutions through which it can diffuse its visions of ‘Europe’. These institutions take various
forms, mostly cognitive ones by playing on European symbols, historical memory, etc. although the
financial aspect is no less important, with massive projects on European identity, history, funded by
the Commission over the last ten or fifteen years. Interestingly, the two declarations by the EEC/EU
dealing explicitly with the need to bolster a common European identity were passed by the EEC in
1973 (Copenhagen Declaration) and in 1983 (Stuttgart Declaration), well before the end of the Cold
War and in a period where ‘Europe’ meant western Europe.14
      </p>
      <p>
        The surge of such literature on a ‘cultural’ Europe is one manifestation of a rather recent
way of conceiving of ‘Europe’ as a place allegedly sharing a same cultural stratum.15 If we take the
representation of European construction in a selection of European textbooks, we can see that there
is a Europeanisation of the historical representation of ‘Europe’. By Europeanisation, we mean that
we are not only witnessing the drafting of a common supra-national curriculum around Europe and
the publication of common European textbooks in France and Germany,16 but also that there is a
convergence in terms of what ‘Europe’ is about: National different views about European
construction gradually vanish and leave place to a common narrative around a cultural Europe
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Challand 2009)</xref>
        . 1989 is presented as an important unfolding moment for ‘Europe’ since it offered
the possibility for eastern Europe to converge and follow the path of western Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following map (Illustration 1) exemplify this occidentalist vision of Eastern Europe
whose future depends on the west: once the Soviet block collapsed, Eastern Europe defined as
‘Balkanised’ will gradually transform (‘Occidentalise’ itself) and thus become an extension of
western Europe (and here of the broader political environment of the post-9/11 era).

15 I am grateful to Chris Amrbruster for observing that this literature on a cultural Europe is also an effect of 1989 and
the ‘return to Europe’. The cultural claim to Europe could be made most easily from CEE on the basis of religion, art,
literature and so on because other political and economic claims to Europeanness across the whole continent were
perceived as weak. Back to a certain idea of ‘slope’.

      <p>Such occidentalist representation mirrors what we have called earlier the lasting imprint of
cold war visions of Eastern Europe and, which, in a way, pre-announces a hegemonic western
European agenda on defining it. Illustration 217 is a political poster of 1952 calling for the creation
of the European Defence Community (a plan later voted down
by the French Parliament in 1954). One sees that unity is
needed to protect against the flood of red blood (a common way
to refer to the communist threat), which tries to break into a
peaceful and blossoming land. Europe is here still a loose
understanding of anti-communism and not uniquely of the Six
first member states (the banners listed here is more than those of
the Six who joined the ECSC in 1951). While there is prosperity
west of this ‘wall’, east of it, there is nothing but a turmoil of
destruction and havoc provoked by the red peril. Let us now see
more into details how the institutionally hegemonic views
favoured by (western) ‘Europe’ tends to be problematic for a
post-1989 Europe.</p>

      <title>3. Projecting Europe</title>
      <p>Projecting the integration of Europe on the basis of a common fate (and we touch here on
the theme of the self-reflective dimension of Europe outlined in the introduction) is problematic in
three senses.</p>

        <title>3.a) Negative Western stereotypes of CEE as a land of emptiness?</title>
        <p>
          First, in this vision of an always expanding (western) political Europe, it is as though eastern
Europe does not have anything to offer to European integration. In the three questions I have raised
above, it is as though eastern Europe was the land of emptiness, with no wealth, knowledge,
institutions, or history upon which a post-1989 Europe could draw resources, only the passive
receptacles of information, good practices and projects to be funded by Brussels (Illustration 1
perfectly matches this distorted reading). But is it the case that eastern Europe was so void of any
internal resources for the project of European integration? Surely, the imposition of Sovietization
and Stalinism had dire consequences in terms of cult of personality, control of the Communist Party
and loss of economic, political or cultural autonomy. Yet, there were diverse attempts within
eastern Europe to remodel socialism with a human face or to propose autonomy with different
forms (certain writings of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Castoriadis (1976)</xref>
          such as the The Hungarian Source are reminders of
internal dynamics that have been overlooked and possibly forgotten in contemporary
historiography), and Yougoslavia was a living example of what we could call a possibly creative
de-alignment throughout the cold war, not to mention Charter 77 and many other non-orthodox
communist underground movements in eastern Europe inspired by the Helsinki conference. Yet, by
portraying eastern Europe as a single entity, one tends to loose these elements and consider only the
common exposure to Soviet totalitarianism, which will not do justice to different national
experiences and legacies. Paul Blokker’s latest work (see his paper for this Conference) is precisely
about retrieving the positive impact of central and eastern European political thought on political
theory in general deserves particular attention against a reducing view on eastern Europe, while
Christian Domnitz has presented elsewhere a typology of rich discourses about Europe that
emerged in the Ostblock in the period 1970-1990
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Domnitz 2008)</xref>
          . This latter work demonstrates
how certain themes of a cultural Europe premised on Christianity or other historical traits have also
emerged in the shadow of communism and highlight some common ground between East and West
of Europe, far from views depicting Eastern Europe as void of possible contribution to Europe at
large.

        <title>3. b) ‘European’ identity and history</title>
        <p>
          The second problem with a certain idea of ‘Europe’ is related to the question of collective
identity (and we will touch here on the necessity of auto-institution on the cognitive level
introduced in the introduction). As known from social sciences, the question of identity is a very
slippery one for it automatically refers to a political project and/or point of view
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">(Wagner 2005)</xref>
          .
With regard to collective identity18 one should always consider the relation of a polity to its present,
future but also to its past. An integrated Europe in the present form is an agglomerate of 27 member
states whose future is to aim at integrating into a single market and, possibly, expand to include new
member states in the future. Even if the stress is put on the acquis communautaire (expressed
generally in legal terms) as a binding common element to the 27 member states, there remains the
dividing element of different historical pasts. We could say here that western and eastern Europes
(if we take these two realms as cohesive entities for the sake of the intellectual exercise) are in a

situation of allochronism, in the sense that they are not in the same position and situation with
regard to their past and do not have the same critical distance to their own history in order to
perform the Vergangenheitsbewältigung that any polity has to perform after traumatic experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Judt perfectly demonstrates how the end of WW2, Soviet rule and the liberation from
USSR’s yoke have provoked serious distortions of the past and have made of the past ‘another
country’
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Judt 2002)</xref>
          . Thus, the imposition of a Soviet totalitarian domination and the destruction of
eastern European’s public spheres, the remoulding of national pasts according to class struggle
lines, the many damnationes memoriae and violent purges imposed during forty years, not to
mention the problematic return of newly rediscovered heroes resisting Sovietization in the last 15
years (ibid.) and the surge of destructive nationalisms since the fall of the wall are all examples that
the past still weigh heavily on eastern European shoulders. Yet, this weigh is difficult to tackle for
not enough time has passed since. Western Europe, on the other hand, has had more time to
confront its past and reconcile certain divide that traumatic experiences such as WW2 or the
political instabilities of the immediate post-war in France, Italy or Germany provoked (yet, this does
not mean that the Bewältigung has been perfect neither completed).
        </p>
        <p>On the question of collective memory and Vergangenheitsbewältigung, the work of Stefan
Troebst (2005. 2006) is most useful for he points to the fragmented themes of memory across
Europe. If the Holocaust is a fundamental point for collective western European memory, other
themes occupy the fore of collective debates in Central and Eastern European countries, changing
from the trauma of foreign occupations and dismemberment by Nazi and then Soviet troops
(Poland, Baltic Countries, e.g.), the Gulag experience, or also the terrible recollection of Holodomor
(the 1932-33 famine in parts of the Soviet Union which struck large parts of Ukraine). Troebst is
correct to state that the 2004 enlargement has revealed the depth of the difference in terms of
collective memory between East and West Europe.19</p>
        <p>Henri Rousso’s article on the dilemma of a European identity (2004) is central for our
discussion of heterochrony. Rousso indicates first that there seems to be a pattern in which
collective occultation and recollection of historical traumas follow one another (amnesia,
anamnesis, etc.). Second, there are also uncompressible times through which historical memory has
to go through before any given large social group is able to accept a commonly shared interpretation
of the collective past: one cannot expect that a society will deal with its past right after the end of a
traumatic experience. Judt’s concluding essay ‘From the House of Dead’ of his Postwar (2005)
shows the timing and length of occultation of certain debates. To come back to the theme that
‘Europe’ is in need of a common memory to reinforce its sense of identity, one should note that if
‘Europe’ is about using western European historical experience as a possible foundation for a
European identity (as a way to go beyond war between nations, and per antonomase a war between
France and Germany), then this historical experience might not be easily accepted by Eastern
Europeans for two reasons. First, because not all Eastern Europeans have the same traumatic past to
confront (Troebst 2006) and because they are in a different phase of their work on memory
(Erinnerungsarbeit) since they have just come out the traumatic Soviet domination for forty years.</p>
        <p>We are now back to the allochronism question. If one sustains that Eastern Europeans are
dragging their feet in acknowledging the centrality of the Holocaust for a common European
identity, this is not just putting them in another time (a la Fabian), but it is also forcing onto them a
certain theme to confront at the expenses of those considered more urgent by the collective memory
19 „Auch der Holocaust-Holodomor-Gedächtnisgraben ist erst im Zuge der EU-Erweiterung sichtbar geworden. Um
Überschwang der Nach-Wende-Zeit waren diese Themen nicht erörtert worden. Die öffentliche Diskussion hat gerade
erst begonnen.” (Troebst 2005).
of this region. It is in this condition that an allochronic statement (‘they are dragging their feet..’)
becomes an alienating statement leading to a situation of heterochrony, that is a situation of
cognitive heteronomy motivated in terms of different time locations.</p>
        <p>
          The literature on Central and Eastern Europe and from Eastern European writers abound of
the theme of allochronism. The idea of a ‘return’ to Europe implies in an indirect way different time
locations and the necessity of ‘touching base’ with the main time of Europe. Some of Czeslaw
Milosz’s writings about his experience as a Pole in western Europe is tainted of connotation of
backwardness and how this self-perception has affected him and co-nationals.20 Note that
allochronism is by no means a feature of western Europeans, but also by eastern Europeans
themselves21. Barbra Törnquist-Plewa notes that “Polish ‘Euro-enthusiasts’ who advocate a speedy
integration into the EU are deeply critical of Polish society and accuse it of being conservative,
limited, fanatically religious, nationalistic, burdened with the heritage of the past and immature.”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">(Törnquist-Plewa 2002: 237)</xref>
          . The fact that allochronic trope can at times become heterochrony is
exemplified in the following quote of Janis Peters, Chairman of the Writers’ Union of the Latvian
Republic and Latvian writer answering a comment in 1989 about Russians: “The proposition that
the Russians are worse off is no consolation for the Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians, or a reason
for waiting for a deteriorating situation also in the Baltic area. Why compare us with less developed
regions? Compare us instead with Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark” (quoted in Karlsson
2002: 182). Here clearly the writer expresses the view that the Baltic countries resent being ascribed
to a backward situation and would prefer to choose to be compared and be part of the more
advanced Scandinavian club.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heterochrony is therefore a serious hurdle in the ideational convergence of self-perceptions
as ‘Europeans’ by Eastern Europeans. This impression for Central and East Europe that a certain
past and certain type of Erinnerungsarbeit that provide significance mostly to western Europeans
are leading Eastern Europeans to a certain form of resentment towards ‘Europe’.22 Törnquist-Plewa
stresses in the Polish case that “identification with Europe is made difficult by the fact that Poles do
not feel accepted by those they want to identify with”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">(Törnquist-Plewa 2002: 239)</xref>
          . This problem
can hardly be written off for large parts of Eastern Europe which has suffered from external power
(Fremdherrschaft) and it is extremely important to acknowledge this problem. So, while Troebst is
right in pointing to a variety of traumas that Europeans have to confront, one should also think of
the timing of trauma elaboration and Erinnerungsarbeit. One cannot therefore expect, e.g.,
Estonians to recognize the centrality of Holocaust for a European memory, when it is still facing
burning questions about the past of Soviet occupation and Russification policies
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref21">(Kattago 2008a)</xref>
          and has become (again) independent ‘not even’ twenty years ago. Any society should therefore
have the right, on a cognitive level, to say: “Holocaust, or Holodomor, is not the central worry for
us now” and assert its own priority in terms of collective memory, if such statements are
accompanied by a corollary moral obligation to acknowledge the suffering of others. If not, there is
an imposition from outside23 of a given memory agenda that prevents full autonomy for that
society. As put by the Estonian scholar Siobhan Kattago (2008b), there should be, between eastern
and western Europe an ‘agreement to disagree’ on memory and cultural identity.
20 See some quotes in Törnquist-Plewa (2002: 232ff)
21 This echoes the existence of oriental ‘Orientalists’ (a la Said) described in the contect of the Middle East by Sadiki
(2004: 180ff). Note that these oriental orientalists or in our case Eastern European allochronists are an indirect witness
of a profound asymmetrical relations between two polities.
22 Similarly, in Turkey, many people are becoming increasingly Euro-skeptic in part for the reasons stated here.
23 This is not to say that foreigners should have no say in the public debates about collective history and memory of
another country. At times it can be salutary, if one think of the role of Paxton for France to eventually confront its
Vichy past.

        <title>3. c) Europe as a western European experience</title>
        <p>
          The third and final problem with a certain projection about the integration of Europe on lies
in forcing the possibility of a common fate (Schicksalsgemeinschaft) for the whole of Europe. If this
is done too rigidly, and by not taking into consideration the fact that by ‘European’ experience we
speak in reality of western Europe’s historical experience, then it will be difficult for Eastern
Europeans to accept a new imposition of a hegemonic past
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Judt 2002)</xref>
          . Indeed, there are some
biases on the history of European integration that are the result of the context of the nascent Cold
War which witnessed the birth of the first European institutions that still loom over certain debates
and themes. Looking at the history of European integration through the prism of the Cold War, as
done by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Messenger (2006)</xref>
          is a good reminder (against the euphoria of federalist historiography24)
of the serious security considerations at stake in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the time where the
first European communities were founded. What such history does not tell us really is that the
context of Cold War served also an ‘imaginary war’, to take the phrase of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Kaldor (1990)</xref>
          where the
enemy was not so much the external ‘other’ (eastern European communism, or Stalinism as it was
frequently described) but the internal ‘other’, namely the opposition of the western European
communists in western Europe (or the red threat in the USA of the McCarthy era). The consequence
of this was that for a few decades the discourse of the threat of the Soviets and of Stalinism (which
was tied to the first years of the European communities) served the purpose of taming part of the
political forces in the Europe of the Six (communist parties and trade unions in particular),
undermining thus the possibility of representing the construction of a new Europe as a political
project of all its citizens, and even in some cases alienating some segments of the population from
supporting the European cause.25 So one consequence of the brandishing of external other’s threat
for ‘Europe’ with a view on internal affairs was that it turned effectively this external other into a
forgotten other of Europe, in the sense that it reinforced the view that Eastern Europe was totally
equated with threat and no other potential constitutive elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a parallel way, and to come back to current times, one could say that a political Europe
ought to be careful when representing itself as a positive project offering equal opportunity for all in
its drive to open up new horizons for eastern Europeans and integrate into (western) Europe. After
all, there is a sense of a Europe with two speeds, on the one hand, one within the Euro-zone and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref21 ref7">(at
least until to the first days of 2008)</xref>
          with a differentiated access to mobility (with the Schengen area)
and a reality of a prosperous western Europe and, on the other hand, still devastated socio-economic
landscapes of the former eastern block. The contrast between the ‘old’ and ‘new’ Länder in
Germany is a cruel reminder of this two-speed Europe. So to take up again the image of the Cold
War, it is one thing to remind us of the historical origins of ‘Europe’, but another are the
longlasting consequences of the Cold War: to a certain degree, European integration of eastern Europe
has overlapped with the military expansion of NATO, the history of ‘Europe’ is mostly that of a
western Christian (be it Catholic or Protestant) Europe (at the expenses of an Orthodox and also
from a Muslim Europe). Current debates about civil society, economic development, or standards of
living still echo some of the debates of the 1950s about democracy and development (thinking back
on
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">Lipset’s Political Man (1960</xref>
          ), or his ‘Requisites to Democracy’ (1959), or
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Rostow’s
Noncommunist Manifesto (1960</xref>
          ), etc.). The Cold War might be over in facts, but ‘Europe’ might still
carry along some of its scoria (Laqueur’s Last days of Europe: Epitaph for an old continent ought
to be read critically in this light, I think). It would instead be interesting to explore, in the line of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">Domnitz (2008)</xref>
          , another type of historiography that looks at the point of view of the ‘other’, in this
case Eastern European themselves, that considers dissident intra-east European points of view both
of the past and current times, or that sheds new lights on the continuing tensions within Eastern

riots in Hungary to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1956 stand off, a proof of a continuing
malaise despite a ‘successful’ transition, while the conflict over the Soviet War Memorial in Tallinn

      <title>4. A final word: The Other of Europe and Heterochrony</title>
      <p>This paper is a call to consider eastern Europe not simply as the void ‘other’ of (western)
Europe by 1989 and to a-void western-euro-centrism at large when looking at European integration
and 1989. Indeed when the presence of external ‘others’ loom over certain political debates or serve
as a marker of differentiation between large social groups, this is often done at the expenses of a
sound discussion of each other’s points of view and all too often serve only emotional purposes
(one of which can be a repli identitaire fed by collective resentment) and lead to essentalisations
both of the internal content of what ‘Europe’ is about (in terms of borders, culture, identity, or
memory), and about its ‘others’—past and present ones.26</p>
      <p>Since Eastern Europe is the geographical space from which the ‘other’ of Stalinism and
communism threatened the Europe of the Six in the 1950s, one should examine the relations
between a political Europe and Eastern Europe also in this light and with great attention. Surely
Eastern Europe no longer represents such an ‘other’ for a political Europe, but lasting imprints of
the cold war period and mental maps (as shown in Ill. 2 and its contemporary version in Ill. 1)
might render this work difficult. Now that ‘Europe’ is made of 27 member states, surely the centre
of gravity of a common political Europe has moved eastwards, a fact that one could clearly perceive
in the latest round of harsh negotiations (especially from Poland who tries to maximize its full
membership into the EU and does not hesitate to behave, at times, in an arrogant manner since it is
now part of the club) around the Treaty of Lisbon signed in December 2007. Yet, when it comes to
writing the history of Europe or the description of ‘Europe’ as a cultural entity, the centre of gravity
probably still has to be re-adjusted accordingly, giving more voice and space to eastern European
experiences and projects. If not, one risks creating artificial binaries rendering ideational
convergence around the EU impossible.</p>
      <p>
        Such binary divides can also be found in the self-reflective dimensions of Europe when a
certain type of occidentalist literature contributes to otherize through a variety of means and tropes
about Central and Eastern European societies. One dimension of this contemporary ‘otherization’
process that we have discussed in this paper and which is, in our view, understudied, is the question
of allochronism and this tendency to ascribe groups to different time locations. We have argued that
the capacity of auto-institution on the cognitive level is as important for the viability of the
European project as structural convergence around the EU has been and is for the 12 new member
states. This capacity of auto-institution for Eastern European societies is currently most vividly
necessary on the field of Erinnerungsarbeit, Vergangenheitsbewältigung and collective memory
around the question of a ‘cultural Europe’. If not Eastern European societies feel that they are
26 For some preliminary conclusion on the study of Islam and Turkey as the ‘other’ of Europe, see
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Challand (2008)</xref>
        . For
a plea to be more inclusive about the nature and content of ‘Europe’ see Shore ( 2000: 63):
“[…] Creating the ‘European identity’, as depicted in EU discourse, entails a degree of exclusion of the Other. […]
‘European identity tends to become meaningful only when contrasted to that which is not Europe. As Europe
consolidates and converges, and as the barriers between European nation-states are eliminated, so the boundaries
separating Europe from its Third World ‘Others’ have intensified. […] The problem with this approach to identity is its
absolutism: its failure to recognise cultures as composite and hybrid entities.”
placed in a situation of heterochrony, this condition might lead to more than ‘mere’ ideational
divergence, but possibly outright political standoff between different parties. Without referring to
the question of heterochrony, the situation that Troebst describes about the impasse around the
creation of a European Network of Memory and Solidarity (Troebst 2007) between Germany and
Poland is, in part, close to one of heterochrony and where the current situation is an effective end to
transnational collaboration. Difficult in these circumstances to envisage further ‘integration’ and
larger debates about Europe as a cultural project. Going back to a better understanding of 1989
might instead lay the path of a richer and more diverse understanding of what constitutes Europe,
East and West.
