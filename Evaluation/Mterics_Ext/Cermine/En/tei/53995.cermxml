          <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
          <p>hronic wounds can be seen as lesions of difficult healing and of frequent
recurrence, usually from multiple systemic problems.1 Usually they are not seen as a
pressing public health problem, although representing a common, complex and costly
condition2, since interfere with several of the individual life of the components, such as
mobility, sleep and rest, and cause stress, anxiety, severe pain and persistent in many
cases.1-2 They are of multifactorial etiology, such as venous disease, arterial, diabetic
neuropathy, cancer, and metabolic, hematologic and infectious and parasitic diseases.3</p>
          <p>Among the above mentioned etiologies, there are the venous ulcers, conceptually
defined as a tissue loss in the extremities due to a vascular dysfunction4,5, due to a failure
in valvular6 system or due to factors such as venous obstruction caused by varicose veins,
evil valve formation, venous hypertension, venous occlusion by clot causing venous
hypertension and occasioning the ulcer of this etiology.3 The most common are chronic leg
ulcers3, and can reach a rate of 80% and may affect from youth to old age.7</p>
          <p>International studies indicate that the occurrence of venous ulcers increases with
age.2,8 Some previous studies in Brazil showed an association of venous ulcers with low
income and education9,10, single and recurring lesions3,7,11 and presence of pain process.10
However, we can see some little statistical data on the prevalence of this type of ulcer in
the country and in different regions, as well as the factors associated with the history of the
wound and its treatment, which implies the underestimation of the problem.</p>
          <p>Care for individuals with this type of problem, led by nurses and developed in
community clinics, as has been strongly supported in the UK, since the late 90's.2 A similar
project developed in London showed that before and after a 12-week audit this type
service, of leg ulcers healing rates improved from 22% to 69% with the new service.12 In
Brazil, the nurse integrates stomatherapy teams, whether in outpatient or hospital network,
and has different functions ranging from assessment injuries and execution of dressing as
well as the development of educational activities and the realization of referrals.7</p>
          <p>The venous leg ulcers constitute an important psychosocial burden, financial and in
terms of morbidity for their patients and for health services and the knowledge of its
prevalence and associated factors can contribute to a better nursing care and
multidisciplinary. Thus, this study aimed to estimating the prevalence of venous leg ulcers
among adults treated at the Victoria da Conquista Health Centre - BA and identify
sociodemographic factors, health and wound characteristics and its treatment associated
with this event.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-1-2-2">
          <title>METHOD</title>
          <p>This article comes from a larger study called the "characteristics of patients with
lower limb ulcers treated at a health center in the countryside of Bahia, 2011," in which
multiple health outcomes were investigated.</p>
          <p>There was conducted in a Health Center (CS) located in the city of Vitoria da
Conquista, in the Southwest of Bahia. This is the only Municipal outpatient specialized and
reference to patients with chronic lesions, consisting of a multidisciplinary team, among
them, a medical specialist, nurses and nursing technicians. There were registered in the
service during the period of data collection about 800 patients, this number refers to both
individuals followed by the specialized service, and by individuals who perform episodic
contacts with the same for the execution of dressing less complex or withdrawal points.
Health Center meets from patients with chronic ulcers or difficult treatment referred from
the Family Health Units and other health centers, as well as patients from spontaneous
demand. Patients with higher morbidity or complications of other comorbidities such as
diabetes mellitus are referred to hospitals.</p>
          <p>The sample was non-probabilistic, random and without repetition, and for obtaining
were approached all eligible patients in the study of the occurrence period (January to
March 2011) that met the following criteria: patients had lower limb ulcers, over 18 years
old, in attendance in CS the dressing rooms in the period of data collection. There were
excluded those with ulcers in another part of the body other than the lower limbs and those
who were not in the CS to perform curative but due to other reasons.</p>
          <p>The interviews were conducted by researchers in every day and functioning of the
service hours and occurred at the time that individuals awaiting service, when the
impossibility of doing so in the same day, a new schedule is made for the nearest day for
attendance at the CS, a fact that happened to one individual. Thus, all 43 individuals
addressed expressly agreed to participating in the study by signing the Informed Consent
Form (ICF) and the refusal rate was zero.</p>
          <p>Just prior to data collection a pre-test was conducted in order to verifying
instrument feasibility and conditions for conducting research. The individuals interviewed in
this phase were not included in the final study sample.</p>
          <p>To obtaining data we used a structured form; it contained sociodemographic
variables (gender, age, education, marital status, color/race, income, living arrangements
and place of residence); health variables: (hours of sleep per night, physical mobility, pain,
type 2 diabetes, hypertension and chronic venous insufficiency); and variables on the
history and treatment of the wound: (wound start time, presence of wound recurrence,
number of wounds, frequency of exchange of toppings and place of the healing).</p>
          <p>The above variables were used as potential factors associated with venous ulcers.</p>
          <p>The etiological hypothesis of the wound, the dependent variable in this study was obtained
through self-report and dichotomized as venous ulcers and not venous ulcers. Although some
studies have been based on clinical judgment of the lower limbs and established a set of
clinical indicators for classification of venous ulcers, we decided to using the self-report
validated by the diagnostics of medical records, since there was no difference between this
and the diagnosis prior.</p>
          <p>There were interviewed 43 people, and from this total there was excluded 1 (2,32%)
individual who did not answer the question on the etiological hypothesis of the wound and
which was not found diagnosis in the medical record.</p>
          <p>The analytical plan included the estimation of the prevalence of types of ulcers
stratified by sex and for all individuals, using both descriptive statistical procedures. For the
analysis of associated factors (sociodemographic variables, health and variables related to
the history and treatment of the wound) the venous ulcers, the chi-square test of Pearson
or Fisher exact tests were performed. Were considered statistically significant differences
less than or equal to 5% (p = 0,05). The data collected was used Epi Info software version
3.5.3 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA).</p>
          <p>The research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Municipal Health
Secretariat of Vitoria da Conquista – BA; and by the Research Ethics Committee of the State
University of Southwest Bahia (UESB), under Opinion No 199/2010 and CAAE:
0033.0.45400010. All individuals have expressed agreement with the free and informed consent (IC) and
signed it.</p>

          <title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
          <p>A prevalence of 83,3% of venous ulcers and 17,7% of non-venous ulcers (15,3% of
neurotrophic ulcers and 2,4% of traumatic ulcers) for the general population was found.
When stratified by gender, we identified a higher prevalence of venous ulcers among
women (95,5%) and the lowest prevalence of ulcers in this other sex too (4,5%) compared
with men (FIGURE 1).</p>

&amp;Chi-square; * Fischer's exact</p>
        <p>The prevalence of venous ulcers among individuals analyzed in this study was of great
magnitude, resembling that found in the United States, where 80% of leg ulcers are due to
rise of venous ulcers 6, similar to that found in Juiz de Fora - MG (79%)5 and less than that
found in Goiania, whose prevalence was 61%. 13 The lower prevalence of venous ulcers in
Goiania may be related to the fact that they have been clinically evaluated, besides the
patients were recruited in Basic Units of dressing rooms of Health13, in contrast to the
present study which the classification of ulcers was based on self-report and by checking
on records and performed in a specialized service and reference in the treatment of
wounds.</p>
        <p>The major predominance of venous ulcers in females corroborates with two studies in
Minas Gerais5,14, and may reflect hormonal and gestational aspects involved in this
susceptibility, and socio-cultural aspects that make women seek more health services
men15. However, the predominance in males also have a tendency is observed in some
regional studies7,9 confirming that this situation is not only characteristic of women.</p>
        <p>When analyzing the factors associated with venous ulcers, it was observed that some
sociodemographic and health characteristics may be contributing to the construction of
the profile of patients affected by this type of ulcers. Among the sociodemographic
factors, beyond sex, family arrangement was the only one that remained associated with
venous ulcers. Higher prevalence of this disease in women has also been mentioned in
other studies.5,8,14 A plausible explanations for the association between living together and
the presence of venous ulcers may be related to greater responsibility in caring for the
family and housework14, and therefore less time for self-care, however, this association
needs further investigation.</p>
        <p>Among the surveyed morbidity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic venous
insufficiency constitute relevant associations before countless other factors that may
influence the onset of venous ulcers and depict the importance of both the control as the
treatment of these morbidities. Higher proportion of patients with chronic venous
insufficiency was found among those who had venous ulcers in this study, which confirms
previous study which showed that venous ulcers match 70-90% of all leg ulcers16. The
chronic venous insufficiency can bring aesthetic and functional complications and its most
exuberant manifestation venosa6 ulcer. It is engaged with the increase in venous pressure,
which damages the hair and make it more permeable, allowing the exit of several
molecules, generating eczema caused by the degradation of hemoglobin; edema due to the
accumulation of interstitial fluid, hyperpigmentation and lipodermatosclerosis.6,15 In those
circumstances, a venous ulcer can be developed either using a light trauma, such as due to
a collision with a mobile, or even spontaneously.1,17</p>
        <p>Regarding diabetes mellitus, its absence was associated with higher prevalence of
venous ulcers. It is important reporting that these findings are consistent with the low
frequency of venous ulcers due to causes such as diabetes.5 This finding may also be partly
attributed due to the sample size. In line with the above, about 20% of diabetic patients
develop lower limb ulcers at some point in their lives and their development may be
associated with both neuropathic and vascular changes.18 Diabetic neuropathy, chronic
complication of this disease, can lead the decrease or loss of tactile, thermal, painful,
anhidrosis and atrophy of various peripheral regions of the body, due to autonomic nervous
impairment and motor18. In vascular disorders, atherosclerosis is responsible for the
pathophysiological process of obstruction and arterial ischemia.17,18</p>
        <p>The association between the occurrence of pain and the presence of venous ulcers is
well established and is in agreement with other studies.19,20 The painful component can
represent as well as an exacerbation of the inflammatory phase and delay the healing
process21, an important factor actor in the quality of life of individuals with venous
ulcers.10,16</p>
        <p>Regarding the history of the wounds, the highest prevalence of individuals with
venous ulcers were found among those who had more than 10 years of start of the first ulcer
and among those who had recurrence of the wound, which denotes a situation of chronic
wounds, these findings also indicated in other studies.9,22,23 This situation can still picture a
greater demand for health services both with regard to the mobilization of human, material
and structural as well as the impact this has on the quality of life of individuals affected,
requiring greater health care.7 Nevertheless, the fact of the individuals come from a
referral center for the treatment of wounds, may represent greater complexity of the
lesions, explaining in part the results.</p>
        <p>It is noteworthy that, with regard to the treatment to the healing of venous ulcers
and improves venous return, it is recommended that it should be provided by doctors,
nurses and other professionals with the joint participation of the patient, with
compression therapy one of the pillars,6,15 with a view to reducing edema and venous
stasis.7 Yet, regarding the treatment of venous ulcers, although not statistically
significant, most patients reported using the Health Center and the home to carry out the
roofing trade. Like most of venous ulcers can recur in up to 70% of cases3,7, and all the
cases that had relapsed venous ulcers in this study, the use of the Health Center and the
household as care environments may reflect this need to equip the individuals’ conditions
and knowledge to receive care and self-care. However, it is known that the
decentralization of care for the individual to perform the dressing in his home, it involves
from the availability of staff to conduct the training of customers, to the receptivity of the
same, will, and, above all, in preparation to realize it, and also permeating the discussions
on health about the cost-effectiveness of clean and sterile techniques, the use of
antiseptics and frequency of exchanges of coverage depending on the needs of each wound
and their vectors.</p>
        <p>Because they are venous ulcers so prevalent in the analyzed context, they require
expensive and prolonged treatment and have shocked the quality of life of their patients, it
is urgent that health services are prepared for the effective care of this clientele and that

          <title>CONCLUSION</title>
          <p>The results showed that venous ulcers are common health problems among adults in
ascribed rated service and the associated factors such as gender, living arrangements, type
2 diabetes mellitus, chronic venous insufficiency, pain and time of beginning of the first
ulcer are consistently observed at other national-scale studies. These findings are
configured as input for the preparation of planning, prevention and treatment relevant to
this subject in order to enhancing the chances of successful treatment, contributing to the
reduction of recidivism, healing without complications, reduced spending improving the
health and quality of life.</p>
          <p>However, a limitation highlights the difficulty of cross-sectional studies in
establishing temporal relationship, because of the exposure and the outcomes are measured
simultaneously. The fact that the response variable have been based on self-report,
although less accurate than the clinical evaluation of the ulcer, had the advantage of being
inexpensive and more likely to be replicated with large samples.</p>
          <p>In this light, there is the importance of further research in different scenarios and
with more representative samples in order to improving national records about venous
ulcers and other etiologies and enable strategies to ensuring better health care based on
scientific evidences and substantial clinics.</p>
