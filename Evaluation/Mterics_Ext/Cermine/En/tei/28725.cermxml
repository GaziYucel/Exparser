        <p>»Datenintegration und Datenkonsolidierung von administrativen Daten aus unterschiedlichen Quellen am Beispiel von Daten zum deutschen Arbeitsmarkt«. This article introduces the data integration and consolidation process of the research data base of the Institute for Employment Research. The data are process generated data and stem from various, autonomous administrative processes. This fact implies that there are manifold inconsistencies between the data from the different data sources. This opens up the methodological problem of a successful consolidation of inconsistencies. Two contrarian strategies to handle this methodological problem are discussed and the solution in the IAB-data base is presented.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Process-produced micro data today play an important role in research in social
science
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(cf. Jacobebbinghaus 2007)</xref>
        . They are suitable for a broad range of
research objects like research on organizations, administrative processes,
employment biographies or special sub-population in a society
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref10 ref2 ref3 ref4 ref8 ref9">(cf. Scheuch 1977:
22 et sqq.; Bick, Mann, Müller 1984; Schmähl, Fachinger 1994: 179 et sqq.;
Bick, Müller 2002: 230; Wallgren 2007: 4)</xref>
        . Process produced data are defined
as data that are generated by diverse (administrative) processes and represent a
documentation of different actions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(cf. Scheuch 1977: 25)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>The linkage between the administrative process and the data it generates
implies that process-produced data necessarily are limited to a specific purpose. In
order to overcome these natural limitations in the process generated data a
combination of data from different data sources (and administrative processes)
is necessary. At a first glance this data integration and consolidation process
might look similar and typical for the development of research datasets. But
using and preparing process-produced data stemming from large administrative
processes poses some specific problems that are more complex those in data
from smaller data sources.</p>
      <p>So this article deals with data integration and data consolidation in general,
but also depicts specific problems of the integration of large process generated
datasets. In the following we want to present as an example the research data
genesis of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) data base that
transforms and integrates data originating on the operational level of the appropriate
administrative process of the Federal Employment Agency (BA) to datasets
that are well fitted for research.</p>
      <p>The above mentioned problems are not only technical but also
methodological problems. The integration of data stemming in case of the IAB data from at
least four different fields of administrative processes, two different institutions
and, coming with that, minimum four different operational IT-systems1 requires
a dealing with inconsistencies in the data. So the methodological problem of
how to deal with not integrated and inconsistent process generated data when
creating a integrated research data base will be discussed and two diverging
solutions will be presented.</p>
      <p>
        All this information high lightens the background of the IAB data base and
provides necessary knowledge for the usage of process produced data in
general and especially the IAB research data, contributing to a better understanding
of the data and data production process as it is proposed by Bick and Müller
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(1984: 145; cf. Wallgren 2007)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Before describing the data generation and the resulting problems the IAB
research data base will be presented to ensure a better understanding of the
following problems. This integrated research data base can serve as an example
for integrated process data bases of various sources and fields.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>2. Data Base of the Case Study: The IAB data</title>
      <p>The IAB research data base consists in general of four different data sources
and administrative processes covering the four main fields of the German labor
market. These four fields are (a) employment, (b) job-search, (c)
unemployment benefit recipience (unemployment insurance and basic income support)
and (d) active labor market policies. The data are collected in different and
autonomous operational IT-systems.
1 In fact many more operational IT-systems were and currently are in use by the BA to
administer and register process data, but we use in this article only the three main ones used
for BA-based research data.</p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>2.1 General Problems Arising When Integrating Data</title>
        <p>In a first step the data of each data source are consolidated and for each data
source a research data product is generated. In a second step these different
data sources are integrated to one data set. This large and comprehensive
research data base is called the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB). In the
last years many analyses of a broad range of aspects of the German labor
market were based on the IEB. For more details on the IEB and the access to this
data set, see Jacobebbinghaus 2007.</p>
        <p>For a broader understanding of the presented IAB-data the four main data
sources will be briefly introduced. Job-seeking data, unemployment benefit
recipient data and data on measures of active labor market policy programs
stem from the Federal Employment Agency itself and its operational
ITsystems. These data are produced in the appropriate administrative processes.
They are registered on the operational level in the belonging IT-system and
then stored in the central pool of BA-business data. This data pool provides the
data which are transformed and integrated by the IAB in order to build up its
research data base.</p>
        <p>In this process a whole set of problems can arise that also can be found in
many other data integration processes. Some important problems are discussed
in the following:
- Inconsistent information for one person: It is important to notice that there
is nearly no cross-validation of information between the different
operational IT-systems during the registration process. Therefore inconsistent
information for one person (e.g. differences in nationality) can be registered.
- Identifier (ID) of a person: A second dimension of the autonomy of the
different IT-systems is related to the identifier (ID) of a person. Different
IT-systems and administrative processes do have different identifiers so that
one person may have two or more identifiers.
- Data Structure: In principle the data structure in all data sources is similar.</p>
        <p>All the data are spell data. But coverage and composition of these spell data
differs between the data sources. For example a spell in the data coming
from the social insurance system maximal covers one year, whereas spells
stemming from the unemployment benefit recipient system might be much
longer.
- Time-Span Covered: The maximum time span covered in the data depends
on the underlying administrative process. Some data sources already exist
for decades, reaching back to the 1970s. This results in manifold problems
that can cause breaches in the long time-series, like changes in legislation or
the IT-systems, etc.
- Different Target Populations: The administrative processes providing the
data are focussed on their special purpose and therefore target a specific
group of persons. This implies that only information relevant for that
purpose are registered and even further, that the meaning of the information is
collected purpose-dependent. Therefore in the process generated data
seemingly similar attributes might have different, process dependent values and
meanings.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>2.2 Data Structure</title>
        <p>The three BA-related data sources use the BA-client-number (KNR) as the
main identifier for a person. The data consist of spell data, which means
individual, daily and historical information, that show the different states of
information over time. Included are client characteristics and different
administrative purpose dependent information (e.g. target job in job-seeking information,
amount of unemployment benefits per time period in unemployment benefit
recipience, etc.).</p>
        <p>In the case of job-seeking data this means individual, daily and historical
information covering the time period since 2000 up to today, the different states
of job-search and information about personal attributes like sex, date of birth,
reasons for job-search, target job, etc.</p>
        <p>Data stemming from the administration of active labor market policy
programs also consist of individual, daily and historical information covering the
time period since 2000 up to today. Information about personal attributes like
sex, date of birth and information about the participation in the measure of
active labor market policy is provided (e.g. duration of participation, outcome,
etc.). Nearly all existing measures of active labor market policy since 1999 are
covered in the data.</p>
        <p>A significant longer time series can be found in the unemployment benefit
recipient data. Here the spell data go back to 1975, so that more than 30 years
are covered. The data show information about the unemployment insurance
system. This means that only persons that were employed for a certain amount
of time before becoming unemployed can be found in the data. The data show
on a daily basis client characteristics, information about benefit recipience (e.g.
amount of transfer per period), reasons for exiting the unemployment benefit
recipient system and much more.</p>
        <p>The youngest data source is the basic income support system data, which
was founded by the introduction of the Social Code 2 (SGB II) in 2005. Since
then there is a second kind of benefit recipience information coming from the
administrative procedures of the basic income support system. The information
found here is similar to the information in the unemployment benefit recipient
data, but does have another target population and a different benefit logic – this
system is a means-tested benefit system and in most cases it is conjointly
administered by the BA and the municipalities.</p>
        <p>Beside these data coming more or less from BA related processes, there is
another large data source stemming from a completely different institution. The
IAB hosts German employment data coming from the social insurance system.
So this data shows social insured employment in Germany, but no
selfemployment and no civil servants. It is important to notice that these data are
produced by completely different institutions, institutions that are completely
unrelated to the BA (see also Meyer, Mika and Thorvaldsen, in this Special
Issue). The pension and health insurance institutions therefore use their own
person identifier, the social security number. Analog to the unemployment
benefit recipient data, the employment data start in 1975 and today end in
2007. The data consist of spell data, providing daily, historical and individual
information about employment. Available information are personal
characteristics, employment times, remuneration, occupation, etc.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>3. Data Generation and Institutional Bias</title>
        <p>
          After the brief introduction of the most important parts of the IAB research
data base, a closer look to the data generation process is necessary. This is
essential, because these data, used for social research, are produced in a
“foreign” – non scientific – context. The research data in this understanding
represent a secondary usage of data that are collected for administrative purposes.
Therefore administrative data being used as a research data source represent a
data source of unobtrusive measures (cf. Best 2003: 112). To understand the
research potentials and risks in the data background knowledge about the data
generation process, situation and setting is required. Also important is
knowledge about the administrative processes in which the data are collected
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref10 ref2 ref3">(cf.
Bick, Müller 1984: 123; cf. Wallgren 2007: 180)</xref>
          . In order to give here a short
impression of such background knowledge the genesis of the research data
from the operation registration to the finished research data set will be outlined.
Figure 1 shows the way from operational level to the research data using
jobseeking data as example.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first step of the process the job-seeker communicates with the
BAagent in the placement service. The job-seeker is obliged to give information to
the agent and these are only information relevant for the administrative process
of job-placement. Some information are registered in the face-to-face situation
of agent and client, so that the agent simultaneously has to communicate with
the client and register data in the operational IT-system - and all that possibly
under time pressure. This stressful situation has some implications on data
quality. There might be some errors in the registered information and
information more important for the placement process (e.g. occupational information)
will be registered and checked priorly.2
2 This is a general factor in administrative data. Process produced research data always are
determined by the specific administrative system upon there are based
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(cf. Wallgren 2007:
176)</xref>
          .
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-4">
        <title>3.1 Lack of Cross-Consolidation</title>
        <p>Another important point to notice is, that the IT-system is directly linked to the
appropriate administrative process. So information concerning job-search is
registered in the job-search IT-system (called VerBIS), information for the
benefit recipience process in the benefit recipient IT-system. As mentioned
above, there is nearly no validation of information by cross-checks between the
different autonomous IT-systems.</p>
        <p>After the registration and storage in the operational IT-systems some
information is transferred to the central pool of BA business data. The pool centrally
stores important data from the operational IT-systems and therefore includes
data from all operational IT-systems of the BA plus some more selected data
like employment data. It is important to notice, that the data are stored
centrally, but are not integrated.</p>
        <p>This data pool provides the base data used for creating the IAB data
products. The data integration and consolidation work in order to build up the
research data base is done by the IAB itself. The following graphic shows this
explicitly:</p>
        <p>In this picture the pillar principle in the BA-data is made visible. The
different administrative processes have appropriate operational IT-systems that work
more or less autonomous. In the database of the BA the data are centrally
stored but not integrated. This step is done by the IAB when creating an
integrated person centered database. Some more steps in the IAB data production
process are not illustrated above, but it should be clear that our methodological
problem of dealing with inconsistent information has be solved before an
integrated research data base can be built up.</p>
        <p>In the next part three typical data problems will be presented and some
examples for solutions are given:
1) The problem of the identification and integration of a person in the data will
be illustrated.
2) Possibilities of consolidation of inconsistent information will be presented.
3) Some remarks about the problems resulting from long time series data will
be made.
4. Integration and Consolidation of Data on a Single Person
As shown above the IAB integrates data from different sources. With that
integration comes the need for consolidating manifold inconsistencies in the
data. For example a person might have different nationalities at the same point
of time in data source A and data source B.</p>
        <p>A precondition for the dealing with inconsistent information is the
identification of a comprehensive person. Only if one knows that person A in data
source A is the same person as person B in data source B a consolidation of
information between both data sources can be done.</p>
        <p>So the first thing to be done is that person identification. Now why should
that be a problem? As already mentioned different IT-systems use different
person identifiers. We have at least two identifiers per person – the BA-client
number (KNR) and the social security number (VSNR). In both cases it is
possible that one person has more than one of those identifiers.
1) BA-Client Number (Kundennummer, KNR): Until 2003 the BA-client
number was decentrally assigned by the different BA-agencies. Each agency of
the BA (more than 270 in Germany) assigned its own number after a person
entered the administrative process. That means that after changing the
agency because of moving to another city a new number was assigned. A new
number also was assigned if a client after a longer period of absence could
not remember his old number and told the agent that he didn't have a
BAclient number. Another factor is the above mentioned stressfull registration
procedure. In this situation an already assigned BA-client number might be
registered incorrect. All these factors lead to the fact that a person might
have more than one BA-client number, either historically or even at the same
point of time. Another identification problem can be found in the historical
BA-data. Before 2005 more identifiers existed along with the BA-client
number. An example later on used is the BA-registration number (EGNR).
2) Social Security Number (Versicherungsnummer, VSNR): The second major
person identifier comes with the employment data. The social security
number is assigned by the pension insurance. For each person that enters an
employment that is covered by the social insurance system the pension
insurance assigns a stable identifier that should not change over the life course.
But here it is possible too that a person has more than one number.</p>
        <p>All these problems result in the need for a stable, consistent and
comprehensive person identifier in the integrated IAB data. There are two possible
strategies to create that identifier:
1) Known relations between the different identifiers in the BA data can be
used. By combining the already known related identifiers one person can be
identified as being one person in the different data sources.
2) Known personal attributes like name, first name, date of birth and sex are
matched. If that matching brings a good degree of accordance it is plausible
that a person in two data sources actually is the same person.</p>
        <p>In the case of the IAB data both possibilities are used and will be briefly
outlined here.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-5">
        <title>4.1 Identifying and Checking Connections</title>
        <p>In a first step all the given identifiers in the data are systematically checked for
connections. This is possible because in the different IT-systems along with the
primary ID of that operational IT-system other IDs are registered as secondary
information. An example for this are the job-seeking data. Here the primary
identifier is the BA-client number (KNR), but during the administrative process
the social security number (VSNR) is registered as well as a secondary
attribute. This results in relations between the different identifiers in different data
sources. By systematically checking these connected information a person and
its different IDs can be identified.</p>
        <p>The second step for identifying a comprehensive person is matching four
personal attributes and look for the accordance in that match. The second step
is possible because of a (redundant) storage of this information in different
ITsystems. The four already described personal attributes can be found in the
different data sources. And this step is necessary for avoiding wrong mergers
of persons.</p>
        <p>The following example with fictive data in two tables makes this
identification process transparent. The fictive example consists of data of two persons
who are married. The data used are stored in two central table, the
BA-ClientHistory-Table and the BA-Client-Table. The identification process uses
combined information from both table. The example consists of three steps: First
related identifiers in table 1 are combined, second the related identifiers in table
1 are combined with identifiers in table 2 and third the proposed combination
of identifiers are validated by matching personal attributes. In the end the two
persons are comprehensively identified.</p>
        <p>The first table used in this example is the BA-Client-History:</p>
        <sec id="sec-2-5-1">
          <title>The second table to be considered is the BA-Client-Table: Table 2: Fictive BA-Client</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-2-5-2">
          <title>The identification process goes as follows:</title>
          <p>1) In the first step the given relations between the IDs are used. Using the
BAClient-History, VSNRs 13111080S611 and 52111080S613 are allocated to
the same person via KNR 14 in BA-Client-History. KNR 12, 14 and 17 are
also assigned to that person because of having the same VSNR.
2) Taking into consideration the EGNR in the BA-Client-Table KNR 13 can be
related to KNR 12 via the identical EGNR 124. Therefore KNR 13 refers to
this person too.
3) Going one step further KNR 15 could also be related to this person because
of the identical VSNR (see BA-Client-History). At this point the second
identification step gets important. KNR 15 has a different sex, date of birth
and first name. When matching these four attributes no accordance can be
found. Therefore KNR 15 is identified as being a second person.
Considering the BA-Client-Table EGNR 125 is allocated to that second person.</p>
          <p>So in the end, linking the different related IDs would indicate one identical
person in all the given data, but matching the already mentioned four central
personal attributes result in an inconclusive match. Therefore we assume in this
case the related IDs would wrongly be linked. This results in the identification
of two separate persons. Person 1 has four different KNRs, two different
VSNRs and two EGNRs. Person 2 has one KNR, one VSNR and one EGNR.
This reduces the given five KNRs, two VSNRs and three EGNRs to two
comprehensively identified and checked person-IDs.</p>
          <p>4.2 Identifying and Handling Data Integration Inconsistencies
Now that we have an integrated and comprehensive person, the integration of
the data can begin. In this step of the data production process inconsistencies in
the data become visible. As mentioned above, there is nearly no cross-checking
of the data during the data registration process. So in the administrative process
only few of the registered information in the different IT-systems are validated
by comparing information between the different operational IT-systems. This
can lead to inconsistencies. For example one person can be registered as being
employed and unemployed at the same point of time, because these two status
information are raised by two different administrative institutions (pension
insurance and BA). But this also can happen in the BA data, when different
administrative processes and IT-systems are used. The following figure,
showing visualized spell data along the time axis from left to right, illustrates this
fact:
BeH: Time of employment | ASU: Time of job-search | LeH: Time of unemployment
benefit recipience | MTG: Time of participation in active labor market policy programs</p>
          <p>It can be seen that different data sources and states do have overlapping time
periods. On a first glance it is not clear which overlaps are plausible and which
are implausible. Under some premises overlapping times of employment and
job-search are allowed, but under other circumstances they are not. So legal
background knowledge is required to decide which overlapping spells should
be consolidated and which have to remain overlapping. A consolidation rule
would have to account for all possible (and impossible) overlapping times and
inconsistent states and information. A good example for those rules would be
the consolidation of employment times and times of unemployment benefit
recipience (SGB III). In general parallel times in this case are forbidden. But if
the employment does not exceed a certain amount of working hours per week,
parallel times of (small part time) employment and benefit recipience is
allowed. On the other hand full time employment parallel to benefit recipience is
not allowed under any circumstances. Here the exact knowledge of the legal
background is required to decide about the correct consolidation.3
3 It has to be noticed that such a combination of forbidden states might also be an indication
of benefit abuse. In any case, if data error or benefit abuse, only an exact knowledge of the
background information together with a sound analysis of the data itself allow an adequate
interpretation and consolidation of the data.</p>
          <p>All these sketched problems illustrate that a consolidation of data from two
different data sources perhaps might be possible, but developing consolidation
rules for more than two or three different data sources is very fast getting too
complex to do.</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-6">
        <title>4.3 Degree of Consolidation</title>
        <p>Beside the complexity of the necessary consolidation rules a second fact has to
be taken into account. Consolidating data always means overwriting and
therefore destruction of information. This means that there are two diverging
strategies concerning the consolidation of inconsistent data: Little consolidation
versus much consolidation. The strategies have direct implications for the
research that can be conducted with generated data base:
1) Little consolidation, coming with a smaller loss of information but many
inconsistencies, generates more individual research options and more
expenses for data preparation for the researcher. Following from this is in a
broader variety of research results, but also perhaps disparate and
incomparable findings.
2) Much consolidation overwrites information and this information is lost for
the researcher. A stronger consolidation results in structured data, thereby
also structuring the research options and minimizing the expenses for the
researcher. An error in the consolidation rules inevitably leads to
misinterpretations of the data, therefore possibly producing false research results.</p>
        <p>One more problem in integrated administrative data will be presented here.
This problem is directly related to the result of a strong consolidation strategy.
Much consolidation leads to overwritten information. But in administrative
data a seemingly similar attribute can have more than one process dependent
meaning resulting in different ranges of values. Training is good example for
this problem. Information about the level of training can be found in diverse
data sources. But the exact meaning of the attribute “training” changes for each
data source because it is directly related to the appropriate administrative
process. In case of employment data the information in that attribute are related to
employment, therefore more oriented on the level of education of the person. In
the case of job-seeking data the seemingly same attribute has a different range
of values and these values are skill-level oriented. That is the case because the
administrative purpose is job-search where the skill-level is the important
information. In such cases often it is impossible to correctly transcode the
different information, so the process related information has to be kept in the data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-7">
        <title>4.4 Handling Long Time-Series</title>
        <p>The fourth subject to be discussed here is the time dimension of the data. As
mentioned in chapter 2 the available time series of employment and benefit
recipient data starts in 1975. This means legal configurations could have
changed and in fact did change over the last 30 years, as well as the
administrative practices, the IT-systems, etc. Even formerly forbidden states in the data
today could be allowed or vice versa.</p>
        <p>Such long time series in process generated data provide special challenges.
The mentioned changes in the legislation, changes in the administrative
processes and practices and changes in the operational IT-systems all result in
breaches in the time series of the historical data. Moreover the classification of
occupation and economic sector, the range of values in attributes and the
regional information can and will change over time. Another big challenge poses
the old documentation, that is rudimental at best. Getting background
information regarding IT-systems or administrative practices from documentation from
the 1970s or the 1980s is nearly impossible. The experts from that times are
retired and therefore the knowledge is inaccessible.</p>
        <p>So, concerning historical data, there is no golden or general rule for
handling the data.</p>
        <p>In the case of changes in legislation or changes in the IT-systems the
smoothing of the breaches depends on the dimension of the change. A breach
in the time series is inevitable if an exact mapping of information from the
older data structure to the newer one is impossible. This is due to the fact that
without an exact mapping the transformation of older information into the
newer data structure would mean a massive and back dated overwriting of
information. It also would mean to inscribe data from the newer situation into a
different historical situation. Therefore the changes in the data only can be
documented if an exact mapping is not possible. This leaves the researcher free
to decide how he interprets and deals with the breaches.</p>
        <p>The same fact holds true for changing ranges of values in attributes. A good
example for that is the classification of economic sectors. This classification
changed three times in the last fifteen years. In two cases an exact one to one
mapping of old classification to new classification was not possible. In the last
change in about 30% of the old classifications the mapping to the new
classifications is inconclusive. This implies that there is no possibility to consolidate
the data. The solution here can only be describing and documenting the
changes. A researcher using the data can choose himself how to deal with this
breach in the time series of the data.</p>
        <p>Another strategy is used when regional information have to be integrated,
consolidated and updated. Regional information in many cases can be mapped
to the newest status. This is possible because for any case of change in the
dimension of the municipalities, there exists an exact mapping of old regional
information to new regional information. An example for this would be the
reformation of the size of districts in eastern Germany in the mid-1990s or in
Saxony in 2008. In each case it is clear which part of district went to which
new district or which districts were merged. This administrative information is
available and hence can be used to consolidate the regional information when
producing the integrated IAB data base.</p>
        <p>Summing up the remarks concerning historical data, it can be said that in
general a smoothing of the breaches in the long time series in the data is not
possible. Therefore the main focus lies on the exact documentation of known
facts and eventually of background knowledge.</p>
      </sec>

    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>To sum up the general guidelines, applicable for data errors stemming from
the data registration process as well as problems in time-series, the following
facts are consolidated:
- only valid values of an attribute are used
- only valid dates are used (e.g. start date &lt; end date)
- filters and default values in the operational IT-systems are documented as
far as they are known
- some central personal attributes like sex and date of birth are consolidated
on the basis of the identification of a comprehensive person
- background knowledge and important legal or procedural knowledge is
documented</p>
      <p>This brings us to the answer of the general methodological questions asked
in the introduction. There is no golden rule how to deal with inconsistencies in
the data, because each problem solving strategy has specific implications and
consequences. And these are general ones. An adequate answer to the question
of data integration und consolidation can only be an individual one and
depends on the specific project. But the consequences of each strategy always
have to be kept in mind.</p>
      <p>Our philosophy emphasizes weaker consolidation rules favoring
documentation instead of hard data consolidation. This leaves more degrees of freedom to
the researcher, enabling him to make the necessary decisions in data cleansing
by himself and fitting to his priorities. The IAB research data base therefore is
backed up by detailed and extensive documentation – a documentation that is
essential to know when working with this research data base. And this strategy
is applicable for other research data too.</p>
      <p>The IAB data integration and consolidation processes result in standardized
research data products, covering the complete targeted group with nearly no
item- or unit-nonresponse, gaps in retrospection, selective retention or recall
errors. On the other hand the data quality especially of data from the 1970s or
1980s is hard to grasp and, being administrative data, the data lack information
on household, attitudes, preferences, etc.</p>
      <p>The philosophy of data preparation in this data implies that only in clearly
defined cases consolidation is done. The emphasis lies on documentation of the
facts and background information. Therefore a good knowledge of the data
generation process, its problems and framework is required and essential for
using the full potential of the data.</p>
