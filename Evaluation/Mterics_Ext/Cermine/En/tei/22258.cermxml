        <p>▪ This article explores the paradox of women's academic employment in Turkey. There is a low rate of female labour market participation in the formal sector, yet a higher proportion of women professors than in any of the 25 European Union countries. We use a range of data to set the Turkish labour market and its higher education sector in comparative European perspective, then present findings from two qualitative studies of Turkish professors, concluding that ideological state support rather than legal frameworks of equal opportunities laid the foundations for women's hierarchical achievements in Turkey. However, the explanation is multilayered and lies in the cumulative and interrelated effect of state policy, institutional transparency, increased labour demand, the home-work interface, and the agency of the professors themselves.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>At the end of 2004, the EU agreed to open accession talks which could
lead to Turkey’s membership of the Union. Its candidacy, if successful,
would realize the key national project of modernization and
westernization, which has been central to Turkey’s dominant state ideology. Turkey
is often excluded from comparative studies of European employment, yet
there are good reasons to include it.</p>
      <p>
        There are important paradoxes in employment relations in Turkey:
women have one of the lowest rates of employment participation in
Europe, yet some benefit from limited vertical segregation which would
be envied by their European sisters. In particular, women achieve more
hierarchically in the professions and academia than their contemporaries
in western Europe and elsewhere

      <p>Across the industrialized world, feminist, human rights and civil</p>
      <p>European Journal of Industrial Relations 11(2)
liberties movements have achieved legal solutions for the elimination
of discrimination against women. In practice, the impact of
antidiscriminatory legislation is often limited to widening women’s access to
employment, but has had less success in challenging vertical segregation.
In Turkey, by contrast, anti-discrimination legislation is less advanced,
but vertical segregation is lower. We examine this paradox by comparing
patterns of women’s activity rates in Europe with those of Turkey; then
focus specifically on academic employment. To understand what these
macro and meso data mean at the level of the actor (that is, the lived
experience of professorial employment), we use qualitative studies of
professors in Turkish universities.</p>
      <p>To situate Turkey in its international context, we use Turkish data from
the Directorate General of Women’s Status and Problems in Ankara and
EU data from Eurostat and from Women in Science. To gain insight into
the policies and regulations on Turkish academic employment in general
and conditions of advancement to full professorial posts in particular,
documentary data were obtained from YÖK (the governing body of the
Turkish higher education sector) and the State Institute of Statistics.
Lastly, we undertook two qualitative studies, involving 57
semistructured interviews of Turkish full professors (30 men and 27 women).
The research was limited to ‘full’ professors, defined as academic workers
holding professorial chairs at universities subject to YÖK’s progression
criteria. They were drawn from six universities in Istanbul and five in
Ankara, since professors in these cities face fewer structural constraints
associated with their geographical career mobility.</p>
      <p>The interview schedule consisted of 32 questions exploring the
socioeconomic and institutional profiles of the respondents and allowing them
a degree of freedom to determine the issues that they wished to discuss
within a broad framework of sex equality, career development, and higher
education in Turkey. Interviews were undertaken in Turkish and the
transcripts translated into English.</p>

      <title>Perspective</title>
      <p>Turkey has one of the lowest female economic participation rates in
Europe — one which actually decreased from 34 percent in 1990 to 23
percent in 1995. The vast majority work in the agricultural sector as
unpaid family workers, while employment in the non-agricultural and
non-rural sectors is highly marginal not only quantitatively, but also in
terms of concentration in traditional female sectors such as textiles and
the food industry. Urban unemployment rates for women are more than
double those of men; the informal sector provides the greatest work</p>
      <p>Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Gender
opportunity for urban women from low-income households, which
means that they are typically excluded from the legal and social
protection and benefits available in the formal sector.</p>
      <p>
        Figure 1 ranks female economic activity rates as a proportion of
men’s among European countries, showing that Turkey ranks 23rd,
above only Cyprus, Italy, Greece, Spain and Malta. The Turkish
experience of liberalization has not increased women’s participation in the
labour market; rather, its unplanned nature, coupled with high levels of
internal migration from rural to urban areas in the past decade, has led to

      </p>
      <p>
        Male workers in Turkey are over-represented in forms of employment
that require lower educational qualifications. Women’s relative
participation rates increase with their educational levels, and this is particularly
marked for those with tertiary-level education. Nevertheless,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">OECD
(2004)</xref>
        data indicate that women with tertiary education still have
comparatively low levels of activity: below all other European countries,
on a par with Japan, and above only Korea and Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is noteworthy that the 12 European countries with the highest
activity rates for women are the four Nordic countries and eight of the
central and eastern European (CEE) countries. The lowest activity rates
tend to be in southern Europe. The extent to which these figures are
directly comparable has been questioned by a number of commentators,
since different definitions of employment, unemployment, and inactivity
significantly affect the data. For example, the southern countries,
including Turkey, tend to have a high share of informal-sector work. Within the
Eurostat definitions of economic activity, the trend among women is
towards increasing employment rates and decreasing inactivity rates

      <p>
        Given the very low economic activity rates of Turkish women, and the
predominantly Muslim population, it may surprise many western
commentators that the proportion of women academics who achieve
professorial status is very high
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref27 ref41 ref6">(Özbilgin and Healy, 2004; Woodward

employment can provide comparative insights to relate to the findings
of other country-specific studies.1
      </p>
      <p>
        A prerequisite of women’s success in academia is their prior success in
tertiary education. In 2002, the average percentage of graduates who were
women was 55.9 percent in the EU-15 and 63.7 percent in the accession
countries. In science in general and in engineering and manufacturing,
there was a higher percentage of women graduates in the accession
countries (48 percent and 25.6 percent, respectively) than in the EU-15 (41
percent and 20.9 percent, respectively). Turkey stands out as having a
lower proportion of women graduates (42.9 percent) than any of the
EU25 or associated countries. However, the feminized subject bias is less
entrenched in Turkey, with women representing 44.4 percent of science
graduates and 34.8 percent of those in engineering and manufacturing
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Eurostat, 2004)</xref>
        . However,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Palaz (2000)</xref>
        argues that recent trends indicate
a shift towards a more western style of horizontal gender segregation,

      <p>Figure 2 shows the average percentage of women academics in the
EU-25 as 34.8 percent. There is, however, a wide range, from Latvia,
where women make up more than 50 percent of academics to Ireland
where they are only 24.6 percent. Of the 13 countries above the mean,
six (including the top four) are from the CEE, two (Spain and Portugal)
from southern Europe, and three from the Nordic countries, together
with the UK. Turkey is also just above the mean. There is no clear
pattern by groupings of countries; nor does the gendered distribution
of academic employment match national rankings of economic activity
rates.</p>

under-represented at professorial level, holding on average only 14
percent of such posts. Some 11 countries are above the mean: four from
the CEE (of which only Latvia and Bulgaria have a higher than average
proportion of women academics) and four from southern Europe, plus
Belgium and the UK. At 27 percent, Turkey has the highest proportion
of professors who are women in Europe, almost twice the mean.
Curiously, countries with a long history of egalitarian policies, such as
Norway and Denmark, are below the mean.</p>

        Data from the European Technology Assessment Network
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(ETAN,

        show that in many countries the percentage of female full professors
slowly increased in the 1990s. In Poland, for example, women were 9.4
percent of titular professors in 1977, 16.6 percent in 1988, 20 percent in
1990, and 21.9 percent in 1996. While these kinds of data are not generally
available, its report also provides the example of Germany, where year-on
year-increases are not evident. On average in the EU, percentages of
women professors seem to be increasing by 0.5–1.0 percent a year — at this
rate it would take a century to attain a gender balance

      </p>
      <p>
        There are many possible reasons for Turkish women’s academic
achievements, many rooted in specific historical, social, and economic contexts.
Before turning to these, we pursue a more generic explanation: women
succeed when men leave an occupation because the rewards are greater
elsewhere.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Reskin and Roos (1990)</xref>
        argue that men may vacate certain
sectors or occupations if terms and conditions of employment decline, and
that women can compensate for the resulting labour shortages. While this
argument may have some resonance in particular countries, our own
research suggests that it does not hold good if the gendered distribution of
professorial appointments is compared cross-nationally with academic pay
(adjusted for purchasing power)

      <title>Historical Forces and Women’s Achievements in Turkey</title>
      <p>
        The dominant state ideology in Turkey has historically been a major
factor in understanding vertical segregation, a factor shared with CEE
accession countries. The foundation of the new Turkish Republic in the
early 1920s led to a series of reforms aiming to nationalize and
secularize the higher education sector. The move from the earlier Seljuk and
Ottoman systems to the contemporary university system embodied a
shift in emphasis from Turkish-Islamic to westernized models, and from
a nationalized system to one which is governed by a neo-liberal
internationalist approach (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Güvenç, 1997</xref>
        ). These changes can be periodized
into three phases.
      </p>
      <p>The first phase, in the 1920s and 1930s, led to the entry of women
into academic employment through a set of principles (secularism,</p>
      <p>
        Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Gender
republicanism, populism, statism, reformism and nationalism)
introduced by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the modern Turkish
Republic. These principles were part of a modernization project later
synonymous with the concept of ‘Kemalism’. The principles were
consolidated in the second phase of transformation from the 1940s to
the 1980s, as the number of women academics graduall
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">y increased
(YÖK, 2004</xref>
        ). A relatively stable growth rate of the university sector
has been replaced since 1985 by a third phase of rapid expansion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first two phases underpinned an ideological sanctioning of
women’s careers in academia and the professions. The Kemalist principles
of republican secularism upheld the value of sex equality over and against
a strong tradition of sex segregation originating from the Ottoman times
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref21 ref30">(Öncü, 1981; Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000)</xref>
        . Legislation requiring sex
equality in employment was rudimentary
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(Özbilgin, 2002; Woodward
and Özbilgin, 1999)</xref>
        ,2 but of critical importance was that the dominant
ideologies of ‘modernization’ and ‘westernization’ gave priority to the
elimination of overtly discriminatory policies and practices from the
formal processes of public employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though the post-communist countries are also shaped by a state
ideology of sex equality, the ideological differences with Turkey are
profound.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">James (1996</xref>
        : 45, 59) asserts that under communist rule, women
were strongly encouraged to enter the labour force, but that the policies
were designed to foster equal numerical participation in the labour force,
not equal access to high-status jobs and wages. To facilitate numerical
participation, childcare and maternity leave were heavily subsidized by
the government (although this subsidy has been substantially reduced in
the market economy). This facilitated women’s relatively high economic
activity rate. Analogous ideological and practical supports also underlie
the high participation rates in the Nordic countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">Zeytino g˘lu (1999</xref>
        ) and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Kandiyoti (1997)</xref>
        noted that academic careers
were historically and socially constructed and sex-typed as ‘safe’ and
‘proper’ choices for graduate women in Turkey. Women were socially
encouraged to take up professional employment, as opposed to
entrepreneurial or commercial careers, since these were considered
harmonious with the potent image of ‘a respectful Turkish woman’. This ideology
was effective in demarcating women’s careers in ‘safe’, ‘secure’, and
‘esteemed’ forms of professional employment.

      <p>The transformation of the political and social landscape in Turkey

      <p>
        European Journal of Industrial Relations 11(2)
‘state feminism’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">(White, 2003)</xref>
        . First, since the 1980s Turkey has pursued
a neo-liberal economic programme, weakening government labour
market regulation. This has diluted the traditional sex equality discourse
of the republican ideology pursued by the state in all sectors, including
higher education. Second, there have emerged political parties and
economic institutions that advocate sex segregation, in clear opposition
to the principles of secularism. Nevertheless, the current leading party,
the AKP, despite its Islamic agenda, has adopted a liberal approach and
discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
        These two changes have led to a shift in social attitudes. The image of
republican Turkish women, expected to ‘self-sacrifice’ and ‘pioneer’ for
the advancement of the nation, has lost its influence on a new generation
of young women graduates
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Özbilgin and Woodward, 2003)</xref>
        . It could be
argued that, like their counterparts in other European countries, many
women in modern Turkey perceive their careers with individualized
aspirations rather than a collectivist sense of fulfilling a national duty.
Thus, as the nationalistic and republican significance of women’s
employment in non-traditional disciplines is declining in Turkey, traditional
methods of eliminating sex-typing and segregation of academic careers
are following suit in higher education.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside the fragmentation of state ideology, there have been
significant sectoral changes in the past two decades. The expansion of the
university sector since the early 1990s has created greater opportunities
for career mobility for both female and male academics. Between 1990
and 2004, the number of universities increased from 29 to 76; the number
of state universities almost doubled and there was also an emergence of
private universities. The number of academic staff increased from 28,114
in 1989 to 60,129 in 1999, and professorial posts from 2772 to 8804 in the
same period, increasing to 10,080 in 2003 (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">YÖK, 2004</xref>
        ). Between 1990
and 2000 the number of full professors increased by 75 percent
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Aytaç
and Aytaç, 2001: 17)</xref>
        . The skills shortages which resulted from this
expansion enabled increased access for women and were also largely
responsible for mobilizing the upward progression of the otherwise relatively
static careers of many academic staff in this sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        While student participation has increased in Europe, this increase has
not necessarily led to comparable career opportunities, given the shift
from ‘elite’ to ‘mass’ in higher education delivery. Nevertheless,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Enders
(2002)</xref>
        argues that academic staff in Portugal and Spain benefited from
expansion; and as noted above, these are the two southern European
countries with rankings for women’s academic employment above the
European average.
      </p>
      <p>Expansion of the sector in Turkey occurred alongside a deterioration
of pay and conditions in the ‘old’ universities in the state sector, as
compared to the ‘new’ private universities. It is unclear how the growth</p>
      <p>
        Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Gender
of private universities will affect the gender order, given their relatively
small share (only 3 percent) in the sector
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Aytaç and Aytaç, 2001: 20)</xref>
        .
Özgüç (1998) suggested that male graduates traditionally pursued careers
which offered the best financial prospects and had limited and declining
interest in academic careers because salaries were lower than in the private
sector. This has resonance with the gender queues argument of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Reskin and
Roos (1990)</xref>
        , which suggests that changing market conditions may lead to
the feminizing of previously contested jobs. In the case of Turkey, as in
Spain and Portugal, it is new jobs that are offering women opportunities.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>Centralization of Rule Making: YÖK</title>
      <p>
        One of the influences on women’s academic development involves the
institutional level. The governance of the university sector has been
transformed from a decentralized system in the 1970s to one of centralization,
embodied by YÖK, in the 1980s and the 1990s. YÖK and its various
policies, which were often considered gender neutral, had a significant
gendered impact on the careers of female professors. Particular changes
in YÖK legislation, with a direct impact on the career development of
academic staff, defined the performance criteria and mobility
requirements that regulated professorial promotions. YÖK has been criticized
by many universities, academic staff, and their unions and associations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">(TUSIAD, 2000: 113)</xref>
        , and challenges to its status have resulted in some
30 revisions to its constitution since its establishment in 1981.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, the promotion system in the Turkish higher education
sector has a high degree of transparency compared to European
countries. YÖK regulations require professorial vacancies to be advertised in
one of the five highest circulation daily newspapers in Turkey
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref27">(Özbilgin
and Healy, 2004: 7)</xref>
        . Candidates have to provide a portfolio including
their CVs, details of their scientific publications, educational and training
activities, supervision of research degrees, and overall contribution to
their current institution. Three conditions are specified for promotion to
full professorship: first, applicants should have served at least five years
at associate professor grade in a discipline closely associated with the
professorial post sought; second, they should have a portfolio of original
research publications produced at an international level; and, third, they
should be selected for a professorial post
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(TUBA, 2004; YÖK, 1998)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>These regulations make no implicit or explicit reference to sex equality
issues, such as direct or indirect discrimination in promotion or selection
processes. Once candidates qualify through YÖK for a professorial chair,
they must also be appointed to a chair by their local university in order
for their title to be recognized. Each Turkish university, both state and
private, has its own promotion system; some are reportedly tougher than</p>
      <p>
        European Journal of Industrial Relations 11(2)
the YÖK procedure, placing heavier emphasis on research output in the
form of international publications
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref21 ref30">(Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000: 85)</xref>
        .
This creates a two-track employment system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, Özbilgin and Heal
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">y (2004</xref>
        : 8) argue that this
standardized system of recruitment is more open and, in principle, provides
greater equality of access to full professorial posts than in many other
countries, where such standardization is rare. The appointment of
professors in Europe and the US often involves multiple systems; many of
these are obscure, allow variable criteria for appointment, and often rely
on internal labour markets. The most open systems rely on the
requirement for similar attributes to those under the YÖK system. While many
western academics assume that their professorial appointment systems
are of an equal or superior academic level to those of other, particularly
less developed, countries, such assumptions should be questioned
particularly in debates on gender equity. The ETAN (2000: viii) report
on mainstreaming gender equality in Europe stated that old-fashioned
practices permeate employment and promotion procedures in many
academic institutions: patronage, ‘old boys’ networks’, and personal
invitations to fill posts cut across ‘fair and effective employment procedures’.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the greater transparency in the Turkish system, it is important
to recognize that competition for posts in particular universities and
organizational politics militate against universally equitable outcomes
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref27">(Özbilgin and Healy, 2004: 8)</xref>
        . In this, Turkey shares a common
experience with western European and North American university systems.

      <title>The Lived Experiences of Turkish Professors</title>
      <p>We now turn to qualitative evidence at the microlevel. While we
acknowledge women’s achievement in academic work in Turkey, it is important
to remember that those who achieve hierarchical success are still
relatively rare. To explore the perceptions of men and women professors, we
focus on two key interrelated elements of their employment
relationships: the home–work interface and structures of discrimination.</p>
      <sec id="sec-9-1">
        <title>Home–Work Interface</title>
        <p>
          There are both universal and nationally specific dimensions to our
findings. Though Turkish women have attained professional careers for
some eight decades, the traditional family ideology and gender division
of labour, which assigned carer and domestic roles to women and
breadwinner roles to men, remains the main social frame of reference
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Peker,
1996)</xref>
          . Our study of senior academics reveals a near universal picture of
gendered domestic roles and responsibilities. Women are responsible for
        </p>
        <p>Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Gender
managing the household; men ‘help’ rather than sharing domestic tasks.
The ‘normality’ of this was indicated by an apparent lack of association
between domestic responsibilities and career development. None of our
male respondents mentioned family affairs as hindering their promotion
(one stated that ‘I’m involved in my own academic tasks usually,
sometimes I help her with the housework’), but nor did female professors
recognize structural barriers. They reported that they were largely
content with (or perhaps resigned to) their dual roles, and often
normalized the burden caused by domestic work by failing to question the role
distribution.</p>
        <p>The following statement by a female professor is typical: ‘Actually
family did not hinder me but when my children were younger I had
difficulties in doing research, teaching, working and also taking care of the
house’. Another explained this paradoxical situation:</p>
        <p>I believe that there is equality between the sexes. However, once you
enter the academic profession, the difficulties they [women and men] face
are different. However much men help, responsibilities of caring for the
family and children are expected of women . . . It is very positive for a
woman to have an academic career. It has high social status. It is not
important if she earns less. However, if men earn less, they are victimized.</p>
        <p>
          The paradox is complicated by the expectation that women will marry
upward socially, and those who are highly qualified thus find a reduced
pool of potential partners. Accordingly, some 41 percent of women
academics are married to other academics
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref21 ref30">(Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000:
30)</xref>
          . The established gender order in the home constrains such women’s
employment ‘choices’
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Healy, 1999)</xref>
          . Dual-career families in the study,
and other female academics, often employed domestic help to redress the
imbalance in the share of domestic work. A male professor explained that
‘having assistance reduces my wife’s domestic responsibilities. We have a
commercial cleaning service. My wife is responsible for cooking’.
        </p>
        <p>Female respondents recognized gendered structural constraints for
men and suggested that ‘financial responsibilities of being a man’ and
‘compulsory military service’ are the main hindrances for men’s career
advancement in the sector. One male professor stated that barriers to
career development exist only for men for these reasons, while other men
saw marriage and childcare as important barriers to women’s career
development. Neither marriage nor childcare appeared to constitute a
problem for male respondents.</p>
        <p>Women respondents appreciated men’s help and contribution to their
career. ‘My mother and father supported me both in material and spiritual
ways until I lost them,’ said one. ‘Since I got married, my husband has
been supporting me by being understanding about my work and
exchanging ideas with me’. Only five of the 30 male professors</p>
        <p>European Journal of Industrial Relations 11(2)
acknowledged the support of their immediate families; another five cited
support received from their colleagues.3 As well as the support of their
immediate families, female professors mentioned friends and colleagues.
PhD supervisors were highlighted as important sources of support at
both the academic and emotional level.</p>
        <p>
          The role of significant others, particularly partners, is a recurring
theme in the literature on women’s achievement
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref22">(Healy and Kraithman,
1996; Ledwith et al., 1991)</xref>
          .
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Deem (2003)</xref>
          , in her study of women
academics in the UK, found that most women raised gender issues
ranging from inequitable household and motherhood responsibilities to
sexist behaviour by some male colleagues and discrimination in
promotion. The link with the male domestic contribution is important in
moving to gender equality. As Esping-Andersen (2002: 124) argues,
neither social nor labour market policies alone will produce such
equality; he identifies the ‘admittedly weak feminization of the male life
cycle’ as a barrier to equal career opportunities in the Nordic countries.

      <sec id="sec-9-2">
        <title>Structures of Gendered Discrimination</title>
        <p>Women in Turkey face further structures of gendered discrimination, yet
the perception of gendered disadvantage was not high among our
respondents. When asked about barriers that they faced as academic workers,
there was, however, a gendered variation. Many male professors claimed
to have faced no disadvantages or barriers, but a few identified
institutional constraints in the promotion procedures. While many female
professors argued that they had not experienced personal barriers to their
career development, some did identify barriers to their career
advancement, such as lack of support from family and friends, undergoing a
divorce, having a child with a disability, and administrative obstructions.
In general, while men tended to perceive institutional constraints, women
were more likely to perceive familial constraints. One female professor
suggested that men have inherited advantages in social life which spill
over into academic life: ‘I think that women’s success is not easily
accepted by women and men . . . Men are performing their professional
duties more independently compared to women. They are already
conditioned to be successful in academic and social life’.</p>
        <p>Some male professors accepted that there is gender discrimination in
working life, but not in academic life. The belief in the high prestige and
reputation of the profession conceals some inequalities, implying a
perceived superiority and lack of discrimination in the academic
profession. As one commented, ‘gender discrimination is not a significant
issue here [in the university] and being men or women is beyond question
in an academic institution’. The underpinning assumption is that the
socially privileged position of academic workers in Turkey, particularly</p>
        <p>Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Gender
full professors, must give them some degree of immunity from
discrimination: ‘I do not believe in discrimination in this profession. Women face
discrimination in lots of other sectors but not in the university system’.
The issue of gender discrimination is almost invisible to male professors,
who are mostly very certain that there is no sex discrimination in
university or academic life. ‘There are no barriers to women in Turkey in
this area. I’ve never encountered it even in the most conservative places.
Male colleagues also do support them [women]’.</p>
        <p>
          The belief in the equitable ideal of employment recurs in other Turkish
studies, for example of universities
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref21 ref30">(Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000: 65)</xref>
          and
banking
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Özbilgin and Woodward, 2003)</xref>
          . This belief is, nevertheless,
often accompanied by the view that women academics should work more
than men in order to achieve career success. However, this view was not
universally shared by women: as one respondent insisted, ‘all the
discriminatory factors that exist in social life prevail in academic life as well’.

      <title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Mischau (2001</xref>
        : 25) has remarked that ‘there is no university where the
percentage of female professors corresponds with the percentage of
female academic staff or students’. While Turkish women’s progress in
academia seems greater than their European counterparts, this success is
not underpinned by a critical mass of women academics nor by
widespread labour market activity by women. It is evident that strong
historical and national forces have been the main incentive for educated
women to contribute to the modernization of Turkey; whereas in
Europe, the major impetus has come from legislation designed to combat
the negative effects of discrimination.
      </p>
      <p>We have concentrated on Turkey, but we recognize that some of the
characteristics identified for Turkey may be shared with other European
countries, notable those in the CEE. What distinguishes Turkey is the
contradiction between women’s low labour market participation and
their success in the professions, which seems counter-intuitive to the
western eye. Most western commentators seek remedial measures for
gendered discrimination in the strengthening of legislation. For Turkey,
this class of women benefited not from legislation, but from a strong state
ideology of equality. This ‘state feminism’ resulted from the rupture with
the Ottoman Empire in 1923. Thus revolutionary change transformed the
lives of middle-class women.</p>
      <p>Academic women felt the impact of this transformation. At the
institutional level, it was underpinned with the introduction of YÖK: the
transparency of its employment policies has facilitated women’s progress.
This transparency is continually sought by feminists in universities in</p>
      <p>
        European Journal of Industrial Relations 11(2)
Europe and North America, but often with at best partial success.
Nevertheless, to make an obvious point, for women to achieve hierarchical
success in an occupation, they must take jobs from men or must benefit
disproportionately from an increase in employment opportunities for
both. Part of the cumulative explanation of women’s success in Turkish
academia could be the exodus of men from the profession, consistent
with the interpretation by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Reskin and Roos (1990)</xref>
        of the feminization of
some North American occupations. Given Turkey’s comparatively low
level of academic pay and the associated view that academic work is no
longer attractive for men, this argument might seem persuasive. However,
Eurostat data do not support this interpretation: academic salaries in
Turkey, in terms of purchasing power, are not lower than those in
countries with a far lower proportion of women academics. It is the
expansion of the university sector that has provided new opportunities for both
women and men.
      </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Turkish women face severe career constraints. A strong
family ideology continues to result in the underemployment of women
with tertiary education. At the same time, the family can have
contradictory functions: our study demonstrates its importance in enabling and
facilitating women to develop their academic careers. The women
professors also demonstrated that they used the degrees of freedom available
to develop their careers and allow their ‘choices’ to become a reality.
Their constrained agency was accepted within the societal context, and it
appeared that the support they received was conditional on respecting the
bounds of the family ideology.</p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Esping-Andersen (2002)</xref>
        argues that there exists a broad consensus on
what constitutes women-friendly policy. It includes affordable day care,
paid maternity and parental leave, a right to leave when children are ill,
and the ability to match work with school hours. But he adds that this is
not sufficient: there is a need to change both gendered choices and
societal constraints, including an inducement to men to embrace a more
‘feminine’ life cycle. Unlike Turkey (and also many CEE countries),
Denmark has some of the best ‘packages’ of equality benefits, and its
female employment rate nearly matches that of men’s; yet women’s share
of academic employment, in particular at professorial level, is well below
the European average.
      </p>
      <p>The continued hierarchical achievement of women in Turkish academia
is under threat at different levels. There is a weakening of the dominant
state ideology; greater liberalization in higher education may lead to more
‘flexibility’ and less transparency. Our study indicates the importance of
family; however, balancing work and family roles is also contingent on
financial resources to support help with household and childcare tasks.
Family is both a constraint and an enabler; in this there are both
commonalities as well as national particularities across Europe.</p>
      <p>Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Gender</p>
      <p>Our study of Turkey is important in the context of the ‘New Europe’,
since it demonstrates the importance of state ideology in promoting
gender equality. The explanation of Turkish women’s academic success is
multilayered and lies in the cumulative and interrelated effect of state
policy, institutional transparency, increased labour demand, the
home–work interface, and the agency of the professors themselves. This
example is, nevertheless, not typical of Turkish women’s labour market
experience, and it should be emphasized that this article draws on the
experience of a highly educated and privileged elite. This does not negate
the importance of their experience; after all, it is such women who are at
the centre of debates on vertical segregation in the countries of Europe.
The Turkish example suggests that the legislatively focused European
approach to equality, which Turkey is now adopting as part of its
candidacy for EU membership, is necessary, but not sufficient to achieve
gender equality.</p>
