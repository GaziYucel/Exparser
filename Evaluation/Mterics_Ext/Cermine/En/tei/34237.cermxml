        <p>The last decades have seen a deepening of paradiplomacy which is an especially important phenomenon for the federal states. This development became a source of change in the constitutions of federal states in order to trace prospects and limits for such process. Brazil is part of the group of states where non-central governments reaching beyond the national borders have occurred without a legal framework specific to the issue. In a federal state known for its centralization like Brazil such discussion can be harsh but its relevance to local and regional development and to the balance of the federative pact turns is necessary.</p>

          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>
            Recent years have seen a deepening of studies on the international action of the
socalled sub-national1 governments. It is an especially important phenomenon for federal
states, since existing democratic regimes and federalism as a form of the state are
considered relevant internal factors for the development of international relations of
subnational governments
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Vigevani 2006)</xref>
            . Therefore, although it is not a phenomenon
unique to federal states, the international insertion of non-central government has
developed with some frequency and success in this form of state which makes this a
relevant theme for the understanding of the contemporary contours of federalism.
          </p>
          <p>This development has meant that some federations have adapted their legislation
to draw up the perspectives and limits of the international action of sub-national
governments. Brazil is part of a group of states where non-central governments,
reaching beyond the national borders, have formed without a legal framework dictating
the process. This article seeks to understand how Brazilian national legal regulations
have dealt with this phenomenon and how the process of legal framing of
paradiplomacy is developing to meet the challenges this trend engenders.</p>
          <p>Initially, I analyze the actions of sub-national governments in international
development, concentrating specifically on the causes themselves and their growth.
Then the tendencies of the constitutionalization of the international relations
undertaken by sub-national governments will be examined, before moving on to review
the efforts to make it part of the law system in Brazil. Finally, I review the
consequences of un-constitutionalized paradiplomacy.</p>
          <p>
            1. The Development of Paradiplomacy
Paradiplomacy refers to international action by non-central governments2
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Soldatos
1990)</xref>
            .3 Widespread international action of federal entities began before the 1970s and
1980s. Explanations for this development range from factors internal to federations
through to aspects acquired by the international system in recent decades
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Keating
1999, Romero 2004)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>Within federal states the drivers of paradiplomacy often include the division of
competencies and autonomy given to sub-units through federative pacts. The need for
members of the federation to fulfill competencies laid out by Constitutional charters

          <p>Academically, it would be correct to use the term “sub-state governments”, given the
distinction between State and Nation. However, due to the fact that it is generally accepted in
literature, the expression “sub-national governments” will be used in this paper. In the same
way, the term “non-central governments” will be used to refer to these entities, in contrast to
“central governments”.</p>
          <p>The term “non-central government” should be understood in a broad way, meaning a
constituent unit of a federal country or an administrative division of a unitary state.</p>
          <p>On possible discussions about the nomenclature, see: Zabala 2000; Romero 2004.
requires that members seek ways of meeting local and regional demands not fully met
by the central government. Furthermore states’ reduced participation in their national
economies in the 1980s and 1990s with the spread of neo-liberal economic policy
began to be seen as an important instrument for the improvement of sub-national
public policies. This movement is facilitated, in the case of federations, because of
greater autonomy granted by central governments; unlike what has been seen to occur
in unitary states.</p>
          <p>
            Also the evolution of the international system in recent decades has driven
paradiplomacy. The beginning of international action by non-central governments took
place in the larger context of the democratization of the international system; a process
that began after the Second World War
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Sassen 2001.)</xref>
            Therefore an important change
occurred in the once exclusively inter-state system which had dominated the
international arena since the 17th century. Although states remain the primary actors in
this scenario, the acceleration of international flows – or globalization – and the
development of regional integration processes have facilitated the emergence of
important new players to a once foreign sphere.
          </p>
          <p>The processes of globalization and regional integration create favorable conditions
for the increased action of sub-national governments in the foreign sphere. Waves of
migration for example, bring about the need for non-central governments to deal with
cultural and linguistic diversity that increase the probability of closer bonds with foreign
institutions and governments. Furthermore, the expansion of multinational corporations
has meant that sub-national governments need to develop policies focused on
economic internationalization, preparing their population and territory for the arrival of
foreign investments.</p>
          <p>The changes accompany a corresponding change in the approach of international
problem solving; moving from a state-centric approach to one welcoming input from
constituent units. The perception that regional and local level governments must be
included in problem-solving efforts related to these issues led to a greater
consideration of these spheres in efforts of international agencies and organizations.4</p>
          <p>There is a tendency for paradiplomacy to supplement the activities of non-central
governments in their sphere of competence with the unique aspect that they go beyond
national frontiers. In extremely rare cases, the international relations of sub-national
governments go against the foreign policy of the federal government or encroach into
jurisdictions outside of a given non-central government. 5

          <p>
            Therefore, during the 1990s, the United Nations held large conferences which were drivers
for sub-national governments, and, above all, the local powers were able to establish
themselves on the international scene
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Rodrigues 2004, p. 441)</xref>
            . Along the same line, in
2000, the United Nations launched the Goals of the Millenium, considered one of the most
important programs currently run by the institution. Through this, the UN has sought to
involve regional and local governments, understanding that the solution for the big problems
affecting states today need to be dealt with at the sub-national level.
          </p>
          <p>This kind of foreign relations by sub-national governments is called protodiplomacy and has
been more widely studied in the autonomous regions of Spain (Segura 2004).</p>
          <p>In Brazil paradiplomacy started to move forward more firmly in the 1980s, with the
redemocratization of the country after years of military dictatorship.6 A symbol of the
new democratic phase, the federal constitution of 1988 formally entrenched the right of
common citizens to participate in the democratic process. The constitution incorporated
both the relevance of consensus and the need for the participation of minorities.
However the constitution also brought considerable administrative and political
decentralization through greater tax distribution and an extension of the sharing of
competences between federal entities. There is a greater autonomy of member states
and,7 since they gained greater autonomy over the budgets, a larger number of
competing competences.8</p>
          <p>During the 1980s, following the paths of the world economy and the crisis of the
development-state based ideology of the 1970s; the Brazilian economy went through
an important period of adjustments. Brazil joined the new wave of economic liberalism
that affected most of the Western world. As part of the adaptation to this new context,
the federal government started an intensified process of economic deregulation, the
privatization of public corporations and opening to foreign capital. In practice, this
meant a reduction of the nation state in domestic affairs and a greater opening to the
international market.</p>
          <p>During the transition to economic liberalism, a reduction in the economic and
financial actions of the central government created a vacuum. This vacuum was then
filled by the sub-national entities and municipalities of Brazil. The seizing of
opportunities provided by foreign investment appeared as an appealing alternative to
other options that were advanced to deal with the issues which were arising (Barreto
2004). Brazilian sub-national governments have being specially active in seeking
international loans and attracting foreign investments by tax incentives for multinational
enterprises.</p>
          <p>There is some consensus in the literature about what promotes international
organizations to seek constituent level input in federations. Michael Keating was one of
the first scholars to define three general groups of such motivations that fit the Brazilian
situation, these causes are economic, political and cultural (Keating 2004). In the
economic sphere, it is sought after international funding, as well as foreign investments
and increased exports of locally produced goods. In the political sphere, agreements
6 It is true that some international actions of member states can be seen since the 1960s.</p>
          <p>There was the protest of the then Governor of the State of Rio Grande do Sul against the
federal government for not taking part in the negotiations for the creation of the Latin
American Free Trade Association and also the creation of the International Relations
Secretariat in the State of Minas Gerais. Although they were important initiatives bringing the
theme of internationalization to sub-national governments, they were isolated initiatives.
7 The 1988 federal constitution included the municipalities as members of the Brazilian
federation, inaugurating a three-way federal system.
8 This does not mean, however, that Brazil is a truly decentralized federation. With the
constitution of 1988 there was a move towards decentralization, when compared to previous
periods, but the country still has a strongly centralized structure.
are made to empower local public policies and disseminate best practices as well as
carry the needs of sub-national governments to the international system – through
networks of cities and bilateral agreements, for example. In the cultural sphere,
subnational governments seek agreements that deal with migratory flows and which allow
greater visibility to increase tourism.</p>
          <p>Therefore, it can be seen that the pragmatics of paradiplomacy in Brazil – as well
as in other countries where this phenomenon occurs – can involve a variety of
agreements from contracts to international agreements. There are different degrees of
commitment taken on by sub-national governments which raises questions about the
legal aspects of the phenomenon.</p>
          <p>
            2. Tendencies of Constitutionalization of Paradiplomacy in Federal States
International law only recognizes as unquestioned legal entities the states and
international organizations – as well as a few entities close to these two categories
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Shaw, 2003)</xref>
            . Therefore, from the traditional view of international relations, there is no
clear answer as to what the legal reach of sub-national governments is the international
system. To rectify this issue, governments should turn to national norms as guidelines
to define acceptable state action (Pellet 2002). This depends essentially on the degree
of decentralization of the federation: the higher decentralization is the greater the
probability of constitutional permission for paradiplomacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Brazilian federal constitution does not foresee international relationships
between sub-national governments, the federal district (Brasília, the federal capital)
and municipalities
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Rodrigues 2008, p. 1019)</xref>
            . In spite of this, the practice of foreign
interaction with states has become deeper and more widespread among the
subnational governments. The distance between practice and law in the sphere of
paradiplomacy has a reason. It is difficult to create an appropriate legal framework that
can deal with the complexity of the process, as well as its dynamics.
          </p>
          <p>However the constitutionalization of paradiplomacy may bring restrictions to the
international action of the sub-national entities. Therefore, in understanding the
obstacles of a possible constitutional reform, it is important to analyze the standards
adopted by federal states in adapting their legal frameworks with regard to (a) the kind
of norms utilized, and (b) the material competencies designated, as well as (c) the
limits established.</p>
          <p>
            a) Norms: By definition, the federal constitution is the basic document which deals
with the division of competencies between federated entities; therefore, it should be the
main instrument to define the possibility and the limits of paradiplomacy
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Rezek 2005.)</xref>
            With paradiplomacy foreseen in the constitution, it follows the principle of legality,
inherent to administrative law which means that all actions of the public administration
should be guided by law. The federal constitution should establish the areas where
involvement of the sub-national entities would be suitable and, therefore, underline the
centralization of power-- whether in the federation itself, or in the member states
(Moraes 1998, p. 28).
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, in most cases, the rules regulating international actions by members of
the federation have been done through constitutional amendments. That is what
happened in Belgium, with the constitutional reform of 1993, in Argentina in 1994 and,
in Austria in 2002. A different understanding of the issue occurred in the Mexican
federation, which chose to normatize paradiplomacy through an infra-constitutional law.
In spite of the outspoken disagreement of the local constitutionalists with regard to the
suitability of this decree
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Abraham 2007, p. 280)</xref>
            . Since 1992 Mexico has had the “Law
of Celebration of Treaties” which widens the possibility of international participation with
some autonomy by sub-national entities. Therefore, although the Mexican constitution
affirms the impossibility of international agreements by non-central governments, an
infra-constitutional norm admits this possibility.
          </p>
          <p>b) Material competences: With regard to the issues about which the federal
subunits may deal with in international agreements, it is usually established that they
may make agreements on any issue within their sphere of competence. The Swiss
constitution, for example, foresees the possibility of agreements between cantons and
foreign states, in which they must limit themselves to the competences of federated
entities. The German constitution is similar, indicating the possibility of member states
celebrating international agreements in the sphere of their attributions. The Austrian
Constitution, which indicates that the Länder may sign treaties with states of
neighboring Austria or with other states, as long as they are within the competences
attributed to them.</p>
          <p>To a lesser extent, there are cases in which federated entities only deal with
issues related to their exclusive competences. This occurs often in Belgium. Although
in theory the Belgian Constitution allows for the possibility of agreements by
communities and regions on issues within their competence, in practice, these
agreements mostly focus on issues of education and culture, which are exclusive
competences of sub-national governments. In practical terms, there is in the Belgian
case, a sharing of competences on treaties issues.</p>
          <p>The fact is that, without exception, legal provisions dealing with paradiplomacy
pigeon-hole state government into dealing with issues of low politics; like trade, culture
and those issues that are not directly related to sovereignty or national security. This
can be seen in the constitutional dynamics of the federated states, which attributes to
the central government the competence to deal with issues related to high politics.9
c) Limits: The constitutionalization of paradiplomacy does not occur without
precise limits. Besides the issue of delineating competences, there are also procedural
limits for sub-national governments to operate internationally. The most common
9</p>
          <p>There has been some discussion about the possibility of classifying issues as low politics
and high politics, since that, in an interdependent world, they tend to overlap with some
frequency, see Ripsman 2004.
constraint is of prior approval of the federal sphere. The agencies responsible for
approval vary. Some states grant the executive power; for example the ministry
responsible for foreign affairs has the authority to approve or not approve a negotiation
or agreement. In others, the Legislative branch has the power to approve these
agreements.</p>
          <p>This limit imposed by some constitutions – in fact most of them – has a negative
implication on the dynamics of paradiplomacy. The international actions of non-central
governments begin even before there is a constitutional reference about them – as in
the Brazilian case. Therefore, when the matter becomes constitutionalized and begins
to require that every agreement should be previously approved by a central
government agency, the celerity of the movement is lost. Some interesting solutions
have been found to counter-act this problem. In Austria, the federal government must
be informed by the governor of the Land before negotiations of an international
agreement are initiated and then it has eight weeks to issue a decision. If there is no
refusal during this period, it is tacitly understood that the request has been approved,
and the state government may start the negotiations.</p>
          <p>Another interesting case is that of the United States. The federal constitution says
that the federated subunits may have agreements abroad, with the stipulation that the
state has the approval of U.S. Congress for the agreement to take effect. The
interpretation of this condition was initially restrictive, in the understanding that
Congress should be consulted about any foreign actions by non-central governments.
The intensification of paradiplomacy increased the scope – which was possible mostly
due to the fact that the United States is governed by a common law system. With the
dramatic increase of the number of agreements signed by single states today, there is
not full compliance with the constitutional requirement of a consultation to the U.S.
Congress (Lessa 2002, p. 41.) Many of these agreements are carried out directly
between the parties to save time. U.S. Congress itself, understanding the risk of its
operations could be compromised due to the number of agreements to be approved,
has interpreted that only agreements which interfere with security and the guidelines of
national foreign policy should be examined (Branco 2006, p.71.)</p>
          <p>The policy of approval works both ways as there can also be issues of
compatibility with the foreign policy followed by central government. This fact is related
to the classical view that the nation state should be seen as a unit in the international
system. This would be mitigated by policies on paradiplomacy that did not follow the
guidelines dictated by central government. In the same way, internal governability
could be damaged if agreements of sub-national governments went against the
interests of the federal government. This issue arises in commitments taken on by the
federal state. The agreements should not fail to harmonize with previous obligations
assumed by central government whether in the national or international spheres.
3. In search of a legally ordained paradiplomacy in Brazil
In recent years, the discussion on the need to legally ordain paradiplomacy has led to
an attempt to constitutionalize the matter as well as some efforts at infra-constitutional
legal framing.</p>
          <p>In 2005 the constitutional amendment proposal no. 475 was sent to the Brazilian
congress. The amendment no. 475 regulated the action of member states, the federal
district and municipalities internationally. It did so through an addition to the
constitutional law that dealt with competences common to federated entities. If
approved, the constitution would state that these entities could bring about acts and
sign agreements or contracts with sub-national foreign governments, as long as the
constitutional competences for each entity were followed and the competences which
are exclusive to the union be avoided. The constitution, justice, and citizenship
committee of the national congress argued that the lack of explicit permission in the
constitution about international actions by federated members was not sufficient reason
to forbid it. The argument of the committee, although contrary to the majority view on
this issue, which states the need for the competences of federated entities to be stated
in the constitution, prevailed and the constitutional amendment proposal was rejected.</p>
          <p>This was followed by attempts of non-constitutional legal framing. There is a
proposal in senate today10 substituting white paper supplementary law no. 98 from
2006. This proposal rules on the possibility of member states, municipalities and
federal district to act in the foreign sphere through signing agreements, which should
be examined previously by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is difficult to imagine how
approval could be attained with efficiency for Brazilian municipalities, which today
number over 5,500.</p>
          <p>Besides the substitution proposal, there are two protocols in congress, signed by
the Brazilian federal government with the governments of France and Italy that seek to
provide a framework for paradiplomacy between the states in agreements. The
protocols indicate the importance of this movement and establish possible modalities of
the action of sub-national governments – in areas of their competence – as well as the
need for prior consent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the signing of agreements.</p>
          <p>4. Consequences of the lack of legal framing
The lack of legal framing of paradiplomacy has both positive and negative
consequences in the Brazilian case. There a legitimate concern by the sub-national
governments that, in inserting paradiplomacy in the legal framework, the limits are too
wide and the process becomes limited. These are almost inherent consequences to
phenomena that develop outside legal principles. To imagine that each negotiation or
agreement carried out today at the initiative of sub-national governments has then to
be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the national congress is very
10 As of the writing of this paper in July 2010.
disturbing for those who are already part of the process and this is not because of the
concern that the agreement might be refused. Paradiplomacy in Brazil, in spite of the
lack of an actual legal framework, does not tend to usurp competences of other
spheres or to act contrary to the foreign policy of the country. The greater concern is
the amount of red tape that will bind down a process that ought to be dynamic in order
to truly attain its objectives.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, a negative consequence of the lack of constitutionalization of
the phenomenon is the lack of guidance on the practice of sub-national international
relations. Also, an important concern is the possibility that state and municipal public
administration could have their actions questioned in court or in a court of auditors
because they are beyond their constitutional competences. So far this has not occurred
for the executive power11. However, it is necessary to observe that the forms of
interaction of non-central governments in the international system have become
sophisticated, which raises the possibility of some kind of inspection.</p>
          <p>Another important issue related to the lack of a legal framework is the
responsibility for international agreements that are not upheld. In the Brazilian case, it
is not clear who would be responsible for default on agreements made by sub-national
governments. With the possibility of new government cycles, this hypothesis is
especially serious because of the possible default on commitments assumed by
previous governments.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-3-2">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>As happened in other countries, Brazil faces a troublesome dichotomy on the
constitutionalization of paradiplomacy. There is no easy answer to the issue since the
contours of possible legislation on the theme can vary stalling the process. It is true
that the debates on the issue in Brazil are still at too early a stage to draw up an
adequate legal framing. Carrying out a constitutional reform that is coherent both with
the Brazilian legal system and the demands of the federal government and of the
subnational governments seems unlikely at this time. This does not, however, reduce the
importance of deepening the dialogue. On the contrary, it reaffirms the need.
11 There are two lawsuits by the Rio Grande do Sul Public Prosecutor’s Office in Novo
Hamburgo, questioning travel by town counselors accompanying the mayor on trips abroad.
One of them is against 24 counselors and ex-counselors for mismanagement of public
resources because of trips in 2004, 2005 and 2007. Besides those that benefited with their
expenses being paid, the Public Prosecutor’s Office also targets counselors who voted in the
plenary in favor of the trips to France, China and the Iberian Peninsula. According to the
counselors, the missions had the purpose of drawing together Brazilian and foreign
companies and getting to know the technology of the countries visited. Another lawsuit refers
to trips to India in 2008. The Public Prosecutor’s Office does not question the possibility of
municipal authorities defending local interests in the foreign sphere, but the need for
representatives from the Legislative to do so (Dutra 2008).</p>
          <p>Paradiplomacy is an important tool to reaffirm the idea of a national project that
seeks greater development and greater autonomy for its subunits. In this context, being
able to rely on institutional and legal frameworks that extend the chances of bringing
this into effect is a way of assisting in the balance of federative agreement.
