This paper addresses the question of what role morally oriented behavior plays in the
efficiency of market outcomes. This issue is as controversial in economics as it is in
sociology. To get a better understanding of the problems and opportunities involved
in morally oriented behavior in markets, I develop a typology that distinguishes four
different forms of morality-based behavior and try to understand what consequences
derive from these types of morally motivated action. The four forms I discuss I
call “cooperation,” “group solidarity,” “blocked exchange” and “altruism.” There is a
fifth – parasitic – type that I call “Trojan altruism.” I argue that the contested role of
morality is rooted in the profoundly ambivalent consequences that morality has on
market efficiency.</p>

      <p>In diesem Discussion Paper betrachte ich die Auswirkungen moralisch orientierten
Handelns auf die Effizienz von Märkten. Diese Frage ist sowohl unter Soziologen als
auch unter Ökonomen stark umstritten. Um zu einem besseren Verständnis der
Probleme und Chancen zu gelangen, die sich aus moralischen Handlungsorientierungen
für Marktbeziehungen ergeben, entwickele ich eine Typologie, mit der vier
verschiedene Formen moralgestützten Handelns unterschieden werden. Die vier Formen
nenne ich „Kooperation“, „Gruppensolidarität“, „blockierter Tausch“ und
„Altruismus“. Darüber hinaus besteht ein fünfter, parasitärer Typus, den ich als
„Trojanischen Altruismus“ bezeichne. Ich zeige, dass die umstrittene Rolle von Moralität für
Märkte ihren Hintergrund in den tatsächlich zutiefst ambivalenten Folgen von
Moralität für die Effizienz von Märkten hat.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        What role does morality play for market outcomes? For most sociologists the
functioning of markets is closely connected to the moral conduct of economic actors. This
position is expressed, for instance, by the French sociologist Émile
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Durkheim (1984)</xref>
        who argued that purely self-interested behavior cannot produce stable exchange
relations. Only through the “non contractual conditions of contract” do actors feel
effectively bound to the contractual obligations they have agreed to. The moral code stops
actors from exploiting their exchange partners through opportunistic behavior. This
way morality supports the functioning of markets by reducing transaction costs.
Another sociological classic, Max
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">Weber (1984)</xref>
        , made morality a cornerstone in his
explanation of macroeconomic development: For him the emergence of modern
western capitalism had an indispensable basis in the moral doctrines of Protestantism.
Wolfgang
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">Streeck (1997</xref>
        : 198) followed this idea by introducing the notion of
“beneficial constraints,” meaning that the performance of an economy “may be improved by
the surrounding society retaining and exercising a right for itself to interfere with the
choice and pursuit of individual preferences.”
However, the conviction that markets need a moral basis has not gone undisputed in
sociology
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Luhmann 1986, 1988)</xref>
        . But more than sociologists, economists have
challenged this position. Most famously the model of the “invisible hand” expresses the
connection of public virtue to private vices and thereby disconnects market outcomes
from morally motivated action.

        It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our
dinner but from their regard to their self-interest.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Smith 1976: 18)</xref>
        1
A famous contemporary expression of the unwanted consequences of morally
motivated behavior in markets is Milton
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">Friedman’s (1973</xref>
        ) dictum that “the social
responsibility of business is to make profits.” According to Friedman, any deviation
from profit maximization is itself morally problematic since the moral task of
economic actors is to maximize economic welfare.
      </p>
      <p>While economists standing in the neo-classical tradition see moral action orientations
as blocking economically efficient outcomes, economists from other theoretical
traditions presume that the logic of self-interest must be moderated by morality in order to
allow for the “common good” or even for the functioning of markets itself. The
institutionalist tradition, and also the new microeconomics, see norms, values and trust as</p>
      <p>
        This reading of Adam Smith reflects the interpretation of his work by proponents of the
neoclassical tradition in economics. Smith scholars have argued pervasively that this is a flawed
interpretation of the Scottish enlightenment philosopher
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(Wight: 2002)</xref>
        . The purpose here,
however, is to present an analytical position that plays an important role in economic
thinking.
indispensable elements of the functioning of markets
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Arrow 1973)</xref>
        . There are
situations where selfishness should be held back by moral principles to achieve superior
outcomes. The reason is that markets themselves are “morally unreliable”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Offe 1989)</xref>
        .
Morality is certainly not the only mechanism by which market failure can be
corrected. Morality does play, however, an important role for overcoming free-riding and
for solving principal-agent problems.
      </p>
      <p>These brief remarks give an impression on the essentially contested role of morality
for market outcomes. The conflict is not one that separates academic disciplines; it
runs through disciplinary lines. My intention in this paper is to critically examine
these positions: Does morality hinder economic efficiency or is morality a necessary
condition for markets to operate? Which problems exactly can be resolved through
morally motivated behavior? And which limitations to economic efficiency are caused
by morality?2
The question of the effects of morality on markets is not only of academic interest. It
is also from the background of recent corporate scandals that morality in business –
or the lack thereof – has become a pressing issue in public debate. Have corporate
managers become more selfish? What institutional or moral safeguards are needed to
prevent the excesses that brought companies like Enron and Worldcom to
bankruptcy?
What I will argue in this paper is that the contested role of morality has its causes in
the indeed profoundly ambivalent consequences that morality has on market
outcomes. Morality allows for the emergence and stabilization of market exchange, but it
is also an action orientation that can block exchange relations that are economically
beneficial. I intend to contribute to a better understanding of this ambivalence by
introducing a taxonomy that distinguishes four different forms of morality-based</p>
      <p>
        In focusing on the economic effects of morality on market outcomes, I will not deal with three
other questions related to morality in the economy. First, I will not discuss the question of the
consequences for economic theory that derive from the inclusion of morality. Amartya
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Sen
(1977)</xref>
        , among others, has shown that morally motivated behavior demands profound
changes of neoclassic economic models since it involves “in a very real sense,
counterpreferential choice, destroying the crucial assumption that a chosen alternative must be better than (or
at least as good as) the others for the person choosing it”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Sen 1977: 33)</xref>
        . The notion of
metapreferences is one well known suggestion to include morality into economic theory
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref19 ref8">(Sen 1977;
Hirschman 1986; Etzioni 1988)</xref>
        . Secondly, I will deal only marginally with the question of
non-economic justifications for “moral systems of exchange”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Biggart / Delbridge 2004)</xref>
        .
Economic efficiency cannot provide by itself justification for certain behaviors or institutional
regulations. To submerge normative questions under the logic of efficiency would be a
categorical mistake. A third question connected to the issue of morality and markets that is not
dealt with here refers to the relationship of morality and institutions. What institutional
support do actors need in order to make it more likely that they will actually act in accordance
with the moral convictions they hold
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref15">(Hirschman 1986; Offe 1989)</xref>
        ?
behavior and try to understand what consequences derive from these types of morally
motivated action. The four forms I will discuss I call “cooperation,” “group
solidarity,” “blocked exchange” and “altruism.” There is a fifth – parasitic – type that I will
call “Trojan altruism.”
By morality I mean that actors act in accordance with some principle which is
oriented (also) toward the well-being of others or the common good and is followed
even if it demands to forgo additional personal profit or utility. Amartya
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Sen (1977)</xref>
        has called this action orientation “commitment.” With reference to the terminology
introduced by Robert
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Frank (1990)</xref>
        , one can formulate: to act morally, an actor must
be willing to engage in “irrational behavior without regret.” “Irrational behavior”
refers to decisions that deviate from individual utility maximization. The “lack of
regret” implies that the behavior was chosen not simply by miscalculation of outcomes
but by a deliberate choice.
      </p>
      <p>My argument is not that the observation of inefficiencies due to moral orientations of
actors gives justifications to change these expressions of value rationality. Instead the
argument is that economies operate within the context of a moral universe that resists
the logic of economic efficiency and that at times this resistance is itself a precondition
for market exchange, while at others it produces inefficiencies.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>A typology of moral behavior in market exchange</title>
      <p>
        Morality can enter into market exchange in four different forms. It can enter by taking
one’s own well-being and the well-being of others into consideration. This I will call
“cooperation.” An important special case of cooperation will be discussed under the
heading of “group solidarity.” The third typological form in which morality can enter
into market exchange is by an action orientation that is entirely non-consequentialist,
i.e. which disregards the welfare effects for ego and alter-ego. This comes closest to
Weber’s (1985) notion of value rationality. I will refer to this as “blocked exchange”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Walzer 1983)</xref>
        . Morality can also enter the decision-making process in the typological
form of ignoring consequences for one’s own well-being but having the well-being of
others in mind. This I will call “altruism.” Finally, the last form is a parasitic way for
morality to enter a decision-making situation. It indicates an action that appears to be
beneficial to others but is in fact primarily advantageous to the actor himself. This
behavior, which is actually immoral, I will call “Trojan altruism.”
      </p>
      <p>Typology of moral action in market exchange</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>Cooperation</title>
        <p>
          By cooperation I refer to a set of reciprocal promises and expectations that guide
exchange relationships in a mutually beneficial way. Such promises and expectations can
become effective through an intersubjectively shared moral code that binds the
behavior of the parties to the exchange. Based on this moral code, market participants will
fulfill their contractual obligations even if it would be advantageous for them not to
do so. They will also disclose relevant information accurately.3 Morality in
“cooperation” can contribute to the solution of prisoner-dilemma situations and
principalagent problems.4 In the prisoner dilemma, all players will achieve a superior outcome
if they cooperate. Effective ethical codes can help to induce cooperative behavior and
thereby contribute to resolve endemic free-rider problems
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref4">(Arrow 1973; Beckert
2002a)</xref>
          . The significance of morality in principal-agent situations is no less important.
It has already been described by Max
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">Weber (1984)</xref>
          in his treatment of the role of
Protestant sects in American business life. Weber observed that sect members are
trusted in business relations disembedded from the local community due to an
effective ethical code that will bind the behavior of the sect member even when conducting
business with complete strangers. Hence the ethical code allows actors to engage in
An increasingly relevant counter-example is fake medication. Particularly in Third World
countries, patients are increasingly confronted with bogus medications that either contain no
active ingredients or even include substances that are poisonous. Pharmaceutical companies
are not only worried about this tendency because it effects their business through a loss in
short term sales, but also because it can lead to market failure due to a loss in customer
confidence in the effectiveness of medications.

depends not only on value convictions, but especially on the concrete structures of social
relations.
mutually beneficial transactions that are otherwise considered too risky and would
not take place. Both parties in the exchange profit. In other words, morality can help
to prevent market failure and thereby increases the efficiency of the system.
Prisoner dilemma situations and principal-agent problems both show little
ambivalence with regard to the consequences of commitment-guided behavior for market
outcomes – morality has almost exclusively positive effects. If the logic described by
George
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Akerlof (1970)</xref>
          for the used car market holds true, then not only the principal
(the buyer of the car) is better off if he or she can rely on the accuracy and
completeness of the information revealed, but also the agent himself is better off. Otherwise the
market would fail to come into existence or more costly monitoring devices would
need to be introduced. The same holds true for labor relations where a lack of any
other motives besides personal gain will have negative effects for productivity
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Akerlof
1984)</xref>
          . A similar argument can be made with regard to professional ethics that are a
coordinating force in the exchange relations between laypeople and expert systems.5
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-5-2">
        <title>Group solidarity</title>
        <p>
          A closely related type of morally guided behavior affecting markets is “group
solidarity.” It is based on the pooling of resources. Group solidarity differs from
“cooperation” by drawing a boundary between those actors covered by the moral obligations
and those not covered by these obligations. Through this boundary of exclusion – or
network closure
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Coleman 1990)</xref>
          – group solidarity achieves an ambivalent status as
the moral principles are only coordinating behavior within the group. Behavior can be
non-moralistic, purely self-interested with regard to the consequences of decisions for
outsiders. Solidarity is a non-universalistic ethic
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Bayertz 1998)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>Looking at social relations within the group, “group solidarity” has characteristics
similar to “cooperation.” It is a mechanism for improvement of one’s own situation
and that of other group members by overcoming free-riding. Solving free-rider
problems is a precondition for the effective pooling of resources. In modern capitalist</p>
        <p>
          The only ambiguity arising in the prisoner dilemma and in principal-agent situations is with
regard to the trust-taker or agent. Particularly when the behavior of the agent cannot be
completely observed by the principals, it might be a more profitable strategy for him or her to
alternate between moral (cooperation) and immoral (defection) strategies. Such mixed
strategies do not necessarily lead to market failure, in part, because the exchange partner does not
have the information to know which strategy the agent actually follows. As experimental
studies in game theory show, there are other strategies besides unconditional cooperation that
have superior pay-offs for the trust-taker (agent) compared to unconditional cooperation. For
the agent it may be sufficient to act partially morally to earn the full benefits of morality.
However, this behavior would not be covered by the notion of morality applied in this paper
according to which moral behavior reflects counter-preferential choices.
economies the union movement is probably the most relevant empirical form of
group solidarity. Unions enhance the workers’ power positions in the industrial
conflict by credibly threatening to withdraw a significant amount of labor from the
production process that cannot be substituted for in the short run. Unions do have the
instrumental goals of negotiating better wage settlements, working conditions or
greater job security. However, as Claus Offe and Helmut Wiesenthal (1985) have
shown, membership mobilization by unions cannot rely exclusively on rational
instrumental motivations, but it must also appeal to a moral obligation to participate,
even if unions want to serve nothing “but the member’s individual utilitarian
interests”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Offe / Wiesenthal 1985: 183)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Commitment-based behavior leading to the pooling of resources can have positive
consequences for the instrumental goals of the group members. Its role in market
efficiency, however, is highly contested. From a market-liberal perspective union
solidarity amounts to a cartel that increases prices for labor and thereby leads to inefficient
equilibria. Based on this claim, unions are seen as being responsible for
unemployment. This argument, however, does not go unchallenged. According to
institutionalist approaches in economics (and sociology), unions do play a constructive role in
markets and general economic welfare by helping to institutionalize industrial
conflict, forcing companies to invest into their competitiveness and increasing consumer
purchasing power
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(e.g. Streeck / Schmitter 1985)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          The positive role of group solidarity has also been demonstrated in research on ethnic
economies
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Portes / Sensenbrenner 1993)</xref>
          . Here network closure can help overcome
market failures that arise through discrimination. This can be exemplified by ethnic
economies in the U.S. In order to be able to start a company, some immigrant groups,
who do not have access to American capital markets, come together in rotating credit
associations, pooling their assets and using them in turn to finance their individual
businesses. This makes it possible to create firms, which otherwise would not have
been established. Though these associations rely on intense reciprocal monitoring of
its members, they are also based on the moral implications of belonging to the same
ethnic group.6 At the same time, non-members of the ethnic group are excluded from
the benefits and thereby discriminated against through ascriptive criteria. This shows
the purely self-interested side of group solidarity with regard to non-members.
Community or family based network closure is, however, by no means unequivocally
positive for the economic well-being of the members of the solidaristic community. If
moral codes demand that economically successful family (or community) members
support less successful members by transferring resources, these resources are not
available for individual business investments. As observed by anthropologists, this can
inhibit economic development and gives rise to avoidance strategies by which

        <p>
          The closure of the community was also a precondition for effective monitoring.
ful entrepreneurs try to circumvent family obligations. One interesting strategy has
been observed in indigenous villages in Ecuador. Male owners of garment and leather
artisan shops convert to Protestantism. By doing so the entrepreneurs “remove
themselves from the host of social obligations for male family heads associated with the
Catholic Church and its local organization”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Portes / Sensenbrenner 1993: 1339)</xref>
          . In
more general terms, this supports Max Weber’s claim that one of the chief causes for
the success of modern Western capitalism was that Protestantism guided economic
exchange away from the close connectedness of economic affairs to social obligations.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">Weber (1986)</xref>
          alluded also to a further problematic consequence of distinguishing
between a morality within the group and an external morality that is characterized by
pure utilitarianism. He found this type of particularism in societies adhering to
Confucianism and saw in it the reason for general mistrust becoming a dominant feature
in all business relations reaching beyond the group’s boundaries. Not morality as such
but a morality that is only valid for the family and the clan was a factor that prevented
the development of extensive exchange relations.

        <title>Blocked exchange</title>
        <p>
          The third type of morally guided behavior in markets I will call – using a term
introduced by Michael
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">Walzer (1983)</xref>
          – “blocked exchange.” Blocked exchange refers to
the prohibition or restriction of the monetary exchange of certain objects or services
based on moral codes. It is the opposite of cooperation where the function of morality
is to enable market transactions. Blocked exchanges prevent the market exchange of
certain goods and services by keeping them outside the market realm.7
Which transactions are blocked changes historically and differs between societies.
Therefore it is not possible to make a finite list of goods and services to which
exchange restrictions apply. Two economically crucial fields where such changes have
occurred are the limitations of charging interest for lending money and the abolition
of slavery. Cultural differences can be seen in religiously motivated taboos on the
consumption of certain food products like pork.
        </p>

likely to be restricted from monetary exchange in modern societies. One category are
exchanges that affect the human body. It is prohibited to buy another person (slavery</p>

          Societies may succeed only incompletely in the enforcement of such blockages. This does not,
however, invalidate the claim that certain exchanges are morally rejected and that subsequent
restrictions do have effects on the way these goods and services are exchanged.
and adoption).8 The commercial sale of body parts for medical reasons is mostly
forbidden (organ markets); in many countries women are prohibited from carrying a
child to term for another, infertile woman (reproductive medicine); and the sale of
sexual services is restricted and even prohibited in many countries (prostitution). A
second realm is the market exchange of political influence and offices. The purchase
of political decisions is called corruption and as such illegal. The third realm are legal
claims and obligations that cannot be purchased or sold. There is no market for
trading criminal punishment. The rights to vote, to freedom of expression or to freely
exercise one’s religious beliefs are all non-marketable.9
In general terms, blocked exchanges are characterized by the separation of the goods
or services that are connected to “sacred” (Durkheim) social values from the
“profane” sphere of the market. It is not instrumental rationality that motivates exchange
blockages but rather value rationality (Weber), i.e., the belief in the value of an action
independent of its consequences for oneself or for others. As Durkheim has argued,
the act of establishing such taboos is an important aspect of the identity of a social
group. This implies that blocked exchanges cannot be explained by their contribution
to economic efficiency. The idea that political decisions and human beings cannot be
bought might have positive economic consequences. Nevertheless, the justification for
prohibiting corruption or abolishing slavery is not based on an economic rationale
but rooted in social values which discredit corruption and slavery on moral grounds.
Even if norms cannot be explained functionally, it is possible to ask for economic
consequences of restrictions on specific exchanges since they do not have merely moral
relevance, but have functional consequences for the economic system as well.
According to Max Weber’s theory of rationalization the (originally religiously motivated)
decoupling of exchange from moral obligations was one of the crucial preconditions
for the development of a modern, functionally differentiated economy. The
dissolution of religious restrictions on money lending, the decoupling of exchange from
particularistic privileges and the development of modern labor markets were among the
most important developments in this process. A case for positive economic effects
stimulated by the decoupling of economic exchange from moral restrictions has been
analyzed by Viviana
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">Zelizer (1979)</xref>
          in her research on the development of the life
insurance industry in nineteenth-century America. This industry was originally blocked
by moral objections, primarily expressed by women, who refused to receive a
“premium” for their husband’s death. For many years this moral conviction blocked the
development of an effective financial instrument for the economic protection of
widows.

          .
It is not possible here to show the consequences of blocked exchanges in detail. This
would demand a close discussion of each morally motivated restriction on market
exchange. What I want to illustrate briefly, however, is that the economic effects of
blocked exchanges show profound ambivalences with regard to individual welfare and
macroeconomic efficiency. While the aforementioned examples point to negative
economic consequences, examples for positive economic effects from restrictions of
market exchange come easily to mind. Such effects can be attributed to the blockage
of the purchasing of political decisions, as can be seen from the examples in
corruption-ridden countries. Also, the restrictions on the use of labor power – for instance
the prohibition of child labor – have positive economic implications regarding the
future productivity of children.
        </p>
        <p>
          One complication with regard to welfare effects derives from the following
paradoxical effect that has been observed in the market for blood
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Titmuss 1971)</xref>
          . The blood
market – and possibly other markets for goods taken from the human body as well –
has an untypical supply curve. The introduction of an exchange market for blood does
not leave the supply of voluntary blood donations unaffected; where blood supply
becomes a commercial activity, donors feel less responsibility to continue donating it.
Hence, monetary compensation leads to a reduction in voluntary supply. This result,
which contradicts economic reasoning, cites economic reasons for organizing blood
donations as a gift.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the prohibition of markets for moral reasons might have unintended side
effects that must be examined. One important aspect is that the prevention of markets
gives way to the emergence of illegal markets that have consequences usually seen as
socially and individually negative. Such markets emerge when not all actors submit to
the morally demanded behavior. This can be observed not only in the case of (illegal)
markets for organs. The prohibition of prostitution undermines the protection of
illegal sex industry workers and makes them especially vulnerable; the prohibition of
certain narcotics leads to the emergence of drug dealers, crime and serious problems
for public health. Through these effects, the morally motivated prohibition of markets
shows profound moral and economic dilemmas.</p>

        <title>Altruism</title>
        <p>
          The fourth type of morally motivated behavior relevant for markets is “altruism.”
Altruism is defined by a voluntary self-commitment to behavior based on value that
inflicts costs on oneself for the benefit of others. Altruism has several forms. The most
economically significant one is the voluntary inclusion of otherwise externalized costs.
This is the core arena of business ethics, fair trade and socially conscientious
consumer choices. If companies voluntarily abstain from hiring child labor, pay living
wages and protect the natural environment in which they operate their plants, they
increase their costs (i.e., their shareholder’s or customer’s costs) for the benefit of
stakeholders like their employees and neighborhood communities. By now, voluntary
codes of conduct have led to the establishment of an international standard on social
accountability (SA 8000). Some large retailers purchase only from manufacturers that
comply with the SA 8000 standard
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Biggart / Delbridge 2004)</xref>
          . This can be seen as an
indicator for an increasing “moralization of markets.”
It is, however, debatable to what extent compliance with standards of social or
environmental accountability does indeed reflect altruism. Companies might simply
attempt to avoid conflicts with important stakeholders by complying with social
accountability standards or create an image as socially conscientious businesses as an
effective argument in their marketing strategies. If profit strategies motivate the
compliance of companies to standards of social and environmental accountability, their
behavior is not covered by the notion of altruism. While the significance of altruism
in business behavior is ultimately an empirical question, two theoretical points can be
made. First, the market mechanism limits the possibility of altruistic choices that
cannot be turned into increased revenues. Managers in a market economy are structurally
forced to orient their decisions towards profit making. Any other behavior will lead to
a loss in profits and a reduction in market share. Second, the role of the market
mechanism does not imply that decisions are determined by the market. Most
organizations do have significant slack that allows for inefficient decisions without
jeopardizing the survival of the company. Moreover, if one assumes that, under conditions of
complexity and fundamental uncertainty of outcomes, managers cannot identify
optimal strategies, the perspective of market determination of business decisions is
flawed. Under such conditions managers will base their decisions on culturally
legitimated conceptualizations of rationality. This constitutive role of culture allows for the
introduction of ethically motivated decisions into firm behavior despite market
pressures towards efficiency
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Beckert 2002b)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of whether it reflects genuine altruism or not, the addition of moral
considerations into the market does change the way business is conducted. Pressure to
find ethically reflective strategies develops mostly as a result of investor and consumer
choices. Investment fund managers might invest only in companies that have
progressive policies towards gays and lesbians or that comply with standards of social
accountability. An interesting example is also the rising field of Islamic banking. Here
investments are only made to companies that comply with “Islamic values”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Biggart/
Delbridge 2004: 39)</xref>
          . This is a form of altruism on the investor’s side if the investor
must assume that his investment will have a lower return because he or she forgoes
more lucrative alternative investment opportunities. Consumers show altruistic action
orientations, for instance, by buying more expensive goods from a neighborhood
store, instead of purchasing from Wal-Mart, because they believe in the value of
having neighborhood stores. Consumer boycotts on the other hand express
condemnation of certain business practices by consumers. Consumers are willing to avoid a
product or store in order to support practices that comply with their values.10
But what are the economic consequences of such altruistic, value directed allocations
of capital and consumer purchasing power? They are costly for the investor or the
consumer in monetary terms. One pays a higher price for bread in the local grocery
store compared to purchasing it from Wal-Mart. One does without apples from South
Africa if they are produced under Apartheid conditions, even if they are a better
economic value. One invests in certain mutual funds even though one expects a lower
rate of return compared to alternative investment opportunities. These are
counterpreferential choices if one assumes selfishness is the standard for economic choices.11
The story becomes more complicated once attention is shifted to the producing firms,
countries and traders that are subject to the value based consumer and investor
choices. A shift in allocation of investment capital and consumer purchasing power
due to altruistic decision-making is beneficial only to those companies, industries or
countries that are favored by the social values. It is economically detrimental to those
parties which are negatively discriminated against. Looking at macroeconomic
consequences, the loading of economic exchange relations with value orientations that are
followed through altruistic decisions may be problematic as well. They might lead to a
particularization of exchange which undermines competition. It contradicts the
functional differentiation of the economy, i.e., its detachment from substantial value
convictions that makes economic exchange non-discriminatory and inclusive. If decisions
are based on altruism, capital is not allocated exclusively under criteria of economic
efficiency. Moreover, any judgment of altruism must consider that, given the complex
interrelations within the economy, effects may be highly unspecific and contaminated
by unintended consequences that may outweigh their positive intentions
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Luhmann
1993: 136)</xref>
          . Boycotts may also hurt those actors whose interests shall be protected.12
Altruism can have similar non-intended effects as the blockage of exchange does.
10 Despite these costs, it is debatable to what extent socially conscientious consumer behavior
qualifies as altruism. Though its declared intention is the principle-based increase of the
welfare of others, this does not exclude the maximization of one’s own utility. This is the case if
the well-being of alter ego forms part of the utility function of ego. This assumes, however,
contrary to standard economic models, that utility functions are not independent. Following
Amartya
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Sen (1977)</xref>
          , such choices can nevertheless be characterized as moral behavior as long
as the personal utility is not the reason for them.
11 These value-oriented allocations of money can be integrated into an economic
decisionmaking model that demands only coherence of choices.
12 Boycotts are morally ambivalent. They might be seen as positive by society if values are
expressed that find widespread acceptance. The act of boycotting products from South Africa
during the Apartheid regime found broad social support. But what if investment is directed to
companies upon the condition that they avoid hiring foreigners or Jews? What about
boycotting Korean groceries in black neighborhoods of Los Angeles? For the moral evaluation of

        <title>Trojan altruism</title>
        <p>A further way in which “morality” can enter markets I want to call “Trojan altruism.”
This is not a type of moral behavior, but refers to the strategic use of substantial value
orientations for one’s own benefit and at the cost of others. Trojan altruism is
deceitful. There are several examples that stand at least under suspicion to form cases of
Trojan altruism. The first one is food aid to Third World countries. Food aid increases
supply in local markets, causes the depreciation of prices and thereby drives local
producers out of the market. It can also contribute to a change in demand by influencing
the taste of consumers and thereby decrease demand for local crops. The dependency
created through the destruction of local agricultural production is at the same time
beneficial to food exporting countries in the developed world.</p>
        <p>The suspicion of Trojan altruism also plays a role in current political discourse about
standards of social and environmental accountability in global production systems.
Codes of social accountability are increasingly honored in business transactions with
Third World suppliers. Prison labor, child labor, sweatshop working conditions and
pollution of the environment are prime issues. The definition of the codes of conduct
takes place mostly in the North. This opens the possibility that the enforcement of a
seemingly morality based standard – for instance the policy not to buy products made
through the use of child labor – is in fact a hidden enforcement of a competitive
disadvantage for Third World countries, implying additional hardship for the poor. In
many countries, child labor is a crucial source of family income and low wages are one
of the few competitive advantages of the economies of the South. The same argument
can be made with regard to standards of environmental protection. To make this
point more systematically: Altruism might reflect a paternalistic definition of interests
of the South13 by people in the North that have little to do with the interests people of
the South actually have. This suspicion of paternalistic definition of interests became
an important dispute between NGOs from the North and the South in the
antiglobalization movement in recent years.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>What can we learn from the proposed distinction of types of moral behavior in
markets? The argument pursued in this paper was that the role of morality for market
outcomes is deeply ambivalent. Market-liberal objections to any type of coordination
truism, the concrete values at stake must be considered. This presupposes a principle for the
regulation of value conflicts.</p>

devices but self-interest don’t do justice to the problems emerging from unequal
initial endowments, monopolistic market structures, external effects, free-riding and
principal-agent problems. This, on the other hand, does not imply that morality based
decision-making can be seen as unequivocally positive for the efficiency of market
outcomes. Morality might be discriminatory to outsiders, hinder the functional
differentiation of the economy and block markets that would be beneficial for at least
some market participants.
      </p>
      <p>These profound ambivalences disqualify all positions of unqualified rejection of
morality as an action orientation of market participants. However, they also pinpoint to
benefits of demoralization of market exchange. The typology introduced identifies
different implications of morality for the efficiency of market outcomes for the
different types. Mostly positive effects can be attributed to cooperation, i.e., moral behavior
in the context of problems associated with free-riding and principal-agent situations.
In these situations, ethical codes are one mechanism by which market failure can be
avoided and more efficient outcomes achieved. By contrast, exchange blockages
appear profoundly ambiguous, as they represent values in a society. As an ideal type,
their enforcement is independent from their consequences for personal utility and
macroeconomic welfare effects. They can nevertheless contribute to economic
wellbeing, for instance by blocking the purchase of political decisions (corruption). They
can, on the other hand, prevent the functional differentiation of the economy and
might result in unintended consequences like the emergence of illegal markets. While
it might be politically decided to reduce the scope of markets by legally blocking the
exchange of certain goods and services, these non-intended consequences must be
reflected in any consequentialist moral judgment of such restrictions. Altruism
transports substantial value orientations into the realm of the economy as well. Its
evaluation depends on the values that are enacted but also on the unintended effects it
causes. Altruism can give moral justification to redistributive policies and thereby
help to integrate the issue of equity into a market economy. Group solidarity has
ambivalent consequences too. It can lead to the cartelization of market exchange and it
excludes outsiders. On the other hand, it can also help stabilize markets, reduce power
differentials between different social groups and help to pool resources for
investments that would otherwise be unobtainable. Finally, Trojan altruism is a parasitic use
of morality that does not find moral legitimation. Its effects are clearly negative, based
on the criterion of Pareto efficiency, since it aims at gaining advantages at the cost of
the other side of the exchange.</p>
      <p>While the typology does not lead to unambiguous distinctions with regard to the
welfare effects of the four specific forms of commitment based behavior, it does provide
insights into the specific problems which are characteristic for the different types.
Moreover, it indicates that the moral embeddedness of the economy is not a
dysfunctional relic from premodern times but rather an integral part of the efficient
functioning of markets. At the same time, the role of morality in the market cannot be reduced
to its economic functions. The observation of inefficiencies due to moral orientations
of actors does not itself give justification to condemn these expressions of value
rationality. Instead, they demonstrate that economies work within the context of a
moral universe that itself cannot be reduced to criteria of economic efficiency. The
ambivalence of morality for market outcomes is due to the fact that markets
necessarily operate within a social field in which economic and non-economic values merge.
This can be beneficial to economic outcomes or inhibit economic efficiency. The
theoretical insight emerging from the ambivalent role of morality on markets is that
no economy will ever be “only economic” even if this inhibits some of its economic
functions.</p>
