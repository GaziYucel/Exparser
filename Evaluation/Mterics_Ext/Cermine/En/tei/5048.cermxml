        <p>All refereed journals will soon be available online; most of them already are. This means that anyone will be able to access them from any networked desk-top. The literature will all be interconnected by citation, author, and keyword/subject links, allowing for unheard-of power and ease of access and navigability. Successive drafts of pre-refereeing preprints will be linked to the official refereed draft, as well as to any subsequent corrections, revisions, updates, comments, responses, and underlying empirical databases, all enhancing the self-correctiveness, interactivity and productivity of scholarly and scientific research and communication in remarkable new ways. New scientometric indicators of digital impact are also emerging (http://opcit.eprints. org) to chart the online course of knowledge. But there is still one last frontier to cross before science reaches the optimal and the inevitable: Just as there is no longer any need for research or researchers to be constrained by the accessblocking restrictions of paper distribution, there is no longer any need to be constrained by the impact-blocking financial fire-walls of Subscription/Site-License/Pay-Per-View (S/L/P) tolls for this give-away literature. Its authors/researchers have always donated their research reports for free (and its</p>

goal of maximizing their impact on subsequent research (by
accessing the eyes and minds of fellow-researchers, present
and future) and hence on society. Generic (OAi-compliant)
software is now available free so that institutions can
immediately create Eprint Archives in which their authors can
self-archive all their refereed (published) papers for free for
all forever (http://www.eprints.org/). These interoperable
Open Archives (http://www.openarchives.org) will then be
harvested into global, jointly searchable "virtual archives"
(e.g., http://arc.cs.odu.edu/). "Scholarly Skywriting" in this
PostGutenberg Galaxy will be dramatically (and
measurably) more interactive and productive, spawning its own new
digital metrics of productivity and impact, allowing for an
online "embryology of knowledge."</p>

      <p>A brand-new PhD recipient proudly tells his mother he has just
published his first article. She asks him how much he was paid for it. He
makes a face and tells her "nothing," and then begins a long,
complicated explanation ...</p>
      <p>A fellow-researcher at that same university sees a reference to that
same article. He goes to their library to get it: "It's not subscribed to
here. We can't afford that journal. (Our subscription/license/loan/copy
budget is already overspent.)"
An undergraduate at that same university sees the same article cited on
the Web. He clicks on it. The publisher's website demands a password:
"Access Denied: Only pre-paid subscribing/licensed institutions have
access to this journal."
The undergraduate loses patience, gets bored, and clicks on Napster to
grab an MP3 file of his favorite bootleg CD to console him in his
sorrows.</p>
      <p>Years later, the same PhD is being considered for tenure. His
publications are good, but they're not cited enough; they have not made enough
of a "research impact." Tenure denied.</p>
      <p>Same thing happens when he tries to get a research grant: His research
findings have not had enough of an impact: Not enough researchers
have read, built upon and cited them. Funding denied.</p>
      <p>He decides to write a book instead. Book publishers decline to publish
it: "It wouldn't sell enough copies because not enough universities have
enough money to pay for it. (Their purchasing budgets are tied up
paying for their inflating annual journal subscription/license/loan costs ...)"
He tries to put his articles up on the Web, free for all, to increase their
impact. His publisher threatens to sue him and his server-provider for
violation of copyright.</p>
      <p>He asks his publisher: "Who is this copyright intended to protect?" His
publisher replies: "You!"
What is wrong with this picture?
(And why is the mother of the PhD whose give-away work people cannot steal,
even though he wants them to, in the same boat as the mother of the recording
artist whose non-give-away work they can and do steal, even though he does
not want them to?)</p>

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>1. Five Essential PostGutenberg Distinctions:</title>
      <p>In order to understand what is wrong with the picture, you first have to make
five critical distinctions. If you fail to make any one of these distinctions, it will
be impossible to make sense of the picture or to resolve the anomaly, an
anomaly completely unique to the online era of "Scholarly Skywriting" (Harnad
1990) in the "PostGutenberg Galaxy" (Harnad 1991).</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>1.1 Distinguish the non-give-away literature from the give-away literature</title>
        <p>
          This is the most important PostGutenberg distinction of all. It is what makes
this small refereed research literature anomalous (about 24,000 refereed
journals, about 2,500,000 articles annually) – fundamentally unlike the bulk of the
written literature: Its authors do not seek, nor do they receive, royalties or fees
for their writings. Their texts are author give-aways (Harnad 1995a). The only
thing these authors seek is research "impact"
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Harnad &amp; Carr 2000)</xref>
          , which
comes from accessing the eyes and minds of all potentially interested
fellowresearchers everywhere, now, and any time in the future.
        </p>
        <p>The litmus test for whether a piece of writing falls in the small give-away
sector of the literature or the much larger non-give-away sector is: "Does the
author seek a royalty or fee in exchange for his writings?" If the answer is yes
(as it is for virtually all books [cf. Harnad, Varian &amp; Parks 2000] and
newspaper or magazine articles), then the writing is non-give-away; if the answer is
no, then it is give-away.</p>
        <p>None of what follows here is applicable to non-give-away writing, but the
non-give-away model is the one that most people have in mind for all of
writing. So it is not surprising that that small fraction of writing that the more
general model does not fit should seem anomalous.</p>
        <p>1.2 Distinguish income (arising from article sales) from
impact (arising from article use)
Unlike all other authors, researchers derive their income not from the sale of
their research reports but from the scholarly/scientific impact of their reported
findings, i.e., how much they are read, cited, and built-upon by other
researchers. Hence all fee-based access-barriers are income-barriers for research and
researchers (Harnad 1998a), restricting their potential impact to only those
(institutions, mainly) who can and do pay the access-fees.</p>
        <p>As most institutions cannot afford the access-fees to most refereed research
journals, this means that most research papers cannot be accessed by most
researchers (Harnad 1998b): Currently, all that potential impact is simply lost.</p>
        <p>Note that although researchers do not derive income from the sale of their
refereed research papers ("imprint income"), they do derive income from the
impact of those papers ("impact income").</p>
        <p>The simple reason why researchers, unlike non-give-away authors, do not
seek imprint-income for their refereed research is that the access-tolls for
collecting imprint-income are barriers to impact-income (research grants, salaries,
promotion, tenure, prizes), which is by far the more important reward for
researchers, most of whose refereed papers are so esoteric (Harnad 1995b) as to
have no imprint-income market at all.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>1.3 Distinguish between copyright protection from</title>
        <p>theft-of-authorship (plagiarism) and copyright protection
from theft-of-text (piracy)
These two very different aspects of copyright protection have always been
conflated (Harnad 1999b), because it is the much larger and more
representative non-give-away literature that has always been the model for copyright law
and copyright concerns. But copyright protection from theft-of-authorship
(plagiarism), which is essential for both give-away and non-give-away authors,
has nothing at all to do with copyright protection from theft-of-text (piracy),
which non-give-away authors want but give-away authors do not want. One
can have full protection from plagiarism without seeking any protection from
piracy.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-3">
        <title>1.4 Distinguish self-publishing (vanity press) from self-archiving (of published, refereed research)</title>
        <p>The essential difference between unrefereed research and refereed research is
quality-control (peer review, Harnad 1998/2000) and its certification (by an
established peer-reviewed journal of known quality). Although researchers
have always wished to give away their refereed research findings, they still
wish them to be refereed, and certified as having met established quality
standards. Hence the self-archiving of refereed research should in no way be
confused with self-publishing, for it includes as its most important component, the
online self-archiving, free for all, of refereed, published research papers.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-4">
        <title>1.5 Distinguish unrefereed preprints from refereed postprints ("eprints" = preprints + postprints)</title>
        <p>Eprint archives, consisting of research papers self-archived online by their
authors, are not, and have never been, merely "preprint archives" for unrefereed
research. Authors can self-archive therein all the embryological stages of the
research they wish to report, from pre-refereeing, through successive revisions,
till the refereed, journal-certified postprint, and thence still further, to any
subsequent corrected, revised, or otherwise updated drafts (post-postprints), as
well as any commentaries or responses linked to them. These are all just
waystations along the scholarly skywriting continuum.</p>
        <p>2. The Optimal and Inevitable for Researchers</p>
        <sec id="sec-4-4-1">
          <title>The entire full-text refereed corpus online</title>

Fully searchable, navigable, retrievable</p>
          <p>For free, for all, forever</p>
          <p>All of this will come to pass. The only real question is "How soon?" Will we
still be compos mentis and fit to benefit from it, or will it only be for the napster
generation? Future historians, posterity, and our own still-born scholarly
impact are already poised to chide us in hindsight (Harnad 1999b).
What can the research community do to hasten the optimal and inevitable?
Here are some recent concepts that may help.</p>
          <p>3. Two Useful Acronyms, One New Distinction,
and One New Ally
3.1 S/L/P [Subscription/Site-License/Pay-Per-View] tolls:</p>
          <p>The impact/access-barriers
Access-tolls are the access-barriers, hence the impact-barriers, for researchers
and their give-away research. Access-tolls are the journal publisher's means of
recovering costs and making a fair profit. High costs were inescapable in the
expensive and inefficient on-paper Gutenberg era; but today, in the on-line
PostGutenberg era, continuing to do it all the old Gutenberg way, with its high
costs, must be clearly seen as the optional add-on (for this give-away literature
only: not for the royalty/fee-based literature!) that it has become, rather than as
the obligatory feature it used to be.</p>
          <p>Beware of the language of obligatory "value-added," with which the
peerreviewed literature must, by implication, continue to be inextricably wrapped.
The only essential service still provided by journal publishers (for this
anomalous, author-give-away literature in the PostGutenberg era) is peer review itself.</p>
          <p>The rest – on-paper versions, PDF on-line page images, deluxe online
enhancements – are all potentially valuable features, to be sure, but only as
takeit-or-leave-it options. In the on-line era there is no longer any necessity, hence
no longer any justification whatsoever, for continuing to hold the refereed
research itself hostage to access-tolls and whatever add-ons they happen to pay
for.</p>
          <p>Beware also of any attempt to trade off S for L or L for P: Pick your poison,
all three are access-barriers, hence impact-barriers, and hence all three must go
– or rather, they must all now become only the price-tags for the add-on, deluxe
options that they buy for the researcher and his institution, but no longer also
for the peer-reviewed essentials, which can now be self-archived for free for
all.</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-5">
        <title>3.2 Peer review</title>
        <p>Peer review itself is not a deluxe add-on for research and researchers: This
quality-control service and its certification is an essential (Harnad 1998/2000).
Without peer review the research literature would be neither reliable nor
navigable, its quality uncontrolled, unfiltered, un-sign-posted, unknown,
unaccountable.</p>
        <p>But the peers who review it for the journals are the researchers themselves,
and they review it for free, just as the researchers report it for free. So it must
be made quite clear that the only real peer-review cost is that of implementing
the peer review, not actually performing it.</p>
        <p>Estimates (e.g., Odlyzko 1998) as well as the real experience of online-only
journals (e.g., Journal of High Energy Physics http://jhep.cern.ch/; Psycoloquy
http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/psycoloquy/) have shown that the peer-review
implementation cost is quite low – about 10-30% of the total amount that the
world's institutional libraries (or rather, the small subset of them that can afford
any given journal at all!) are currently paying annually per article in
accesstolls .</p>
        <p>Once the 70-90% toll-based add-ons become optional, the essential 10-30%
peer-review cost could easily be paid out of the 100% toll savings – if ever the
world's libraries decide they no longer need the add-ons. (The other 70-90%
savings can be used to buy other things, e.g., books, which are not, and never
will be, author give-aways.)
3.3 Separating (i) peer-review service-provision from (ii) eprint
access-provision (and from (iii) optional add-ons)
Researchers need not and should not wait until journal publishers voluntarily
decide to separate the provision of the essential peer-review service from all the
other optional add-on products (on-paper version, publisher's PDF version,
deluxe enhancements) before their give-away refereed research can at last be
freed of all access- and impact-barriers.</p>
        <p>All researchers can free their own refereed research now, virtually
overnight, by taking the matter into their own hands; they can self-archive it in their
institutional Eprint Archives: http://www.eprints.org. Access to the eprints of
their refereed research is then immediately freed of all toll-barriers, forever.</p>
        <p>3.4 Interoperability: The Open Archive Initiative (OAI)
Papers self-archived by their authors in their institutional Eprint Archives can
be accessed by anyone, anywhere, with no need to know their actual location,
because all Eprints Archives are compliant with the Open Archives
Initiative (OAI) meta-data tagging protocol for interoperability: http://www.
openarchives.org.</p>
        <p>Because of their OAI-compliance, the papers in all registered Eprints
Archives can be harvested and searched by Open Archive Services such as
CiteBase (http://cite-base.ecs.soton.ac.uk/help/index.php3) and the Cross Archive
Searching Service (http://arc.cs.odu.edu/), providing seamless access to all the
eprints, across all the Eprint Archives, as if they were all in one global, virtual
archive.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>4. The Subversive Proposal</title>
      <p>4.1 Enough to free entire refereed corpus, forever, immediately
Eight steps will be described here. The first four are not hypothetical in any
way; they are guaranteed to free the entire refereed research literature (~24K
journals annually) from its access/impact-barriers right away. The only thing
that researchers and their institutions need to do is to take these first four steps.
The second four steps are hypothetical predictions, but nothing hinges on them:
The refereed literature will already be free for everyone as a result of steps i-iv,
irrespective of the outcome of predictions v-viii.</p>
      <p>i. Universities install and register OAI-compliant Eprint Archives
(http://www.eprints.org).</p>
      <p>The Eprints software is free and will be open-sourced. It in turn uses only free
software; it is quick and easy to install and maintain; it is OAI-compliant and
will be kept compliant with every OAI upgrade: http://www.openarchives.org/.
Eprints Archives are all interoperable with one another and can hence be
harvested and searched (e.g., http://arc.cs.odu.edu/) as if they were all in one
global "virtual" archive of the entire research literature, both pre- and
postrefereeing.</p>
      <p>ii. Authors self-archive their pre-refereeing preprints and
postrefereeing postprints in their own university's Eprint Archives.
This is the most important step; it is insufficient to create the Eprint Archives.
All researchers must self-archive their papers therein if the literature is to be
freed of its access- and impact-barriers. Self-archiving is quick and easy; it
need only be done once per paper, and the result is permanent, and permanently
and automatically uploadable to upgrades of the Eprint Archives and the
OAIprotocol.</p>
      <p>iii. Universities subsidize a first start-up wave of self-archiving by
proxy where needed.</p>
      <p>
        Self-archiving is quick and easy, but there is no need for it to be held back if
any researcher feels too busy, tired, old or otherwise unable to do it for himself:
Library staff or students can be paid to "self-archive" the first wave of papers
by proxy on their behalf. The cost will be negligibly low per paper, and the
benefits will be huge; moreover, there will be no need for a second wave of
help once the palpable benefits (access and impact) of freeing the literature
begin to be felt by the research community. Self-archiving will become
secondnature to all researchers as the objective digitometric indicators of its effects on
citations and usage become available online (Harna
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">d 2001</xref>
        e; Lawrence 2001a,
2001b) (e.g., cite-base or ResearchIndex).
      </p>
      <p>iv. The give-away corpus is freed from all access /</p>
      <p>impact barriers on-line.</p>
      <p>Once a critical mass of researchers has self-archived, the refereed research
literature is at last free of all access- and impact-barriers, as it was always
destined to be.</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>4.2 Hypothetical sequel</title>
        <p>Steps i-iv are sufficient to free the refereed research literature. We can also
guess at what may happen after that, but these are really just guesses. Nor does
anything depend on their being correct. For even if there is no change
whatsoever – even if Universities continue to spend exactly the same amounts on their
access-toll budgets as they do now – the refereed literature will have been freed
of all access/impact barriers forever.</p>
        <p>However, it is likely that there will be some changes as a consequence of the
freeing of the literature by author/institution self-archiving. This is what those
changes might be:
v. Users will prefer the free version?
It is likely that once a free, online version of the refereed research literature is
available, not only those researchers who could not access it at all before,
because of toll-barriers at their institution, but virtually all researchers will prefer
to use the free online versions.</p>
        <p>Note that it is quite possible that there will always continue to be a market
for the toll-based options (on-paper version, publisher's on-line PDF, deluxe
enhancements) even though most users use the free versions. Nothing hangs on
this.</p>
        <p>vi. Publisher toll revenues shrink, library toll savings grow?
But if researchers do prefer to use the free online literature, it is possible that
libraries may begin to cancel journals, and as their windfall toll savings grow,
journal publisher toll revenues will shrink. The extent of the cancellation will
depend on the extent to which there remains a market for the toll-based
addons, and for how long.</p>
        <p>If the toll-access market stays large enough, nothing else need change.
vii. Publishers downsize to providers of peer-review service and
optional add-ons products?
It will depend entirely on the size of the remaining market for the toll-based
options whether and to what extent journal publishers will have to down-size to
providing only the essentials: The only essential, indispensable service is peer
review.</p>
        <p>viii. Peer-review service costs funded by author-institution out of
reader-institution toll savings?
If publishers can continue to cover costs and make a decent profit from the
tollbased optional add-ons market, without needing to down-size to peer-review
provision alone, nothing much changes.</p>
        <p>But if publishers do need to abandon providing the toll-based products and
to scale down instead to providing only the peer-review service, then
universities, having saved 100% of their annual access-toll budgets, will have plenty of
annual windfall savings from which to pay for their own researchers'
continuing (and essential) annual journal-submission peer-review costs (10-30%); the
rest of their savings (70-90%) they can spend as they like (e.g., on books – plus
a bit for Eprint Archive maintenance).</p>

    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>5. PostGutenberg Copyright Concerns</title>
      <p>There is a great deal of concern about copyright in the digital age, and some of
it may not be easily resolvable (e.g., what to do about the pirating of software
and music). But none of that need detain us here, because digital piracy is only
a problem for non-give-away work, whereas we are concerned here only with
give-away work. (Again, failing to make the give-away/non-give-away
distinction leads only to confusion, and the misapplication of the much bigger and
more representative non-give-away model to the anomalous give-away corpus,
which it does not fit.)
The following digital copyright concerns are relevant to the non-give-away
literature only:</p>
      <sec id="sec-6-1">
        <title>5.1 Protecting intellectual property (royalties)</title>
        <p>This is as much of a concern to authors of books as to authors of screenplays,
music, and computer programs. It is also a concern to performers who have
made digital audio or video disks of their work. They do not wish to see that
work stolen; they want their fair share of the gate-receipts in return for their
talent and efforts in producing the work.</p>
        <p>But the producers of refereed research reports do not wish to have protection
from "theft" of this kind; on the contrary, they wish to encourage it. They have
no royalties to gain from preventing it; they have only research impact to lose
from access-blockage of any kind.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-2">
        <title>5.2 Allowing fair use (user issue)</title>
        <p>"Fair use" is another worthy concern. It has to do with certain sanctioned uses
of non-give-away material, such as all or parts of books, magazine articles, etc.,
often for teaching purposes; the producers of these works do not wish to lose
their potential royalty/fee-income from these works.</p>
        <p>The producers of refereed research reports, in contrast, wish to give their
work away; hence fair-use issues are moot for this special give-away literature.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-3">
        <title>5.3 Preventing theft of text (piracy)</title>
        <p>The producers of refereed research reports do not wish to prevent the theft of
their texts; they wish to facilitate it as much as possible. (In the on-paper era
they used to purchase and mail reprints to requesters at their own expense!)
The following digital copyright concern is relevant to all literature, both
giveaway and non-give-away:</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-4">
        <title>5.4 Preventing theft of authorship (plagiarism)</title>
        <p>No author wants any other author to claim to have been the author of his work.
This concern is shared by all authors, give-away and non-give-away. But it has
nothing whatsoever to do with concerns about theft-of-text, and should not be
conflated with such concerns in any way: Give-away work need not be held
hostage to non-give-away concerns about theft-of-text under the pretext of
"protecting" it from theft-of-authorship. (Unfortunately, many journal
publishers try to write and use their copyright transfer agreements for precisely this
purpose, and authors need to become aware of it.)
The following digital copyright concern is relevant to the give-away literature
only:</p>

        <p>Apart from the protection from plagiarism and the assurance of priority that all
authors seek, the only other "protection" the give-away author of refereed
research reports seeks is protection of his give-away rights!</p>
        <p>(The intuitive model for this is advertisements: what advertiser wants to lose
his right to give away his ads for free, diminishing their potential impact by
charging for access to them!)</p>
        <p>Well, there is no need for the authors of refereed research to worry about
exercising their give-away rights, for they can do it, legally, even under the
most restrictive copyright agreement, by using the following strategy.
6. How to Get Around Restrictive Copyright Legally
("Preprint+Corrigenda Strategy")</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-6">
        <title>6.1 Self-archive the pre-refereeing preprint</title>
        <p>Self-archiving the preprint is the critical first step. Before it has even been
submitted to a journal, your intellectual property is your own, and not bound by
any future copyright transfer agreement. So archive the preprints (as physicists
have done for 10 years now, with over 150,000 papers, and cognitive scientists
have done for 3 years now, with over 1000 papers). This is a good way to
establish priority, elicit informal feedback, and keep a public record of the
embryology of knowledge.
[Note that some journals have, apart from copyright policies, which are a
legal matter,embargo policies," which are merely policy matters (nonlegal).
Invoking the "Ingelfinger (Embargo) Rule," some journals state that they will
not referee (let alone publish) papers that have previously been "made public"
in any way, whether through conferences, press releases, or on-line
selfarchiving. The Ingelfinger Rule, apart from being directly at odds with the
interests of research and researchers and having no intrinsic justification
whatsoever – other than as a way of protecting journals' current revenue streams – is
not a legal matter, and unenforceable. So researchers are best advised to ignore
it completely (Harnad 2000a, 2000b), exactly as the authors of the 150,000
papers in the Physics Archive have been doing for ten years now. The
Ingelfinger Rule is under review by journals in any case; Nature has already dropped it,
and there are indications that Science may soon follow suit too.]</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-7">
        <title>6.2 Submit the preprint for refereeing (revise etc.)</title>
        <p>Nothing changes in author publication practises; nothing needs to be given up.
Submit your preprint to the refereed journal of your choice, and revise it as
usual in accordance with the directive of the Editor and the advice of the
referees.</p>
        <p>6.3 At acceptance, try to fix the copyright transfer agreement
to allow self-archiving
Copyright transfer agreements take many forms. Whatever the wording is, if it
does not explicitly permit online self-archiving, modify it so that it does. Here
is a sample way to word it (http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/copyright.html):
I hereby transfer to [publisher or journal] all rights to sell or lease the text
(onpaper and on-line) of my paper [paper-title]. I retain only the right to distribute
it for free for scholarly/scientific purposes, in particular, the right to
selfarchive it publicly online on the Web.</p>
        <p>Some publishers (about 10-30%) already explicitly allow self-archiving of
the refereed postprint (e.g., the American Physical Society: http://forms.aps.
org/author/copytrnsfr.pdf). Most other publishers (perhaps 70%) also accept
this clause, but only if you explicitly propose it yourself (they will not
formulate it on their own initiative).
6.4 If 6.3 is successful, self-archive the refereed postprint
Hence, for about 80% of journals, once you have done the above, you can go
ahead and self-archive your paper.</p>
        <p>Some journals (about 20%), however, will respond that they decline to
publish your paper unless you sign their copyright transfer agreement verbatim. In
such cases, sign their agreement and proceed to the next step:</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-8">
        <title>6.5 If 6.3 is unsuccessful, archive the"corrigenda"</title>
        <p>Your pre-refereeing preprint has already been self-archived since prior to
submission, and is not covered by the copyright agreement, which pertains to the
revised final ("value-added") draft. Hence all you need to do is to self-archive a
further file, linked to the archived preprint, which simply lists the corrections
that the reader may wish to make in order to conform the preprint to the
refereed, accepted version.</p>
        <p>Everyone chuckles at this point, but the reason it is so easy is that this is the
author give-away literature. No non-give-away author would ever dream of
doing such a thing (archiving the prepublication draft for free, along with the
corrigenda). And copyright agreements (and copyright law) are designed and
conceived to meet the much more representative interests of non-give-away
authors and their much larger body of royalty/fee-based work. Hence this
simple and legal expedient for the special, tiny, anomalous, give-away literature
has no constituency anywhere else.</p>
        <p>
          Yet this simple, risible strategy is also feasible, an
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">d legal (Oppenheim 2001</xref>
          )
– and sufficient to free the entire current refereed corpus of all access/impact
barriers immediately!
7. What You Can Do Now to Free the Refereed Literature
        </p>
        <p>Online
7.1 Researchers: Self-archive all present, future (&amp; past) papers
The freeing of their present and future refereed research from all access- and
impact-barriers forever is now entirely in the hands of researchers. Posterity is
looking over our shoulders, and will not judge us flatteringly if we continue to
delay the optimal and inevitable needlessly, now that it is clearly within our
reach. Physicists have already shown the way, but at their current
selfarchiving rate, even they will take another decade to free the entire Physics
literature (http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/Tim/sld002.htm) – with
the Cognitive Sciences (http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk) 39 times slower still, and
most of the remaining disciplines not even started: http://www.cogsci.
soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/Tim/sld004.htm.</p>
        <p>This is why it is hoped that (with the help of the eprints.org institutional
archive-creating software) distributed, institution-based self-archiving, as a
powerful and natural complement to central, discipline-based self-archiving, will
now broaden and accelerate the self-archiving initiative, putting us all over the
top at last, with the entire distributed corpus integrated by the glue of
interoperability (http://www.openarchives.org).</p>
        <p>As to the past (retrospective) literature: The preprint+corrigenda strategy
will not work there, but as the retrospective journal literature brings virtually
no revenue, most publishers will agree to author self-archiving after a sufficient
period (six months to two years) has elapsed. Moreover, for the really old
literature, it is not clear that on-line self-archiving was covered by the old
copyright agreements at all.</p>
        <p>And if all else fails for the retrospective literature, a variant of the
preprint+corrigenda strategy will still work: Simply do a revised 2nd edition!
Update the references, rearrange the text (and add more text and data if you
wish). For the record, the enhanced draft can be accompanied by a
"decorrigenda" file, stating which of the enhancements were not in the published
version.</p>
        <p>(And of course the starting point for the revised, enhanced 2nd edition, if
you no longer have the digital text in your word processor, can be scanned and
OCR'd from the journal; by thus distributing it, authors can do for their own
work for-free what JSTOR http://www.jstor.org/ is only able to do for the work
of others for-fee.)
7.2 Universities: Install Eprint Archives, mandate them;
help in author start-up
Universities should create institutional Eprint Archives (e.g., CalTech) for all
their researchers. They should also mandate that they be filled. http://www.
eprints.org/signup/sign.php It is already becoming normal practise for faculty
to keep and update their institutional CVs online on the Web; it should be made
standard practise that all CV entries for refereed journal articles are linked to
their archived full-text version in the university's Eprint Archive.</p>
        <p>For researchers who profess to be too busy, tired, old, or inexpert to
selfarchive their papers for themselves, a modest start-up budget to pay library
experts or students to do it for them would be a small amount of money very
well-invested. It will only be needed to get the first wave over the top; from
then on, the momentum from the enhanced access and impact will maintain
itself, and self-archiving will become as standard a practise as email.</p>
        <p>
          But what needs energetic initial promotion and support is the first wave. If
(i) the enhanced access of their own researchers to the research of others and
(ii) the enhance
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">d visibility (Lawrence 2001</xref>
          a, 2001b) and the resulting
enhanced impact of their own research on the research of others are not incentive
enough for universities to promote and support the self-archiving initiative
energetically, they should also consider that it will be an investment in (iii) a
potential solution to their serials crisis and the possible recovery of 70-90% of
their annual serials (toll-access) budget.
        </p>
        <p>(Note that the success of the self-archiving initiative is predicated on the
same Golden Rule on which both refereeing and research themselves are
predicated: If we all do our own part for one another, we all benefit from it. Give in
order to receive ...)
7.3 Libraries: Maintain the University Eprint Archives; help in
author start-up
Libraries are the most natural allies of researchers in the self-archiving
initiative to free the refereed journal literature. Not only are they groaning under the
yoke of the growing serials budget crisis, but librarians are also eager to
establish a new digital niche for themselves, once the journal corpus is on-line:
Maintaining the Eprint Archives, and facilitating the all-important start-up
wave of self-archiving (by being ready to do "proxy" self-archiving on behalf
of authors who feel they cannot do it for themselves), will be a critical role for
libraries to play.</p>
        <p>Libraries can also facilitate a stable transition through their collective,
consortial power (SPARC: http://www.arl.org/sparc), providing leveraged support
for publishers who are prepared to commit themselves to a scheduled for
downsizing to the essentials only (the peer review service, to the
author/institution). And individually they can also be preparing in advance for the
restructuring that will come if their windfall toll savings grow; about 10-30%
of their annual savings will need to be redirected to cover their university's own
authors' peer-review charges per paper. The remaining 70-90% is theirs to use
in any way they see fit!
7.4 Students: Stay the course! Surf! The future is optimal,
inevitable and yours!
Students are well-advised to keep doing what they do naturally: Favor material
that is freely accessible on the Web. This will not net them very much of the
non-give-away literature, but it will put consumer pressure on the give-away
research literature, especially as these students come of age, and become
researchers in their turn.
7.5 Publishers: Concede graciously on self-archiving and be
prepared to separate essential peer-review service costs
(to the author-institution) from optional add-on product costs
(to the reader-institution)
Publishers should concede graciously on self-archiving as the American
Physical Society (APS) has done and not try to use copyright or embargo policy to
prevent or retard it. Such measures are in direct conflict with the interests of
research and researchers, they are destined to fail, they can already be legally
circumvented, and they only make publishers look bad.</p>
        <p>A much better policy is to concede on the optimal and inevitable for
research, and plan on the possibility of separating the provision of the essential
peer review service to the author-institution (peer review implementation
charges, per paper) from the provision of all other add-on products (e.g.,
onpaper version, on-line version, other added-values), which should be sold as
options, rather than used to try to keep holding the essentials (the refereed final
draft) hostage to access-tolls.</p>
        <p>There will still be a permanent niche for journal publishers. What remains to
be seen is whether that will entail downsizing to peer-review service-provision
alone, or whether there will also continue to be a market for toll-based add-ons
even after the refereed drafts are available free through the Eprint Archives.
7.6 Government/society: Mandate public archiving of
public research worldwide
Government and society should support the self-archiving initiative, reminding
themselves that most of this giveaway research has been supported by public
funds, with the support explicitly conditional on making the research findings
public (http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/281/5382/1459). In the
PostGutenberg Galaxy there is no longer any need for that public accessibility
to be blocked by toll-barriers.</p>
        <p>The beneficiaries will not just be research and researchers, but society itself,
inasmuch as research is supported because of its potential benefits to society.
Researchers in developing countries and at the less affluent universities and
research institutions of developed countries will benefit even more from
barrier-free access to the research literature than will the better-off institutions, but
it is instructive to remind ourselves that even the most affluent institutional
libraries cannot afford most of the refereed journals! None have access to more
than a small subset of the entire annual corpus (http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/
arl/index.html). So free access to it all will benefit all institutions (Odlyzko
1999a, 1999b).</p>
        <p>
          And on the other side of barrier-free access to the work of others, all
researchers, even the most affluent, will benefit from the barrier-free impact of
their own work on the work of others. Moreover, a freed, interoperable, digital
research literature will not only radically enhance access, navigation (e.g.,
citation-linking) and impact, hence research productivity and quality, but it will
also spawn new ways of monitoring and measuring that impact, productivity
and quality (e.g., download impact, links, immediacy, comments, and the
higher-order dynamics of a citation-linked corpus that can be analyzed from
preprint to post-postprint, to yield an "embryology of knowledge"

        <p>8. Prima-Facie FAQs for Overcoming Zeno's Paralysis
"I worry about self-archiving because ...":
Researchers, librarians, publishers and university administrators have so far
been held back from self-archiving by certain prima facie worries, all of which
are easily shown to be groundless.</p>
        <sec id="sec-6-8-1">
          <title>These worries are rather like "Zeno's Paradox":</title>
          <p>"I cannot walk across this room, because before I can walk across it, I must
first walk half-way across it, and that takes time; but before I can walk
halfway across it, I must walk half-half-way across it, and that too takes time; and
so on; so I how can I ever even get started?"
This condition might better be called "Zeno's Paralysis."</p>
          <p>Each of the following worries can easily be shown to be groundless (and has
been shown to be groundless, by myself and many others, many times). Yet the
very same prima facie worries keep resurging elsewhere, like mushrooms, no
matter how decisively they are uprooted in each instance. It will be a matter for
future historians to explain the puzzle of why we were needlessly held back for
so long from the optimal and inevitable even when it was well within reach, by
these gratuitous worries (despite the "Los Alamos Lemma," which is that
whatever alleged obstacle was not sufficient to deter physicists from self-archiving
130,000 papers to date should not be holding back the rest of us either!).</p>
          <p>Here are rebuttals to the most common of these prima facie worries; in
future they can be used as FAQs to reply by number: They are brief and to the
point, because there are no long, complex, hidden issues in any of these cases.
Hence it is best to get to the point in the simplest, most direct way possible.
There is also a good deal of overlap and redundancy between them:</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-9">
        <title>8.1 Preservation</title>
        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because archived eprints may not continue to
exist or to be accessible in perpetuo on-line, the way they were on-paper."
To put this worry into perspective, we must remember that print-on-paper is
not permanent either. The only relevant parameter is the probability of future
access. The on-paper probability, such as it is, is achieved by generating (a)
multiple copies, (b) geographically distributed, (c) in a (relatively) robust
medium, (d) visible to the human eye.</p>
        <p>All four of these properties can be (and have been) achieved on-line too, and
the resulting preservation probability can be made as good as, or even better
than, the current probability on-paper.</p>
        <p>That should be the end of the story: For once this concern is no longer
grounded in actual, objective probabilities, but only in prior habits and
attendant intuitions, then we are talking about biases and superstitions and not about
actual risks.</p>
        <p>There are a few side issues: People worry about global power-failures, or
global dictatorships. They should remind themselves that these are matters of
probability too, and have their equivalents in paper.</p>
        <p>People also, by analogy with current unreadable documents in obsolete
word-processors or peripherals, worry about whether the digital code, even if
preserved, will always be accessible and visible to the eye.</p>
        <p>The answer is again probability: The reason print-on-paper has been
faithfully preserved across generations (when it has been) is that the literate world's
collective interests were vested in ensuring that it should do so. This same
continuity of collective interests will exist for the digital corpus too, for the
same reasons, except that digital code will be much easier to keep uploading to
every successive new technology than print on-paper to every successive
building or regime ever was.</p>
        <p>(And there is always the option for those who are still not confident enough
in the technology, despite the odds, of printing out hard copies as back-up:
Indeed, that is a good way to put the magnitude of one's Zeno's worries to the
test: Who will still feel the need to make hard copies, and of how much of the
corpus, once it's all on-line and accessible to everyone, everywhere, at all
times?)</p>
        <p>In short, preservation measures as a practical pursuit by digital librarians is
an eminently worthy one; but as a basis for any hesitation or delay whatsoever
about proceeding with self-archiving right now, it is completely irrational
(particularly as, for the time being, self-archiving is merely a supplement to, not a
substitute for, the existing Gutenberg modes of preservation).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-10">
        <title>8.2 Authentication</title>
        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because you can never be sure whether you are
reading the definitive version of an eprint on-line, the way you can be sure
onpaper."</p>
        <p>Again, the rational way to put this into context and proportion is to remind
ourselves that the authenticity of an on-paper version is just a matter of
probability too, and that the very same factors that maximize that probability
onpaper can maximize it on-line too. Indeed, if we wish, we can make both the
probability and the verifiability of authenticity on-line much higher than it
currently is on-paper through techniques such as public hash/time-stamping
and encryption.</p>
        <p>Nor should the authentication issue be confused with the issue of
peerreview (8.7) or journal certification (8.5) (separate questions), nor with the
question of "version control" (there will be self-archived preprints, revised
drafts, final accepted, published drafts [postprints], updated, corrected
postpostprints, peer comments, author replies, revised second editions. In all of this,
the refereed, accepted final draft is one crucial "milestone," but not the only
one, in the embryology of knowledge [and not even always the best one]).</p>
        <p>And last, some of the "authentication" worries arise from conflating
selfarchiving and self-publication. To say it in longhand: The main objective of the
self-archiving initiative is the freeing of the refereed drafts from access/impact
barriers. The refereed draft has already been "authenticated" by the journal that
peer-reviewed it. Do not confuse that authentication with some worry you may
have about whether this self-archived draft is indeed what the author purports it
to be. The only thing the author is "self-certifying" in this case is that this is
indeed the journal-certified final draft. There is of course always a possibility
that it is not the journal-certified final draft; but that was also true when the
author sent you an on-paper reprint. The probabilities can, as usual, be
tightened to make them as high as we feel comfortable with in either case. And in
the case of preservation, self-archiving is at this stage merely a supplement, not
a substitute for existing forms of authentication.</p>
        <p>So, again, there are no rational authentication concerns whatsoever to deter
us from self-archiving immediately.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-11">
        <title>8.3 Corruption</title>
        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because eprints can be altered or otherwise
corrupted on-line in ways they could not be corrupted on-paper."</p>
        <p>If the "authentication" worry (8.2) is the worry about "self-corruption" by
the author who has self-archived his own paper, this second "corruption" worry
is about "allo-corruption" by parties other than the author.</p>
        <p>Again, the answer is that simple and effective means are available to ensure
that an on-line draft is uncorrupted with as high a probability as we feel we
need. So this too is a non-problem. (Nor should it, again, be conflated with
selfpublication issues, which are irrelevant to the self-archiving of refereed,
journal-published papers.) Whatever level of incorruptibility we feel we need, we
can have it for self-archived papers too.</p>
        <p>Consequently, corruptibility worries provide no rational basis whatsoever
for deterring us from self-archiving immediately.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-12">
        <title>8.4 Navigation (info-glut)</title>
        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because there is already too much to read, and it
is already too hard to navigate it on paper; adding eprints will just make this
situation even worse."</p>
        <p>
          This worry deserves even less space than the others. It is incontestable that
the information glut (http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/how-much-info/summary.
html) is far more navigable and manageable on-line than on-paper
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Harnad &amp;
Carr 2000)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>The primary objective of self-archiving is to free the refereed journal
literature from access-tolls on-line. That literature is already being published
onpaper. (If you think it should not be, it is with the journals and their referees
that you need to take issue, not with self-archiving or the on-line medium!)
When it is all accessible free on-line, there is no need for anyone to feel any
more (or less) obliged to read the refereed literature than they did on-paper.
Keeping it off-line is certainly no cure for the information glut (if there is one);
it merely makes the existing access-tolls the arbitrary arbiters of whether or not
one reads something, rather than the reader's own rational judgement. (And
unrefereed preprints can of course always be ignored altogether, if the reader
wishes, on-line just as on-paper.)</p>
        <p>In short, no rational deterrent at all to immediate self-archiving from
concerns about navigation or information glut.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-13">
        <title>8.5 Certification</title>
        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because papers are not certified on-line, the way
they are in a journal on-paper."</p>
        <p>This worry is again based on conflating publication and archiving: The
journal publisher (and referees) certify; the archive merely provides access. The
author, in self-archiving, "self-certifies" his refereed, published draft as indeed
being the one that the journal refereed and published. And this being the case
is, as usual, a matter of probability, whether on-line or on-paper. And that
probability can be made as high as we feel we need.</p>
        <p>Again, no rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in the certification
worry.</p>
        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because there is no evaluative process on-line as
there is on-paper."</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-14">
        <title>8.6 Evaluation</title>
        <p>Again, a conflation of publishing and archiving: Journal editors and their
referees evaluate drafts and revisions, and if/when they are satisfied that their
journal's quality standards have been met, they certify the final draft as having
met them (peer review). The author self-archives the peer-reviewed postprints
(and unrefereed preprints, and perhaps revised post-postprints), tagging them
correspondingly. We can decide how high a probability we need that the
peerreviewed draft is indeed the peer-reviewed draft, but that is not the problem of
evaluation, but just the question of authentication (8.2) again.</p>
        <p>So there is no rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving anywhere in the
evaluation worry.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-15">
        <title>8.7 Peer review</title>
        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because on-line eprints are not refereed, as they
are on-paper: What will become of peer review?"</p>
        <p>Again, a conflation of publishing and archiving: The author self-archives
both pre-refereeing preprints and refereed postprints (etc.). The peer review
continues to be performed by the referees, as it always was. Peer-review is
medium-independent.</p>
        <p>No rational deterrent to immediate self-archiving in the peer-review worry.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-16">
        <title>8.8 Paying the piper</title>
        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because someone surely has to pay for all this:
you can't get something for nothing!"</p>
        <p>There are many fallacies embedded in this worry, among them
misunderstandings about the nature of global networked communication. Internet
connectivity, at very low cost, is now part of the infrastructure of most of the
world's universities and research institutions. If you are not equally worried
about who pays for your emails, websites, and web-browsing, you should not
be worrying about your self-archiving either. In any case, paying access-tolls is
not paying the pertinent piper here anyway!</p>
        <p>The refereed research literature is minuscule compared to the rest of the
traffic on the Web (http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/how-much-info/summary.html).
It is the flea on the tail of the dog. Worry about the storage and band-width for
the growing daily creation and use of audio, video, and multimedia (most of it
non-research use!) by researchers at universities and research institutions
before even beginning to fret about the refereed flea. As usual, there is also some
of the archiving/publishing conflation here, thinking that we must find some
sort of counterpart for the printing/distribution costs, somewhere. But there isn't
any. The price per-paper of permanent online archiving is virtually zero, yet
everyone, everywhere, has access to it all, forever. This is a Gutenberg expense
that has simply vanished in the PostGutenberg Galaxy, leaving only the
Cheshire Cat's Grin.</p>
        <p>There is indeed one essential publishing cost that still needs to be paid, but it
has nothing to do with Internet use: It is the cost of implementing peer review.
That cost, however, as discussed in the peer peview section (3.3), is only
1030% of the access-toll costs currently being paid, and hence could easily be
paid out of the annual savings.</p>
        <p>The last of the "who-pays-the-piper" worries is, I think, a variant of the
capitalism (8.14) worry. The best way to dispel it is to note that refereed publishing
in the PostGutenberg Galaxy, once the literature has been freed through
selfarchiving, is likely (apart from whatever optional add-on products and services
there may still be a market for) to downsize into a service (peer review),
provided to the author-institution, instead of the toll-based product (the text) that
was provided to the reader-institution in the Gutenberg era.</p>
        <p>Nothing hinges on this, however, for as long as the world wants to keep
paying for the toll-based product, even after the refereed literature has been
selfarchived, the piper will be fully paid, yet the literature will be free of all its
access/impact barriers.</p>

        <title>8.9 Downsizing</title>
        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because it may force journal publishers to shrink
to a non-sustainable size, and then where would we be?"</p>
        <p>No one can predict with certainty the evolutionary path that
scientific/scholarly journal publishing will take once the refereed corpus has been
freed online by self-archiving. The toll-based market for the on-paper version,
for the publisher's on-line version or for other options may continue
indefinitely, or it might shrink but re-stabilize at a lower level, or it might disappear
altogether – and this could happen relatively slowly or relatively quickly.</p>
        <p>It is not clear in advance which of the current established journal publishers
will want to continue doing what, under what conditions. The bottom line is
that the only remaining essential service will be peer review. If and when that
is the only service for which there remains a market, either current journal
publishers will be able and willing to downsize to that niche, or they will
terminate journal operations, in which case their titles (that is, each journal's
editor, editorial board, referees, and authorship) will simply migrate to new
online only journal publishers who are ready to adapt to the new niche [e.g., the
Institute of Physics's New Journal of Physics (http://www.njp.org/) and
BioMed Central (http://www.biomedcentral.com/)].</p>

        <p>In brief, many journals will agree to author self-archiving if the author asks,
and for those that don't, self-archiving the preprint before submission and a
"corrigenda" file after acceptance is sufficient, and completely legal. What
career and livelihood depend on is peer review and impact, and all
selfarchiving authors continue to have both; neither needs to be sacrificed for the

        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because it is so much easier to steal someone
else's text on-line, and publish it as one's own, than it is to do so on-paper."
This is again a matter of probability: Yes, "it is much easier to steal someone
else's text on-line, and publish it as one's own, than it is to do so on-paper," but
it is also much easier to detect such thefts on-line; and it is possible to do both
(steal and detect) on-paper too.</p>
        <p>Depending on how important we find it to do so, we can make escape from
detection so improbable on-line that it becomes harder to plagiarize on-line
than on-paper. It is not clear, however, whether it is even all that important to
do so. Worries about plagiarism are usual based on the archiving/publishing
conflation: Once one's findings have been refereed and published, it is hard for
anyone else to derive any benefit from them at the expense of the author (the
peer-reviewed version settles all subsequent authorship disputes).</p>
        <p>Pre-refereeing preprints are another story; they are dealt with partly in the
prior discussion of authentication (8.2), and partly under priority (8.12), below.</p>
        <p>For refereed postprints, however, refraining from self-archiving them
because of worries about plagiarism would be no more rational than refraining
from publishing them on-paper in the first place, for the very same reason.</p>

conflation (casting the Web and the archive in the role of a publisher who
refuses to publish your work).</p>
        <p>It is true that one's on-line literary goods are at the mercy of the archives and
archivists. But one's analog on-paper literary goods were likewise at the mercy
of the libraries. They could have chosen to "censor" our work too.</p>
        <p>Again, it is just a matter of deciding how tight we wish to make the
probabilities in this medium. Mirroring, caching/harvesting and distributed coding

        <p>"I worry about self-archiving because access-tolls are hallmarks of capitalism,
market economics, supply and demand, free enterprise. Give-aways smack
either of socialism, or market interference, or non-sustainability."</p>
        <p>This too is merely a superstition. There are plenty of perfectly capitalistic
precedents for give-aways, advertising being the most prominent one. If the
thought of advertisers curtailing the potential impact of their ads by charging
potential customers for access to them makes no sense, then it makes just as
little sense to curtail the potential impact of research by charging potential
users for access to them.</p>
        <p>Nor is there any market interference in self-archiving one's own refereed
research: If institutions and individuals want to pay for toll-access to the on-paper
version, or the publisher's PDF, or further options, they can still do so; but there
is no longer any need or justification for continuing to hold the essentials (the
peer-reviewed draft) hostage to those toll-based options in the PostGutenberg
era, any more than there was any need or justification for continuing to hold the
essentials of long-distance communication hostage to postal transport costs in
the era of telephony. (Rather than capitalism being under assault from
selfarchiving, trying to prevent researchers from benefiting from this new, more
efficient and economical way of disseminating and maximizing the impact of
their refereed research smacks of protectionism.)</p>
        <p>Two variants on the capitalism-worry arise from scepticism about the
eventual transition from providing an toll-based product to the reader-institution to
providing a peer-review service to the author-institution. Note that, strictly
speaking, it is not even necessary to answer these worries, as this eventual
transition is hypothetical, whereas freeing the refereed literature now through
self-archiving is not; but here are replies anyway:</p>
        <p>Question 1: "Won't paying directly for the peer-review service lead to
inflated peer-review costs by the most prestigious journals?"</p>
        <p>Question 2: "Won't peer-review revenues lower standards, so that
lowerquality work is accepted in order to get more peer-review revenue?"</p>
        <p>The answer to both is similar: Referees referee for free, and journal quality
and prestige (and impact) depend on rejection rates. Trying to inflate revenue
by lowering acceptance thresholds simply lowers quality, thereby favoring the
competition, with higher standards. It is a built in counter-weight. Likewise for
raising peer-review rates: As referees referee for free, there is no reason one
journal should charge more than another, and if they do, they risk driving not
only the authors but the unpaid referees to the competition. Because the
competitive commodity in this anomalous give-away domain is quality, and
nothing else.</p>
        <p>A proposal has occasionally been voiced to keep preserve toll-barriers by
buying authors off from self-archiving, by offering to share the revenue with
them (royalty payments). But the trade-off between imprint-income and
impact-income is so disproportionate for this anomalous domain that there is not
faintly enough money available to make others prefer sacrificing their potential
impact in exchange.</p>

        <p>At the moment it is undeniable that for extended, discursive reading,
onpaper is still preferable to on-line. This will no doubt change, but even now it is
no reason whatsoever for not self-archiving. First, a large proportion of the
scientific and scholarly use of the refereed research literature consists of
browsing and searching, not linear reading, and for this, on-line navigation is already
incomparably superior. Second, there is still that vast potential readership to
consider, whose access to your research in any form is currently blocked by
unaffordable access-tolls (Odlyzko 1999a, 1999b; http://www.arl.org/
stats/index.html); for that entire disenfranchised population, it's either online or

decide whether or not they feel they need to access the deluxe hard copy; no
need to make a pre-emptive decision on their behalf, as the on-line version is in
any case a supplement, not a substitute, for the time being. And graphics are

their new PostGutenberg niche can do so. New online-only journal publishers
are ready to take over the titles in the cases where they are not. The remaining
peer-review service costs per submitted paper can be paid for by the
authorinstitution out of 10-30% of its annual 100% toll savings. And refereed journal
publication is only a small portion of publication, most of the rest of which,
being non-give-away, will proceed on-line much the way it does on-paper.</p>

        <p>The serials literature is all going on-line anyway, irrespective of the speed or
success of the self-archiving initiative. If this requires restructuring of some
librarian skills and functions, this will take place in any case. Some have
thought that managing digital serials collections will fill the gap, but it is not
clear how much management those will need, apart from paying the annual
toll-bills! Author/institution Eprint Archives, on the other hand, will call for
more digital librarian skills, in everything from helping researchers to do the
self-archiving, to maintaining the institution's Eprint Archive and seeing to its
continued interoperability with the rest of the world's Eprint Archives, its
upgrading, and its preservation.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in implementing and maintaining the institutional Eprint
Archives, Libraries will be investing in the solution of their serials crisis. Of the
100% annual toll budget that this can potentially save, after 10-30% of it has
been redirected to cover author-institution peer-review costs, the remaining

hear rationalizations about needing the toll revenues to fund "good works" such
as meetings, scholarships and lobbying. But it will quickly become evident
that, on the one hand, some of these good works are not essentials either, and
certainly nothing that we would want to sacrifice research impact for; and the
subset of them that really is essential (such as meetings) will prove to be able to
fund itself other ways too, rather than needing to be subsidized at the expense
of research impact.</p>

        <p>We should not forget that the give-away refereed literature is esoteric, with
virtually no "market" per paper. So whereas there might be a basis for
suspicion about what our hard-pressed universities might like to do if they could get
their hands on our exoteric, non-give-away work (royalty-bearing books and
textbooks), there's not much they could do to squeeze revenue out of our
nomarket, give-away refereed research reports even if they wanted to. On the
contrary, our universities, like ourselves, benefit far more from the potential
impact-income of such work – maximized by removing all access-barriers –
than from any potential imprint-income that could be squeezed out of it by
coopting the "P" from the publishers' S/L/P tolls and using it to charge
institutional archive access-tolls.</p>
        <p>Moreover, our universities' potential toll savings, and relief from their
serials crises, are completely dependent on freeing access to our research. Any sign
of university-levied archive-access tolls would simply serve to keep the current
access-tolls in place.</p>

        <p>APPENDIX A: Eprints.org Software for Creating Institutional
and Individual Open Archives
At the 2nd Open Archive Initiative (OAI) meeting in San Antonio in June
(http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june00/06inbrief.html#FOX) a participant said:
"Open Archiving will not get off the ground until the day I can go to a
website, download open-archiving software, then say MAKE ARCHIVE, and an
interoperable, OAI-compliant archive is up and running, ready to be filled."
At Southampton, we took this to heart, and applying our experience with the
CogPrints archive, designed the generic eprints.org software that fits this bill. A
public beta version has been released and has taken over operations at the
CogPrints site (http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/). The operational release (December
2000) is free and will be open sourced (and over 100 prospective users
worldwide are already signed up).</p>
        <p>The eprints.org software is a feature-rich, easily installed, eprint archive
system. It runs right "out of the box" with a comprehensive default setup that
should serve most institutions' and individuals' needs as it stands. It has also
been designed to make it extensively and flexibly re-configurable for
customised needs; almost any aspect of the archive's operation can be adapted to suit a
particular requirement.</p>
        <p>The archive supports the OAI protocol, allowing it to interoperate with other
open archives and open archive services, and to be readily upgraded to keep up
with OAI revisions.</p>
        <p>This adaptability is achieved by using a modular design methodology. The
system is divided into two main components: The core archive component,
which provides the functionality required for all open archives, and the
sitespecific component, providing details about exactly what is stored in the
archive, how it is presented and how it may be searched. The system is supplied
with a richly featured site-specific component that requires minimal changing
to set up a fully working, interoperable open archive. When updated revisions
of the software become available, the core archive component can be upgraded,
and the site retains its identity and data in the site-specific component.</p>
        <sec id="sec-7-5-1">
          <title>1. The many aspects of the software that can be configured by an institution include:</title>
          <p>The types of record that can be stored in the archive, and what metadata
fields to hold with each
The types of document file (or other data) that can be stored with each
record
The validation checks that are performed on each incoming record, to
minimise administrator effort

          <title>2. The software also has the following features:</title>
          <p>"Out of the box" Open Archives Initiative interoperability
Simple but very powerful depositing interface
Local browsing and searching features
Inter- and intra-linking potential (papers, versions, comments,
responses)
Moderation buffer for incoming deposits
Site maintenance via a WWW interface</p>
          <p>E-Mail subscription service for users</p>
          <p>It is simple to add extra functionality to an archive in the site-specific
component of the software. This means that the archive can be used by institutions,
individuals, journals or any other organisation wishing to interoperate with
Open Archive services.</p>
