Using the case of German foreign direct investments (FDI) in Hungary, this
paper is dealing with the international transfer of industrial models in
multinational corporations (MNCs). Based on qualitative research in 10 German
MNCs, that have invested in Hungary during the 1990ies, the paper criticizes
some central arguments of the national business system approach towards
corporate internationalisation, especially the notion of a rather strong and
uniform country of origin effect.</p>

          <p>Introduction1
One of the core topics of the debate on national business systems is the
question whether different national models are converging into a single model (no
matter whether this model already exists or is still emerging as a kind of "third"
model) or whether the models more or less stay as diverse as they are (or even
get more diverse). In this debate, a point frequently mentioned to prove either
convergence or divergence of national business systems is the role played by
multinational corporations (MNCs), i.e. companies that are by definition located
in more than just one national business system. Here the national business
systems literature generally assumes, that MNCs from a specific home country
interfere into the existing competitive and institutional settings of the countries in
which they invest, mainly by transferring as far as possible their production
techniques and labour practices. While this rather general assumption is
certainly not wrong, some of its more detailed arguments – especially on the unity
of the behaviour of all MNCs from a certain home country as well as on the
unity of locational and organisational conditions in the host country – seem to
be debatable.</p>
          <p>Following this objective, this paper, using the empirical case of German
foreign direct investment (FDI) in Hungary, will put emphasis on heterogeneity,
both of the transfer strategies of MNCs from a certain home country (Germany)
as well as of the locational conditions in the host country (Hungary). After a
short review of some central assumptions of the national business systems
approach to corporate internationalisation and a few theoretical remarks on the
international transfer of industrial models in MNCs, we first look, whether there
is a uniform German industrial model, all German MNCs might feel inclined to
transfer when investing abroad. Since not all elements of a national industrial
model are transferable by MNCs,2 this papers concentrates on those elements
whose transfer lie in the hands of MNCs. That is: the transfer of (1) the
production model encompassing e.g. technology, machinery (and associated skills)
production and work organisation and (2) the transfer of the model of labour
practices including specific human resource management (HRM) and industrial
relations (IR) practices. Next to that we will shift perspectives and look at
regional differences that Hungary displays as a location for foreign investments.
Having thus dealt with the institutional background we will take an empirical look
at the real transfer processes that occurred in German MNCs investing in
Hungary.

          <p>Multinational Corporations and National Business</p>
          <p>
            Systems
Dealing with MNCs from an institutionalist point of view is a rather new
phenomenon. It was not until the beginning of the 1990s that institutionalist thinking,
strongly put forward in the 1970s and 1980s, was applied to MNCs (Westney
1993) and its advent can be seen as a step against the strong dominance of
best practice approaches at that time. Best practice approaches, popularised by
management consultancies and some parts of business academia derive a
single best practice for the internationalisation of companies from their
understanding of relevant market forces such as transnational product harmonisation,
the growing importance of fixed costs and the fact that major innovations occur
in all regions of the Triad. In this view, more or less all MNCs have to apply a
value-based management style and to go for global presence while integrating
economies of scale and national responsiveness
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Bartlett/Goshal 1989, Ohmae
1990)</xref>
            . The institutionalist view strongly opposes the idea that market
constraints impose a specific best practice to the international co-ordination and
configuration of an MNC and instead stresses that the specific social and
institutional environment of an MNC is the dominant (or sole) source of normative
pressure that shapes the behaviour of an MNC. According to this view, MNCs
are by no means free to choose a single best practice solution, but their
internationalisation is shaped by their specific economic, political and
institutional home environment (e.g. Ruigrok/van Tulder 1995). However, very much
like the best practice approach, pure institutionalist explanations on corporate
internationalisation have been criticised for not being complex enough. Mueller
(1994) stressed that the behaviour of MNCs generally reflects both societal
2 One striking example is the export of the German vocational training system. While the
company can decide whether to introduce the on-the-job part of the vocational training system in
foreign subsidiaries, it has no final control whether the state in which it is investing maintains
or is willing to build up a system of vocational schools (cf. Bluhm 200
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1, Tüselmann et al.
2000</xref>
            ).
embeddedness and global best practices, with global best practices mainly
spurred by: (1) a growing convergence of product and process technology
within sectors, (2) an increasing use of benchmarking as a tool for
crosssectoral dissemination of best practices and (3) a strong exchange of
technology and management practices within MNCs. Taking that differentiation a step
further,
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref14 ref15">Dörrenbächer (2000)</xref>
            added corporate idiosyncrasies as an explanatory
factor for the internationalisation of companies. As a reason he mentions that
there is manifold empirical evidence that companies rooted in the same industry
(or segment thereof) and the same national business system show remarkable
differences in their internationalisation behaviour. According to this approach
corporate idiosyncrasies might be shaped by structural aspects (such as the
age, the size or the degree of diversification of a company) as well as by the
“specific historical development or in other words the “trajectory”
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Boyer/
Freyssenet 1995)</xref>
            of a company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the critique, that the national business system approach (alone) is
not complex enough to explain the real life variance in overall corporate
internationalisation, a second point to be explored in more detail in this paper, needs
specific attention: Many institutionalist approaches to MNCs (e.g. Hu 1992,
Sally 1994, Ruigrok/van Tulder 1995, Pauly/Reich 1997, Whitley 1999, Morgan
et al. 2000) put a strong emphasis on the impact of the country of origin (or the
home country) of the MNC. This is somewhat ignoring the fact the multinational
corporations are sui generis located in more than one national business system
with both home and (different/multiple) host country effects being at work. While
Morgan et al. (2000) explain this limitation by pragmatic reasons, Whitley (2001)
considers host country as well as foreign subsidiary influences as rather
uninteresting since, according to his opinion, these influences are in most cases
not very likely to provoke a fundamental organisational change throughout the
whole MNC: The “… discussion of how different kinds of firm from different
business systems and institutional contexts are likely to conduct their FDI in
contrasting business environments emphasizes the continuing importance of
their domestic institutions and established ways of coordinating economic
activities in their home economies” (Whitley 2001: 60-61). Here, two remarks
have to be made.
– First, the very strong emphasis on the country of origin influences seems to
be debatable, taking into consideration the strong strategic desire of the top
management of many MNCs to flee certain aspects of their country of origin
business system and/or to learn from or to experiment with aspects of other
business systems. In addition it has to be kept in mind that today the
dominant way to internationalise is external growth by (often rather large) M&amp;As
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Wortmann 2000)</xref>
            , and it is especially these large acquired subsidiaries and
their managers that are assigned a strategic role, “… not only for their own
company but for the MNC as a whole” (Hedlund 1986: 22). In this
perspective, that has received growing attention in recent years
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref21 ref3">(e.g. Goshal/Nohria
1989, Gupta/Govindarajan 1994, Birkinshaw et al. 1998, Kristensen/Zeitlin
1999, Gammelgard 2000)</xref>
            foreign subsidiaries are no longer seen as "merely
distant tools of corporate management, reacting as ganglia to impulses sent
downward through the bureaucratic nervous system" (Taggert 1998) but as
important strategic parts of MNCs, that due to their specific organisational
assets and local embeddedness might systematically contribute to the firm
specific advantages of MNCs.
– Second, taking an overall MNC perspective like Whitley does, is
systematically hiding host country influences, that might have a strong influence on the
foreign subsidiaries of the MNC in question. Such host country influences are
reported to be especially strong with regard to all human resource
management and industrial relations issues (Rosenzweig/Nohira 1994, UNCTAD
1994). Next to that, taking an overall MNC perspective is only delivering one
single picture for the MNC, despite the fact that by nature an MNC
encompasses many different views, that in many cases lead to very relevant micro
political struggles with the MNC.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all it seems that the national business system approach (despite strong
merits in the comparison of MNCs from different home countries) can only partly
explain corporate internationalisation and thus needs to be accomplished by
other approaches. One such approach, that is more opening the “black box” of
internationalisation is the emerging literature on the transfer of industrial models
in MNCs.
Ever since the first industrial revolution, the transfer either of single technologies
or production models as a whole was of specific importance for the economic
development of nations. Britain’s early start in the industrialisation around 1750
triggered a first intense phase of technology transfer to continental Europe,
Scandinavia and the USA in the late 18th Century
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(O´Brien 1986, Bruland 1991)</xref>
            .
More than hundred years later, around the first World War, Fordism in the
United States generated a new standard of productive efficiency transferred to
Europe and (to a lesser extent) to Japan (Kipping/Bjarnar 1998, Zeitlin/Herrigel
2000), superseded in the 1970s by the “global Japanisation”
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Elger/Smith
1994)</xref>
            . The study of these great historic transfer cases reveals that there is both
a multitude of (individual and collective) transfer agents as well as a great
variety of transfer channels. Thus looking at the transfer in and by MNCs (as in
this paper) is only a partial view, though not an unimportant one. With regard to
the transfer of industrial models via MNCs at least the following three analytical
levels seem to be relevant: content, results and processes.
3.1. Content
Up until now the question on what is transferred by multinationals while
investing abroad is mostly treated implicitly. One of the more explicit treatments of this
question is done by Sölvell/Zander (1998) who distinguish between the transfer
of physical, human and social capital, with the transfer of physical capital such
as standard materials, components, products and machinery being the most
mobile, human capital, embodied e.g. in the tacit knowledge of the workers,
being less mobile and social capital, embedded e.g. in social relations in (local)
business networks, being the least mobile. However, in real transfer processes,
the transfer of one type of capital is usually strongly connected to the transfer of
a second or even a third type of capital. A particularly strong connection seems
to exist between the transfer of physical and human capital. There is strong
evidence that even the transfer of the rather mobile machinery (or technology) is
burdened with many problems
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Gertler 1995)</xref>
            . These problems arise from the
fact that machinery (or technology) always consist of a kind of hardware (or
software) and knowledge, with the knowledge in most cases being localised and
tacit, taking the form of un-codified skills or capabilities
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Bruland 1991)</xref>
            . Going
beyond the transfer of a single machine or technology and looking at the
transfer of whole industrial models, similar, but much more complex problems arise.
This is easily understandable looking at what is an industrial model. According
to the definition underlying this paper an industrial model consists of (1) a
production model encompassing e.g. technology, machinery (and associates skills)
production and work organisation and (2) a model of labour practices including
specific human resource management (HRM) and industrial relations (IR)
practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Up to now only a few studies, such as the work of the Gerpisa Group on the
transfer and hybridisation of production models in the automobile industry look
at transfer issues in such a broad and interconnected way
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref6 ref8">(Boyer/Freyssenet
2000, Boyer et al. 1998, Dörr/Kessel 1999)</xref>
            . However, there is a wealth of
literature that focuses on the transfer of HRM and IR practices (such as trade
union recognition, collective pay bargaining, shop floor employee
representation, employee information, consultation and participation) throughout MNCs
(for a recent overview cf. Tüselmann et al. 2000).
3.2. Results
Almost all empirical studies that look at the cross-border transfer of industrial
models come to the conclusion that a certain amount of change is always
necessary to successfully run a factory or a business developed in one national
business system abroad. However, this does not mean that a one-to-one
transfer is excluded in reality, especially not with regard to the transfer of single
technologies or single HRM/IR aspects. Thus catching all levels of analysis, a
typology that measures changes associated with cross-border transfer
processes in our opinion has to comprise (1) one-to-one transfers, (2) simple
adaptation, where only minor changes occur, (3) real hybridisation, where the
transfer process result in something that strongly deviates both from what was
intended to transfer and from corresponding indigenous solutions, and (4) the
assertion of indigenous solutions
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(cf. too Boyer et al. 1998)</xref>
            .
3.3
          </p>
          <p>Processes
Up until now a clear process focus is somewhat underrepresented in the
literature on the transfer of industrial models. Next to the general literature on
expatriates, there are only a few studies that have looked in greater detail at the
quality and the sequencing of transfer processes, including the way or the
process how local adaptations or even hybridisations occur. Interestingly, almost all
of these studies concentrate on transfer processes undertaken by western
MNCs to their subsidiaries in Eastern Europe. For instance Rudolph (2000),
looking at transfer processes to Polish subsidiaries emanating from their
western parent companies, stresses that transfer always involves stays abroad,
either of the personnel from the model sending unit or from the model receiving
unit. Moreover, she emphasises that personal relationships are a major vehicle
in the transfer process, with the expatriate mangers playing different roles such
as “... bicultural interpreter, national defender and advocate or frontline
implementer of corporate strategy” (Paauwe/Dewe 1994:97). A detailed look into the
quality of personal relationships during transfer processes is given by Kessel/
Dörr (1998). One of the companies they looked at used a kind of a
tandemmanagement with expatriates and local managers sharing for a certain time the
both the job and the responsibility. These tandems were designed as
instruments to effectively transfer knowledge from the expatriate to the local
manager. However, it turned out, that these tandems became important
micro-political arenas for the solution of conflicts on social, cultural as well as practical
issues. This study also sheds light on the fact that transfer strategies might
change dramatically over the time. Due to many conflicts in those management
tandems, it was also detected that the original intention to more or less fully
transfer the country of origin industrial model would go too far and negatively
affect crucial questions of identity and status of the local personnel. This
resulted in a significant rewriting of the transfer strategy, with the modernised
subsidiary finally turning out as a real hybrid, which was not intended before,
but turned out to be a successful solution.</p>
          <p>After this short discussion of transfer issues, we will now turn to our
empirical case. We will first take a short look at the German Model, its main pillars and
its inherent logic. Based on our assumption that the German Model was never
as consistent as it is often presented, as well as on the thesis of an increasing
heterogeneity within the German Model since the beginning of the 1990s
(Flecker/Schulten 1999, Muller 1999), we will show that there are different
company specific interpretations of the German Model so far, that might be the
basis of what German companies wish to export when internationalising.
4.</p>
          <p>
            The German Model and its Industry/Company-Specific
Interpretation
There is little disagreement on what the main pillars of the German Model are.
According to a recent definition that draws on a wealth of former works (e.g.
Katzenstein 1980, Markovitz 1982, Streeck 1995, just to mention a few), the
German Model consists of the following main items (Flecker/Schulten 1999: 83,
points are added):
– “social market economy” (Soziale Marktwirtschaft), that is, capitalism tamed
by political macro-regulation and redistribution by the state;
– long term perspectives and a preference for productive investments on the
part of the capital;
– highly organised industrial relations combining sectoral multi-employer
bargaining and co-operative labour relations within the enterprise;
– a vocational training system that combines on-the-job-training with the
education in vocational schools and
– diversified quality production based on highly skilled workforces“
Somewhat overlapping with these items the more recent discussion has
emphasised the specific aspect of corporate governance
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(e.g. Albert 1993,
Caspar/Vitols 1997, Lallement 2001)</xref>
            . Here the German Model is usually
associated with the following three items:
– the strong role of the banks in providing long-term credit leading to patient
capital;
– the system of co-determination and;
– a style of management that is more driven by technological then by financial
aims (Jürgens et al. 2000: 59).
          </p>
          <p>According to many observers the interplay of these institutions and attitudes led
to a considerable economic and social progress in post war Germany. Industrial
conflict was widely pacified by the redistribution policy of the state (especially in
funding adjustment measures) as well as by the specific construction of the
labour relations and vocational training systems. Thus the German labour
system keeps the typically severe conflicts about wages more or less out of the
companies and at the same time allows works councils to exert some influence
on the conditions of the use of labour (via a set of information, consultation and
co-determination rights). Also the vocational training system which is partly
financed by the state and which produces large numbers of skilled workers,
reflects a compromise between capital and work since it creates both company
specific skills (via the on the job training) as well as more general transferable
skills (via the training in vocational schools). Another important effect inherent to
the German model is its favouring of “high road” strategies. Next to the “patient
capital”, it is mainly the fact that short term cutting of labour costs is both rather
difficult and costly, that directs companies much more to strategies that aim at
an increase of productivity and quality, than to strategies that aim at price
competition.</p>
          <p>
            On the shop floor, however, the general conditions of the German Model
such as the availability of skilled labour, a strong institutional backing of high
road strategies as well as rather pacified labour relations, did not in all cases
lead to a production concept other than the Fordist one, which is characterised
by centrally planned taylorized work. On the contrary, following the literature
review by Flecker/Schulten (1999: 86) as well as a review of some more recent
studies, there has always been and today still is a strong polarisation between
(1) certain industries such as the machine tool industry or the printing industry
where new concepts of work with a higher autonomy of the workers and a high
level of job sophistication exist and (2) other industries such as the automobile
and the clothing industry where low skill, Taylorist-Fordist production
organisation prevails, with the effect of a strong under-utilisation of the existing skill base
(Pries et al. 1989 cited in Flecker/Schulten 1999, Kurz 1999, Springer 2000,
Nordhause-Janz/Prekuhl 2000). Enduring differences are also reported with
regard to shop floor employee representation. Here especially small (fewer than
100 employees) and all larger firms differ a lot according to the existence or
respectively the effectiveness of shop floor employee representation. There are
both differences in the resources works councils can draw on (e.g. degree of
the exemption from the work for works council members, availability of outside
expertise, paid qualification), as well as differences in the level they are able
and “allowed” to fulfil their tasks as assigned by law

            An increase in the heterogeneisation of the German Model as a whole
occurred with the post-unification crisis in Germany and the flaring up of the
discussion about the competitiveness of Germany as a production location from

1992/3 on. Next to the growing importance of the stock markets in company
financing and a more commercial orientation of the management, the main
driving force here is the increased decentralisation of collective bargaining
(Flecker/Schulten 1999, Schroeder/Weinert 1999, Upchurch 2000).
Decentralisation of collective bargaining mainly occurs through the introduction of a
variety of opening clauses to sectoral collective agreements, allowing for company
specific differentiation. While in the case of wage issues this development does
not necessarily lead to a greater heterogeneisation between the companies,4
this is obviously the case with regard to working time issues (cutting, enlarging
and flexibility of working time). All in all, a recent study undertaken by a German
trade union related institute (WSI), comes to the conclusion that the flexibility
inherent in this decentralisation has already resulted in strong differences in the
working and wage conditions in the same industry
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Bispinck 2001)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking together the enduring differences according to the type of
production and the shop floor employee representation, as well as the more recent
tendency towards a decentralisation of collective bargaining, there is a
considerable scope of different industry or respectively company specific
interpretations of the German Model (cf. figure 1).
4 This is due to the fact that it was quite usual in successful companies to pay more than the
collective agreement proposes. In recent times, however, the negotiations on the company
level are not about additional payments but about their freezing or reduction. Whether this
leads to a greater amount of harmonisation is difficult to say, since there is also evidence
that decentralised company level bargaining in troubled firms leads to regulations below the
standards of sectoral collective agreements

          <p>Hungary as a Heterogeneous Location for Foreign Direct
Investments
Heterogeneity is not only restricted to the firm specific interpretation of the
relevant country of origin business system but refers also to regional differences in
host countries. As many other Central and East European countries, Hungary
shows strong regional inequalities with regard to different aspects that are
crucial for foreign investments. These include:
– labour market conditions (e.g. availability of a skilled workforce)
– infrastructure conditions (e.g. availability of transportation and communication
means and other economic structures such as related industries, business
services, sufficient housing conditions, cultural offers etc.) and
– industrial relations conditions (presence of trade unions, works councils,
collective bargaining structures).</p>
          <p>
            It is widely maintained that Hungary is historically displaying a double divide
with regard to many aspects just mentioned. One split is between Budapest and
the larger provincial cities on the one hand and the small and medium sized
cities as well as the countryside on the other hand. This split, inherited from
presocialist times prevailed despite the egalitarian attitude of socialist regional
policy and was aggravated due to the general decline of the agricultural sector in
the post socialist transition process (
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">Cséfalvay et al. 1997</xref>
            ). The second split is
between East Hungary and Central/West Hungary. Here especially the
Budapest region and the regions neighbouring the Austrian borders do possess a
much better infrastructure than the East. Taking a low unemployment rate as an
indicator for a work force, flexible enough to adjust to the transformation needs
during the 1990ies, again the Central region around Budapest as well as
Western Hungary are much more favourable to foreign investments than the Eastern
part of the country. Finally the heterogeneity of Hungary as an investment
location also relates to industrial relations conditions. Despite a generally low level
of regulation, the more modernized Central and Western parts of Hungary today
display a somewhat higher level of regulation, resulting from a stronger
presence of trade unions and a more widespread existence of works councils (Toth
1999, Kisgyörgy/Vámos 2001). Probably more important with regard to the
regional heterogeneity of Hungary as an investment location are the results
from the extremely individualized and decentralised Hungarian wage
determination system (Neumann 2000). Here the local labour market performance is
playing a decisive role, with the labour markets in Central and West Hungary
being rather tight (and wages rather high) as a result of a strong concentration
of foreign direct investments in those regions.5

          <p>The Transfer of the German Industrial Model to Hungary
via FDI: Empirical Results
In line with the general trend, also German FDI have concentrated in the more
developed Central and Western region of Hungary. Taken as a whole Hungary
today is the seventh most attractive host country for German investments and
Germany is the single largest foreign investor in Hungary. German investments
in Hungary concentrate on a few industries such as electronics, automotive,
food beverage &amp; tobacco, machinery and metal products. These five industries
account for approx. 60 percent of all German investments in Hungary (in terms
of foreign employment). Compared to the overall structure of German FDI,
Hungary is of specific importance for labour intensive industries such as apparel
and footwear production.</p>
          <p>Out of a total sample of about 150 German investments in Hungary we
have selected 10 cases (cf. Table 1), for a closer examination of transfer
issues.6 These 10 cases represent to a large extend the main structural
characteristics of the total sample (Dörrenbächer et al. 2000b).7
5 In 1999 unemployment was below 6 percent in Central (Country of Pest) and parts of
Western Hungary (Countries of Zala, Vas, Györ-Moson-Sopron) compared to 12 or more percent
in all eastern and most southern parts of the countries (OECD 2000: 113)
6 These cases are based on interviews in the German headquarters and/or their Hungarian
subsidiary, that the author has conducted during October 2000 and March 2001. Most
interviews were conducted together with Michael Wortmann. To make the cases anonymous was
not required by our interview partners. The existing provisional case studies will be
integrated into final case studies by different members of the project team (cf. footnote 1).
7 Almost identical with the overall picture about 70% of the investors in the sample are small
and medium-sized companies; for about half of them the Hungarian subsidiary is the only
foreign production location. Again very close to the overall trend, three quarters of the cases
are acquisitions. Furthermore the sample comprises investments in all those industries,
where the amount of German investment is above their world-wide average (with the notable
exception of the food/beverage/tobacco industry). Only concerning the location of the
investments the sample shows a slight weakness since investments in the developed Central
and Western region of Hungary are slightly underrepresented. Finally, next to large and
small Hungarian subsidiaries, the sample comprises strong export-oriented subsidiaries,
subsidiaries that mainly produce for the local market, as well as subsidiaries with a split
market orientation.

          <p>Transfer Intentions, Forms and Results
One of the most striking common features among the 10 cases is the fact that
almost all German MNCs intended a one-to-one transfer of all those aspects of
their industrial model that are related to technology, machinery, production and
work organisation (i.e. the production model). Usually the transfer of those
aspects was highly interconnected. Only in one rather exceptional case, where
the production technology as such was very outdated, the transfer only aimed at
the integration of a few machines and tools into an already existing production
site in Hungary (Wamsler-SVT).8</p>
          <p>The transfer itself took several forms. In four of the cases studied, an
existing plant or production line was built down in Germany, shipped to Hungary and
built up there (Balluff, FHP, März, Kübler). Of the same type, but somewhat
different was the Siemens case. Here a production line for switching equipment
was build down at the Austrian switching plant of Siemens in Vienna and the
whole transfer to Hungary was managed by the Austrian subsidiary. In three
other cases (Salamander, Heidelberger Zement, Festo) the transfer occurred as
a strong modernisation and reorganisation of an existing production. Finally,
there was one case, where the investor, based on knowledge gained in
Germany over many decades, built up a totally new, state-of-the-art factory in
Hungary (Nordenia).</p>
          <p>Unlike the well reported flagship case of German investments in Hungary,
the Audi-Györ case, where innovations for the whole Audi Group were clearly
intended (Kessel/Dörr 1998:2), our case studies revealed only weak intentions
to innovate with the investments in Hungary. There is only one case where the
investment was somewhat influenced by the possibility to get access to a new
product not produced before in the MNC (Festo) and another case where the
Hungarian subsidiary over the years gained some, however rather minor R&amp;D
tasks for the whole MNC (Balluff). Process innovations were not at all intended
in our cases. Companies that used to apply a Fordist production (based on
taylorised work) in their (former) German production (such as Salamander or FHP)
did so in Hungary, too, and companies that followed more modern production
strategies in Germany such as flexible specialisation (incl. group work), did so in
Hungary, too (e.g. Nordenia, Balluff, Festo). Interestingly, especially the latter
companies can hardly be seen as purely transferring a German solution given
the many explicitly Japanese aspects such as Kanban or Kaizen, they have
incorporated (usually with the help of Japanese consultants) in their
firmspecific model.
8 Wamsler-SVT is a rather exceptional case, since the Hungarian subsidiary (SVT) has taken
over its former minority shareholder (Wamsler) in November 2000.</p>
          <p>These rather conservative ideas and aims associated with the transfer of
the production model (i.e. technology, machinery, production and work
organisation) certainly reflect the large socio-economic gap between Germany and
Hungary as well as the conviction of some of our interview partners to run a
state-of-the-art, world class, factory. However, with regard to a few companies,
this tendency also reflects a strategy of “security first”, with transferring the
firmspecific production model one-to-one being “... the best way to control any kind
of catastrophe” (owner/manager of a German MNC). According to this interview
partner these “catastrophes” not only relate to transfer problems as such, but
also include labour disputes in Germany.</p>
          <p>This refers to the question of transferring the German Model of labour
practices (HRM and IR practices). Despite the fact that many of our interview
partners (from the management side) initially maintained that they had transferred
the German Model of HRM and IR practices, a closer examination showed a
rather different result. Thus, it turned out that in many cases the sheer existence
of a works council at the Hungarian affiliate and the strong desire of the
management to transfer the German wage classification scheme were treated as
sufficient indicators for the German Model having been transferred. Indeed,
almost all companies in our sample aimed at such a transfer of the German
wage classification scheme to harmonise wage discrepancies within (and in
some cases between) individual wage groups in their Hungarian affiliates9. And
in nine out of the ten cases a works council exists at the Hungarian subsidiary.
However, only in two cases these works councils were considered strong
enough to really be a bargaining partner for the management. In all other cases
the works council was either installed with the help of the management, more or
less ignored, or only used to channel information into the workforce. In about
half of our cases unions were completely absent at the Hungarian subsidiaries
and sectoral collective bargaining did not occur at all. Collective bargaining at
the company level was reported for half of the companies. However, in most
cases these were rather informal talks on wages and not real bargaining
processes. At the other half of the companies, wages and working conditions were
only subject of individual negotiations between each employee and the
management.</p>
          <p>
            Especially the last two points mentioned imply a strong depart from the
German Model of industrial relations. This depart is even stronger if we look at
some HRM practices: Trial and error employee selection, the use of leased
workers, frequent overtime or work on weekends are in almost all cases simply
management prerogatives, that are excessively used by some companies. All in
all there is a general tendency to not or only very selectively transfer the
Ger9 These are due to historical legacies and the different regional as well as historical labour
market conditions in Hungary.
man Model of HRM and IR practices. This holds true despite the fact that there
are considerable differences among the cases. Confirming the results of
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Bluhm
(2001)</xref>
            , large MNCs such as Siemens or Heidelberger Zement are following the
German path of labour relations in Hungary much more strictly than many small
German investors.10 This is also half true for those German companies, that
apply a high skill Post-Fordist production systems: While these companies relay
much more on skilled workers and invest a lot in training, this does not
automatically mean, that they also transfer their German IR practices to their
Hungarian subsidiary.
          </p>
          <p>Taken together German investors in Hungary seem to follow mixed
intentions with regard to their transfer policy. While German investors usually aim at
a one-to-one transfer of their firm specific production model11 (which is not
necessarily a German or a pure German one), they only rather selectively transfer
the German Model of labour practices. And they do so, even taking into account
the growing heterogeneity of HRM and IR practices in Germany. Thus all
Hungarian affiliates in our case studies turned out to be hybrids, with a rather strong
but not exclusive German influence in technology, production and work
organisation and a rather strong Hungarian influence in HRM and IR practices.
6.2.</p>
          <p>Transfer Process
Looking at the transfer process, other differences become apparent. Especially
large firms with many (more or less comparable) subsidiaries all over the world
(such as Siemens or Heidelberger Zement) followed a very structured approach
towards the whole transfer process. Guided by a clear (sometimes codified)
transfer blueprint (including a strict time frame), the transfer process itself was
managed by an experienced multifunctional and multicultural team. Compared
to that, the transfer process at many of the smaller companies was much less
structured and relied more on the individual capacity of single expatriate
managers from the German investor, who in many cases were intrinsically motivated
either by a career step associated with the new task or because they are of
Hungarian descent or have other personal relationships to Hungary. Sometimes
managers from third companies were hired to carry out the transfer and to run
the Hungarian affiliate later-on.</p>
          <p>
            While there was a common complaint, that there is a strong lack of local
management personnel, that complies with the expectations of the German
10 However, whether this is a question of size, as argued by
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Bluhm (2001)</xref>
            and/or a question
of market orientation needs to be explored in greater detail.
11 With regard to a few acquisitions, a one-to-one transfer was not feasible, due to existing
production means.
investors (i.e. speaking German and having state-of-the-art management and/or
technical know how), notably different strategies were followed with regard to
local management personnel: Despite the skill gap, a few companies assigned
the local management a core role from the outset (e.g. Balluff, Heidelberger
Zement). Most investors, however, first trained local management personnel
(sometimes in a very structured way, e.g. at Siemens), that later took over the
tasks of the expatriate managers leaving. Finally, there were also a few cases
where the expatriates were and still are very dominant (e.g. Nordenia, FHP).
          </p>
          <p>As a general rule, there was no or only weak training to prepare the
expatriates for their task in Hungary. Compared to that, the Hungarian management as
well as the Hungarian production workers got rather intensive training (whether
this was sufficient or not, is another question). Usually these efforts concentrate
on an on-the-job training at the German headquarter and/or at related factories
in the MNC. In many cases, these factories were not necessarily located in
Germany. E.g. in the Siemens case, all training took place in Austria. At
Nordenia, machine workers from Hungary were sent to different affiliates all over the
world, depending on where a similar machine to the one in question in Hungary
had recently been installed. Training efforts also included on-the-job-training in
the Hungarian subsidiary carried out by personnel from the headquarters or
from other subsidiaries of the MNC, temporarily transferred to the Hungarian
plant. Finally, especially machine suppliers and to a somewhat lesser extent
consulting firms played an important role in transferring skills and knowledge to
Hungary. Both were not necessarily of German origin, too.</p>
          <p>Almost all companies reported frequent emergency visits of headquarter
personnel (managers, technicians) at the beginning of their investments, and
later a decreasing or increasing intensity of headquarters presence at the
Hungarian subsidiary, depending on the actual intensity of the transfer process, that
is usually carried out in a sequence of single transfer steps (or projects). This
sheds light on the fact that beyond a necessary minimum transfer, the floor is
open for different degrees regarding the “completeness” of the transfer. For
one, it is rather obvious that all companies who had (März) or still have more
than one factory of the same type in Hungary (Salamander, Heidelberger
Zement) prefer to focus most of their transfer and investment efforts on one of
their Hungarian affiliates. Two, in some of our cases it was reported that the
very favourable cost structure of Hungary till 1996/1997 led to incomplete
transfers with regard to the level of efficiency and quality. With the worsening of
the international cost position of Hungary (no adequate devaluation of the Forint
compared to inflation for the last three years), especially companies, that aim at
low cost export production (such as Salamander or FHP, that are working under
the OPT regime) come under severe pressure, that will eventually either lead to
a "completion" of the transfer process, or to a relocation of the production out of
Hungary.
Unlike orthodox institutionalist thinking our empirical cases reveal that - keeping
both home and host country stable - there is still a lot of heterogeneity in
corporate internationalisation. Companies do vary with regard to what aspects
of their industrial model they transfer abroad, and to what extend these
transfers occur. In our empirical cases all companies aimed at a one-to-one-transfer
of their firm specific production model, and thus mirrored the heterogeneity
inherent in the German Model (e.g. with regard to the dichotomy of low skill,
Fordist type and high skill Post-Fordist type of production). Big differences
however occurred concerning the export of their respective labour practices. Here it
turned out that only the rather large German MNCs and those (smaller) German
MNC, that assigned their Hungarian subsidiary a strategic role for the future of
the whole MNC, showed a tendency to strongly reproduce their home country
behaviour abroad (although the reproduction was far from being complete).</p>
          <p>Furthermore some of our cases raise serious doubts about the question
whether all German MNCs transfer something like a German Model. Following
the long and intense debate about lean production, Kanban and the like, some
of the German firms studied, can hardly be seen as maintaining a pure German
industrial model, since many aspects thereof (with the notable exception of IR
practices) looked rather Japanese. Thus, there is already a hybridisation at the
source of the transfer. In addition, in some cases both the transfer of physical
assets as well as the transfer of knowledge did (sometime very systematically)
involve other than German units of the MNC in question, in some cases even
(foreign) organisations outside the MNC (such as machine suppliers or
consultancies undertaking training measures).</p>
          <p>Finally there was also a striking heterogeneity in the quality of the transfer
process, with the large MNCs following a much more structured approach than
most of the small and medium sized MNCs. Despite the fact that in none of the
ten cases examined, the transfer really failed, it is obvious that in those cases
where the transfer process was rather chaotic and incomplete a higher risk for a
further relocation exists, with severe drawbacks for the Hungarian subsidiary
guaranteed and problems for the whole MNC (especially for the smaller ones)
being rather likely.
