        <p>In a series of three studies, we investigated the validity of implicit theories that the German public holds regarding Muslims. German participants expected Muslims to be more aggressive than Christians, and therefore be more supportive of terrorism than Christians. Furthermore, Muslims were assumed to be more intrinsically religious and to hold a stronger identity with their religion than Christians (Study 1). However, self-assessment surveys of Muslims and Christians in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS: ex-Soviet Union) revealed that Muslims were not more aggressive, more intrinsically religious, or more supportive of terrorism than Christians. In contrast, Muslims reported a stronger religious identification than Christians (Study 2). Correspondingly, threat to religious identity was found to affect only Muslims', but not Christians', attitudes toward terrorism conducted by outgroup perpetrators. In contrast to Germans' implicit theories regarding Muslims, it was the importance of religious identity and not increased aggression potential that mediated this effect (Study 3).</p>

        Over the past 5 years, prolific and devastating
t e r r o r i s t a t t a c k s c o n d u c t e d b y I s l a m i c
fundamentalists in America (mostly notably
the World Trade Center attack of September
11, 2001), the European Union
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(e.g. the train
bombing in Madrid on March 11, 2004; the
London underground attack in July, 2005)</xref>
        , Asia
(e.g. the Bali bombings of October 12, 2002)
and the Middle East (e.g. almost daily attacks
and suicide bombings in Iraq and Israel) against
Western interests and rival Islamic groups
have dramatically changed the global political
climate and are likely to have heavily impacted
on the general perception that Westerners hold
regarding Muslims. As a consequence of these
frequent and recent terrorist attacks conducted
by Islamic fundamentalists, in addition to other
factors such as frequent media reports on
terrorist attacks or political justifications of
Western counterterrorist activity (e.g. ‘War on terror’
in Afghanistan and Iraq; ‘Operation Enduring
Freedom’), specific implicit theories and
stereotypes of ‘how Muslims really are’ relative to
Christians may have emerged within western
Christian societies. First of all, Muslims might
be expected to be more intrinsically religious
than Christians because many fundamentalists
have died (and are willing to sacrifice
themselves) as suicide bombers in the name of their
religion. Second, religious identity might be
more important to Muslims than Christians,
because many Muslim nations do not distinguish
between church and state and thus try to prevent
secularization. Third, because of frequent suicide
bombings in Israel and Iraq, the broadcast
executions of Americans and hostages of other
nationalities in Iraq, and public proclamations by
Muslim terrorist leaders (e.g. Osama Bin Laden)
to fight the enemies of ‘the true faith’, Christians
might expect Muslims to be extraordinarily
aggressive. Fourth, and finally, because most of
the recent spate of terrorist attacks were
conducted by Islamic extremists, and due to other
powerful media images such as those showing
Muslims celebrating the attacks on the World
Trade Center, Muslims might be expected to
be more supportive of terrorism as a justified
political instrument than Christians.1
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is it important to know more about
Westerners’ implicit theories of Muslims?
Implicit theories are construction frameworks
that people use in everyday life to interpret and
evaluate their social world
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref15 ref7">(Dweck, Chiu, &amp;
Hong, 1995; Hong, Levy, &amp; Chiu, 2001)</xref>
        , guide
social judgments, and develop social actions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref14 ref15">(Levy, 1999; Levy, Plaks, Hong, Chiu, &amp; Dweck,
2001)</xref>
        . If members of Western Christian societies
really subscribe to the above-mentioned implicit
theories on Muslims, it could have far ranging
and serious consequences for the understanding
of and social interaction with the Islamic world.
An assumption by Christians that Muslims are
extraordinarily aggressive or inclined towards
terrorism could be expected to lead to a different
attitude toward Muslims than an assumption that
they are placid people who generally condemn
terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>Because religiously motivated terrorism is
one of the biggest social challenges facing
modern Western societies at the present time,
in this study we primarily focused on expected
and actual attitudes of Muslims and Christians
toward terrorism, as well as the underlying
psychological mechanisms propelling these
perceptions and attitudes. We report on three studies
that investigated: Germans’ implicit theories
on Muslims and Christians (Study 1); tested
their validity with self-assessment surveys of
Muslims and Christians in the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS: ex-Soviet Union)
(Study 2); and finally pointed out the specific
role of religious identity in attitudes toward
terrorism as a political instrument (Study 3).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>Study 1</title>
      <p>
        Germans in Munich, Bavaria—a predominantly
Catholic and arguably the most conservative
of German states—were asked about their
perceptions of Christians and Muslims living
in the CIS (which contains countries like
Azerbaijan, whose population is 95% Muslim
and which is located near Iran) in terms of
their religiousness, importance of religious
identity, aggression potential, and attitudes
toward terrorism. Compared to Christians, we
assumed that Germans expected Muslims to be:
(a) more intrinsically religious; (b) more strongly
religiously identified; (c) more aggressive; and
(d) more accepting of terrorism. We expected
these perceptions to be independent of whether
German participants were of a Christian
denomination or not. If our assumption was
correct, then the expected effects should not be
likely due to processes of social identity related
to religious affiliation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Tajfel, 1982)</xref>
        . In other
words, expected effects should not be mainly
based on German Christians stereotyping of
Muslims because they consider the latter to be
a religious outgroup.

LudwigsMaximilians-University Munich campus and
asked whether they would be willing to
participate in a study dealing with attitudes towards
different religions. If they agreed, they were led
to an experimental lab at the nearby University
campus and read the following synopsis:
Religion is an important part of many societies and
many peoples’ daily life. Therefore, it is important to
learn as much as possible about religion in different
cultures. In the present study, we are interested in
your perception of Muslims (Christians) in the CIS
(ex-Soviet Union).</p>
          <p>
            Subsequently, participants estimated Muslims’
(Christians’) aggression potential using a German
translation of an aggression questionnaire by
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Buss and Perry (1992)</xref>
            . This translation was
modified from a first-person to a third-person
perspective (α = .93). Next (and in keeping
with single-item measurement of attitudes),
participants were asked on a scale from 0 (not at all )
to 10 (extremely) to what extent they supposed
that Muslims (Christians) condone terrorism as a
justified political instrument. Lastly, participants
reported to what extent they assumed that religious
identity is important to Muslims (Christians)
(0 = not at all important; 10 = extremely important).
The distinction between religiosity and religious
identity is useful, because religiosity concerns
the degree of a person’s religious participation
whereas, by contrast, religious identity concerns
the affiliation of a person with a certain religious
group
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(see Regnerus, 2003, who also measured
importance of religious identity using a single
item)</xref>
            . Finally, participants were asked to assess
Muslims’ (Christians’) degree of intrinsic
religiosity (α = .61) in a German translation

            .
Because intrinsic religiosity is the measure for
‘real’ and lived religiosity
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref4 ref9">(Allport &amp; Ross,
1967; Bergin, 1991; Hill &amp; Pargament, 2003)</xref>
            ,
we only used intrinsic religiosity as a measure of
religiosity (as opposed to extrinsic religiosity).
Finally, participants indicated in open-ended
question format their own religious denomination,
were informed about the actual aim of the
investigation, and were dismissed.

        <title>Results and Discussion</title>
        <p>A 2 × 2 × 4 factorial multivariate analysis of
variance (MANOVA) with ‘religion of target group’
(Muslims vs. Christians) and ‘denomination
of participants’ (Christian vs. none) as
betweenparticipant factors, and intrinsic religiosity,
importance of religious identity, aggression
potential and attitudes toward terrorism as
dependent variables, revealed a significant
main effect for ‘religion of target group’
(multivariate F(4, 112) = 9.25, p &lt; .001, η2 = .25). All
means and standard deviations are reported
in Table 1. Univariate follow-up analyses revealed
that Muslims (compared to Christians) were
expected to be more intrinsically religious (F(1,
115) = 20.29, p &lt; .001, η2 = .15), to have a greater
religious identification (F(1, 115) = 8.35, p &lt; .01,
η2 = .07), to be more aggressive (F(1, 115) = 5.69,
p = .02, η2 = .05), and to be more supportive of
terrorism as a justified political instrument
(F(1, 115) = 15.66, p &lt; .001, η2 = .12). No
significant interaction was observed between
‘religion of target group’ and ‘denomination of
participants’ (multivariate F(4, 112) = 0.60,
p &gt; .66, η2 = .02), indicating that the effects
reported above were probably not mainly due
to processes of social categorization by (or
due to issues of social identity of) German
Christians (compared to non-Christian German</p>

          Mediational analysis A mediational analysis
that followed
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref>
          mediation criteria was conducted in order to
investigate whether Muslims were expected to be
more accepting of terrorism because they were
assumed to be extraordinarily: (a) aggressive;
(b) intrinsically religious; or (c) strongly
identified with their religion. Preliminary regression
analyses revealed that only the assumed
aggression potential was a potential mediator for
different expectations about Christians’ and
Muslims’ attitudes toward terrorism. First of
all, a regression analysis with the experimental
condition ‘religion of target group’ as a predictor
variable and the dependent variable ‘attitudes
toward terrorism’ as a criterion variable revealed
a significant regression weight (β = –.44; t(117)
= –5.22, p &lt; .001). Second, a regression analysis
with ‘religion of target group’ as a predictor
and the assumed mediator ‘expected aggression
potential’ as a criterion variable also revealed a
significant regression weight (β = –.33; t(117)
= –3.81, p &lt; .001). Third, a regression analysis
with the assumed mediator ‘expected aggression
potential’ as a predictor and the dependent
variable ‘attitudes toward terrorism’ as a criterion
variable revealed a significant regression
weight (β = .66; t(117) = 9.44, p &lt; .001). Finally,
a regression analysis with the predictors
‘religion of target group’ and ‘expected aggression
potential’ that simultaneously predicted the
criterion ‘attitudes toward terrorism’ revealed
a significant regression equation (R 2 = .49;
F(2, 116) = 54.55, p &lt; .001). Both the expected
aggression potential (β = .58; t(117) = 8.16,
p &lt; .001) and ‘religion of target group’ (β = –.24;
t(117) = –3.44, p &lt; .01) reached a significant
regression weight. A Sobel Test revealed that
the indirect effect of the independent variable
(religion of target group) on the dependent
variable (attitudes toward terrorism) via the
mediator (expected aggression potential) was
significantly different from zero (Z = –3.44,
p &lt; .001). Hence, the unmediated β-coefficient
for religion of target group on attitudes toward
terrorism significantly decreased when the
expected aggression potential was controlled
for. Thus, the expected aggression potential
mediated the effect of religion of target group
on attitudes toward terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>In sum, Study 1 confirmed our expectations:
German participants assumed Muslims to be
more religious, more aggressive, more strongly
identified with their religion, and more accepting
of terrorism than Christians. Furthermore, a
mediational analysis revealed that participants
expected Muslims to be more accepting of
terrorism because they were expected to be more
aggressive than Christians. By contrast, intrinsic
religiosity and importance of religious identity
were not significant mediators. In the next step,
we investigated whether Muslims are indeed
more intrinsically religious, more strongly
identified with their religion, more aggressive,
and more supportive of terrorism than Christians
by directly surveying Christians and Muslims via
self-assessment.</p>

importance of religious identity, aggression,

type of religion (multivariate F(4, 46) = 2.64,
p &lt; .05, η2 = .19). All means and standard
deviations are reported in Table 1. Univariate
follow-up analyses revealed that religious
identity was more important to Muslims than
Christians (F(1, 49) = 4.51, p &lt; .05, η2 = .08).
In contrast, no differences between religious

(F(1, 49) = 3.10, p = .09, η2 = .06).</p>
        <p>Study 2 revealed that three of four implicit
theories that Germans hold regarding Muslims
(as compared to Christians) were without basis:
Muslims did not report that they were more
intrinsically religious, more aggressive, or more
supportive of terrorism than Christians.
However, Muslims reported that their religious
identity is more important to them than did
Christians. This result might have important
implications for Muslims’ and Christians’
attitudes toward terrorism as a political instrument:
if a terrorist attack is conducted by a Christian
perpetrator, then Muslims might experience
strong religious identification because they were
threatened by a perpetrator with a different
(Christian) religious affiliation. However, if a
terrorist attack is conducted by a Muslim
perpetrator, then Muslims’ religious identification
might be less pronounced because the religious
affiliation of the perpetrator matches with their
own religious affiliation. In contrast, because
religious identification is less important for
Christians than it is for Muslims, Christians’
religious identification might be less affected
by the denomination or religious affiliation
of a terrorist. As a consequence, Muslims
(because of the stronger religious identification)
might regard terrorism as less justified if the
perpetrators were Christians compared to if they
were Muslims, whereas Christians’ perceptions
of a terrorist attack (because of the less
pronounced religious identification) might be less
affected by the religion of the perpetrator. Study 3
was designed to test this line of thought.</p>

to what extent they were (a) religious, (b)

importance of religious identity, Muslims were
expected to regard terrorism as less justified

were Muslims. In contrast, Christians were not
expected to be sensitive to the religious source

of religious identity—and not by a greater
aggression potential of Muslims compared to
Christians—as was suggested by the results

increased over the last few years, and has become
one of the most challenging social problems facing

aggression on individuals’ cognitions and emotions.
In order to prevent biasing your assessments, we
have not named the location or date of the following
description of a disastrous terrorist attack; needless
to say, it was a tragic example of Muslim (Christian)
aggression that was conducted in a major city in
the CIS some months ago by Muslim (Christian)
terrorists. Fourteen people lost their lives and
many others were seriously injured. People in that
city are still shocked and are desperately trying to
reclaim a sense of normality in their lives. A letter
from the terrorists revealed that Muslim (Christian)
extremists, who approved of using force to further
their religious agenda, were responsible for that
terrorist attack.
Next, participants filled out the same scales and
items as in the previous two studies: intrinsic
religiosity (α = .66), importance of religious identity,
aggression potential (α = .86), and attitude to
the terrorist attack. Finally, participants indicated
their religious denomination, were debriefed,
informed about the aim of the investigation, and
dismissed. Please note that all participants were
informed that the described terrorist attack was
only fictitious and not real. It was also ensured
that no participant left the study with negative
emotions or mindsets.</p>

        <p>Mediational analyses Preliminary analyses
revealed that only ‘importance of religious
identity’ could be a potential mediator of the
interaction effect of ‘religion of terrorists’
and ‘religion of participant’ on ‘justification
of terrorism’. The aggression potential and
degree of intrinsic religiosity were not potential
mediators. Because the simple effects analysis
revealed that only Muslims’ attitudes toward
terrorism were affected by information about
the religious denomination of the terrorists,
the following analyses for religious identity as
a potential mediator were conducted only for
Muslims.</p>
        <p>A regression analysis with the predictor
‘religion of terrorists’ and the criteria
‘justification of terrorist attack’ revealed a significant
We found that Germans in Munich, Bavaria,
expected Muslims to be more intrinsically religious,
more aggressive, more strongly identified with
their religion, and more supportive of terrorism
than Christians, and that assumed/expected positive
attitudes toward terrorism were mediated by an
expected higher aggression potential of Muslims
(Study 1). However, direct surveys of Muslims
and Christians in the CIS showed that these
religious groups only differed with regard to the
importance of their religious identity: Muslims
reported a stronger identification with their
religion than did Christians (Study 2). From this
result, we concluded that Muslims’ (relative to
Christians’) religious identity is more strongly
affected by the religion of a terrorist perpetrator,
which could possibly result in different attitudes
toward terrorism (Study 3). As expected, Muslims
assessed a terrorist attack to be less justified if
it was conducted by Christian extremists than if it
was conducted by Muslim extremists. In contrast,
Christians’ acceptance of a terrorist attack did
not depend on whether the perpetrators were
Christian or Muslim. Furthermore, this
difference between Muslims and Christians was
mediated by differences related to importance
of religious identity: when importance of
religious identity and the religion of perpetrators
(Muslim or Christian) were considered together,
only the importance of religious identity affected
Muslims’ attitudes toward terrorism. Note that
this result clearly contradicted the Germans’
implicit theory that Muslims favor terrorism
because they are extraordinarily aggressive.</p>
        <p>Muslims’ attitudes towards terrorism did not
depend on an increased aggression potential,
but on their own religious identity. Please also
note that increased religious identification of
Muslims did not lead to more justification of
Muslim aggression, but to lowered justification
of Christian aggression. This clearly contradicts
implicit theories Westerners hold about Muslims
(see Study 1).</p>

      <sec id="sec-4-3">
        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>
          There were some limitations to our research that
must be borne in mind. First of all, our samples
were relatively small and thus not likely to be
representative of Christians and Muslims
elsewhere, nor of perceptions held by Christians and
nonreligious individuals elsewhere. Future
research should employ larger samples in order
to improve our ability to generalize our present
findings. Second, although recent research
revealed that Muslim youth in the USA are
significantly more religious than comparable
nonMuslim youth in the USA
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Ahmed, 2004)</xref>
          , there
is doubt as to whether increased importance of
religious identity is unique to Islam: other research
has also shown that the centrality of religious
beliefs in one’s life is a component of intrinsic
religiosity and religious fundamentalism, and
neither of these two constructs are particularly
associated with a specific religious content or
different religious denomination. For example,
Hunsberger, Owusu, and Duck (1999) have
shown that the construct of religious
fundamentalism operates similarly across religious and
cultural contexts. Specifically, for both Ghanaian
Muslims and Christians as well as for Canadian
Christians, religious fundamentalism was
positively correlated with right-wing authoritarianism
and positively associated with negative attitudes
toward homosexuals
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(see also Hunsberger, 1996)</xref>
          .
In addition,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Burris and Jackson (2000)</xref>
          have
demonstrated that, for a sample of Christians,
intrinsic religious orientation was strongly
correlated with religious group identification.
Intrinsically religious participants, whose
religious self-perceptions concerning religious
group membership were threatened, showed
increased religious self-stereotyping. For these
reasons, it is important to acknowledge that
the results of the present studies—that illustrate
stronger religious identification among Muslim
than among Christian participants—may be
in part due to the context and/or small samples
from which the participants were recruited.
Hence, future research should further investigate
whether different religious affiliations are
associated with differences in religious identification
by employing larger samples and different
cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, Study 1 revealed that German
participants perceived Muslims more negatively than
they did Christians. This might still be due to
evaluative ingroup/outgroup distinctions,
because Muslims are considered an outgroup by
both German unaffiliated persons and German
Christians. Given that unfavorable attitudes
toward religious outgroups are quite prevalent
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref13">(Jackson &amp; Hunsberger, 1999)</xref>
          , it seems possible
that social identity processes may still have been
relevant to both groups. Fourth and finally, with
regard to the findings of Study 3, that Muslims
viewed a terrorist attack as less justified if the
perpetrators were Christian rather than Muslim,
we want to note the potential relevance of
historical and current inequalities between some
countries that are predominantly Christian
versus Muslim in shaping Muslims’ perceptions
of the justifiability of terrorist attacks. Hence, it
would be a fruitful endeavor for future research
to control potential (perceived) historical
differences between Muslim and Christian countries,
and their effect on perceived justifiability of
aggressive acts.

        <title>Theoretical and practical implications</title>
        <p>
          Because implicit theories are used to interpret
and evaluate the social world
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(e.g. Hong et al.,
2001)</xref>
          , guide social judgments, and inform social
actions
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref14 ref15">(e.g. Levy, 1999; Levy et al., 2001)</xref>
          , these
results might have important implications for
understanding and social interaction between
the Islamic and Western Christian world: the
Western Christian world assumes Muslims to be
more aggressive than Christians, and therefore to
be more supportive of terrorism than Christians.
As a consequence, Muslims might be regarded
as potential aggressors threatening the Western
world, which would lead to oppressive actions
and preventive decisions such as military
interventions
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref22">(e.g. the war in Iraq, 2003, or the war in
Afghanistan, 2001)</xref>
          , economic embargoes (e.g.
Iraq, 1991 to 2003) or interdictions of Islamic
symbols (e.g. the interdiction of head scarves
of Muslim women in German schools).
Consequently, Muslims interpret such actions by the
Western Christian sphere to be a threat to their
religious identity, which results in a different
attitude toward terrorism. This, in turn, confirms
implicit opinions and stereotypes that Western
people hold regarding Muslims, and results in
further encroachments and restrictive actions
against Muslims and Islamic countries. This
line of thought illustrates how (unjustified)
implicit theories about Muslims could lead to a
selffulfilling prophecy
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref18">(e.g. Madon, Jussim &amp; Eccles,
1997; Rosenthal &amp; Jacobson, 1968)</xref>
          , maintaining
or even intensifying a vicious circle. In order to
break through this circle, the Western world
should avoid threatening Muslims’ religious
identity. For instance, it should be communicated
that military interventions to find terrorists (e.g.
the Afghanistan war) are not meant to impair
Muslims’ religious or cultural identity. To
conclude, the present results suggest that it is
important for Western Christian society to critically
question its own stereotypic beliefs about Muslims
in order to promote a better understanding and
harmony between cultures.

      <title>Note</title>
      <p>1. Please note also that 15–20 years ago, Christians
in Ireland were using terrorism on a frequent</p>
      <p>muslims and terrorism
basis as a political instrument. We investigated
only perceptions and stereotypes of religious
groups, and do not propose that attitudes toward
terrorism are indeed specific to a
certain religion or religious orientation.
