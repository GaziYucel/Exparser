        <p>This study examined whether differences in the endorsement of the 'Protestant Work Ethic' (PWE) are related to motivation losses in group work. Three factors were derived from male student scores on the Mirels-Garrett Protestant Work Ethic Scale, Ho's Australian Work Ethic Scale and a scale designed to assess preferences for reward distributions: instrumental value of work, ethical value of work and normative value of equity. The study assessed motivation loss in two situations; one designed to promote free-rider effects and another designed to promote sucker effects. Results showed that the sucker effect was moderated by all three factors but in qualitatively different ways whereas the free rider effect was not strongly moderated by any of the PWE factors.</p>

        Many important tasks cannot be completed by
single individuals, but can only be accomplished
by groups. Many tasks in organizations require
members of teams to pool their individual
contributions in order to reach the group goal
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(e.g.
Antoni, 1994)</xref>
        . However, teamwork does not
always work out as intended. In some instances,
the group product is satisfying; in other instances,
the group is far from achieving their productive
potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        The failure of groups to realize their
potential group productivity has been thoroughly
investigated and is a well established finding.
Decreased productivity can be the result of
coordination losses, but it is also a result of effort
reduction stemming from motivation losses
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27 ref37">(Latane, Williams, &amp; Harkins, 1979; Steiner,
1972)</xref>
        . One proposed reason for motivation losses
is that individuals might realize that their
contribution cannot be identified and thus evaluated
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Harkins &amp; Jackson, 1985)</xref>
        . Furthermore, group
members may perceive their contributions as
dispensable and hence reduce their effort while
free-riding on the contributions of the others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref25">(Kerr &amp; Bruun, 1983)</xref>
        . These explanations assume
that the basic motivation of each individual
cannot be intrinsic to working per se or to
maximize the group’s utility. It is rather assumed that
the basic motivation of each individual consists in
maximizing individual utility, hence maximizing
the individual input–output ratio, an assumption
underlying neoclassical economics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Group work can be viewed as a social dilemma
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref25">(Kerr, 1983)</xref>
        inasmuch as the strategy ‘not to
contribute to the group product’ dominates the
strategy ‘to contribute’, no matter what the other
group members are doing. However if no one
contributes, the collective is worse off as the
group does not produce. In other words, group
members have an incentive to defect as long as
their contributions are additive and the
members’ main aim is to achieve a maximal individual
outcome. But pursuing that strategy is not
conducive to group productivity, and hence in
conflict with the collective interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The products of groups have an enormous
significance in our lives. In the past, when
manufacturing was the predominant industry,
the pooling of physical effort was important.
More recently, as more jobs are generated in the
knowledge industry, joint effort in cognitive tasks
has gained in importance. Examples of
collective effort on cognitive tasks include writing
a joint report, developing a commercial
computer program, or operating an air traffic control
system. In addition, globalization is leading to
faster moving societies and changing traditional
values. Values like modesty, diligence and honesty
have the taste of being old-fashioned, while
self-actualization, pursuing a career and
cultivating a healthy narcissism are on the agenda
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(e.g. Hogan &amp; Blake, 1996)</xref>
        . If the spirit of the
21st century is dominated by pursuing one’s own
individual goals, and on the other hand, team
work is important, then an issue arises as to what
types of people can work effectively in teams.
In the current research, we address the issue
of whether all individuals are equally inclined
to loaf in collective work, or whether there is a
way to differentiate systematically team workers
from team loafers. After all, when team work is
so important, a way to identify those who still
exert effort in groups would seem important
for all concerned. Before we turn to the specific
question of what motivates people to contribute
to a group product, we will briefly summarize the
social psychological explanations for reduced
group productivity.

      <title>Motivation losses in group work</title>
      <p>
        Since the discovery and analysis of the Ringelmann
effect
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref26 ref31">(see Ingham, Levinger, Graves, &amp; Peckham,
1974; Kravitz &amp; Martin, 1986; Moede, 1927)</xref>
        ,
we know that group work compared to
individual work often results in productivity losses.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">Latane et al. (1979)</xref>
        showed that the decreased
productivity is caused both by coordination
loss and by effort reduction. They interpreted
the effort reduction as a result of motivation
losses and called it ‘social loafing’. With
emerging research the phenomenon of motivation
losses in groups has been given different labels
depending on the circumstantial conditions.
Social loafing stems from the realization that
the individual contribution cannot be
identified and thus evaluated
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Harkins &amp; Jackson,
1985)</xref>
        . The potential for evaluation can come
from other group members, external sources (e.g.
the experimenter), or from the possibility for
self-evaluation, and any of these can eliminate the
effect
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref38">(Harkins &amp; Szymanski, 1989; Szymanski &amp;
Harkins, 1987)</xref>
        . Free-riding stems from the
perception that the individual’s contribution is
dispensable, even if it is identifiable and
appraisable
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref25 ref3">(Kerr &amp; Brunn, 1983; for a detailed analysis
of task type and possible motivation losses in
the framework of social dilemmas, see also
Arnscheid, Diehl &amp; Stroebe, 1997)</xref>
        . The
suckereffect results from the perception that others
are free-riding on one’s contributions or efforts
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Orbell &amp; Dawes, 1981)</xref>
        . In this case it is the
potential of the averseness of this role, which
makes the individual reduce his/her effort.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref25">Kerr (1983)</xref>
        argues that the violation of certain
social norms like the equity norm, the norm of
reciprocity and the norm of social
responsibility make the sucker role uncomfortable. In the
last decade motivation losses in group
performance have been linked to general theories of
motivation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref34 ref35">(Karau &amp; Williams, 1993; Shepperd,
1993; Shepperd &amp; Taylor, 1999)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>The proposed underlying mechanism for the
free-rider effect and social loafing are based on
the assumption that individuals’ main driving
force is to maximize individual outcomes while
minimizing input. The proposed underlying
mechanism for the sucker-effect is, in a sense,
distinct from the other two, as it is based on the
assumption that behavior can also be driven by
other motives and needs like feeling socially
equal and accepted. An obvious question is
whether other motives, as for instance seeing
work as something valuable per se, may play
important roles in group work also.</p>

      <title>What moderates motivation losses in group work</title>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Karau and Williams’ (1993)</xref>
        meta-analytic
review concludes that motivation losses in group
work is a robust phenomenon which generalizes
across tasks and populations. Above we have
briefly mentioned variables that play a role in
the underlying processes of motivation losses
in groups. Among those, evaluation potential,
expectations of coworker performance, task
meaningfulness and culture were found to have
a consistent impact
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Karau &amp; Williams, 1993)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, individual differences have also
been shown to moderate motivation losses in
groups. Need for cognition refers to the
tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive
endeavors
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1982)</xref>
        .
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">Smith, Kerr,
Markus, and Stasson (2001</xref>
        ) demonstrated that
the need for cognition can moderate motivation
losses in group work: individuals high in need
for cognition worked equally hard on a vigilance
task, regardless of whether they were working
collectively or coactively. Individuals low in need
for cognition, however, exerted considerably less
effort when working collectively compared to
working coactively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Hart, Karau, Stasson, and Kerr (2004</xref>
        ) showed
that people high in achievement motivation
exerted equal effort whether they were
working coactively or collectively and whether they
expected the other person to exert high or low
effort. However, people low in achievement
motivation reduced their effort most when
working collectively with somebody from whom
they expected high effort. Hence, apparently they
reduced their effort when they perceived their
contribution as dispensable and not identifiable.
However, what is not clear in their study is how
participants interpreted the allegedly predicted
effort of their team member. When induced to
expect low effort, participants received the
message that their team partner found the task
very interesting but was not going to exert
much effort on it. This message is ambiguous.
Participants could have attributed the reduced
effort of their partner to their lack of willingness
or of capability. Neither of these attributions is
compelling. On the one hand, why would
somebody reduce effort on a task that she/he finds
interesting? On the other hand, why would lack
of ability lead to a reduction of effort?
Moreover, the source of attribution for the reduced
effort plays an important role in social loafing.
Reduced input from a team member due to
lack of ability evokes quite different reactions
than reduced effort due to a lack of willingness
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref25">(Kerr, 1983)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>As noted above, previous research has shown
that need for cognition and achievement
motivation moderate reduction of effort in collective
work. However, effects of these moderators would
not differ depending on whether a partner’s
reduced effort stemmed from unwillingness
or inability. People high in need for cognition
or achievement motivation would sustain their
effort regardless of the reason for the partner’s
reduced effort. In these cases, the enjoyment of
the task (need for cognition) or the desire to
achieve are not dampened by a partner’s lack of
motivation or ability. However, beliefs regarding
the value of work and the importance of equity
should moderate one’s reactions to a partner
and her/his reasons for reducing effort.
In 1905 Max Weber published ‘The Protestant
ethic and the spirit of capitalism’. The basic idea
was that the Protestant ethic was an important
factor in the economic success of Protestant
groups in the early stages of capitalism. Worldly
success was interpreted as a sign of righteousness
and therefore vigorously pursued. Since Weber,
anthropologists, economists, sociologists,
historians and psychologists have been interested
in the issue of the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE).
Psychologists were not concerned with whether
Weber was right or wrong but translated the
concept into an individual difference construct.</p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">McClelland (1961)</xref>
        was the first to use the
concept of PWE within psychology. His explanation
for the association between Protestantism
and capitalism was the following. Parents, who
have internalized Protestant values, reared their
children in ways that foster independence,
rationality and delay of gratification. Instilling
these values produces children with a high
achievement motivation, and people with a
high achievement motivation are very likely
to contribute to the expansion of business. He
subsumed the concept of PWE under need for
achievement. Placing PWE in this conceptual
context has been criticized because it emphasizes
only the ‘hard work-aspect’ of the work ethic and
leaves out other aspects. Nonetheless, the idea
that high achievement motivation is a relatively
stable disposition which has its roots in early
socialization led others to construe PWE
beliefs as an individual difference of conceptual
interest. The research focus shifted from the
etiology of the PWE to the measurement of the
construct and to its relationships to behavior
patterns and other belief systems. Several
selfreport measures were developed
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref12 ref17 ref18 ref30 ref33 ref4 ref44 ref50 ref6">(e.g. Blood,
1969; Buchholz, 1976; Goldstein &amp; Eichhorn,
1961; Hammond &amp; Williams, 1976; Ho, 1984;
Mirels &amp; Garrett, 1971; Ray, 1982)</xref>
        . Using these
measures, PWE has been shown to correlate with
behaviors and other constructs. Persons with
a high PWE are industrious, ambitious, hard
working and intrinsically motivated
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8 ref9">(Furnham,
1990a)</xref>
        , stemming from the attitude that work
will and should pay off. They tend to have an
internal locus of control in matters that are
linked to work
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Lied &amp; Pritchard, 1976)</xref>
        and
are not easily affected by external factors. Their
behavioral orientation in a free-choice period is
to work equally hard on the task regardless of the
performance feedback
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8 ref9">(Furnham, 1990a)</xref>
        .
Moreover, they are inclined to apply an equity norm,
as opposed to an equality norm, in deciding how
to distribute a resource
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Greenberg, 1978)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Equity norm refers to a proportional input–
output relation. People perceive a distribution
as fair when their own ratio of inputs to outputs
equals the input–output ratio of others. Put
differently, according to equity norm, rewards
should be distributed in direct proportion to
the effort each group member exerts
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref39">(Adams,
1965; Walster, Berscheid &amp; Walster, 1973)</xref>
        .
In contrast to that, the equality norm does not
focus on the input–output relation in
determining whether justice or injustice is perceived,
but merely on an equal size of the output. Hence,
the equality norm would suggest an equal
distribution of rewards irrespective of inputs

        as well as Furnham
(1990b) delivered empirical evidence that
the global construct ‘PWE’ consists of several
components. Thus different components might
be responsible for the behavioral correlates and
associations with other personality constructs
and attitudes, which were described above. For
example, a high work ethic is associated with a
preference for the equity norm and the belief
in the instrumental value of work (‘work should
and does pay off’) and the belief in the ethical
value of work (‘it is ethical to be occupied with
work’); whereas people with a low work ethic are
extrinsically motivated and prefer the equality
norm when asked to divide a reward, and do not

        <title>Overview</title>
        <p>In order to test the research hypotheses, a
situation was designed that permitted free-riding,
and another situation was designed that made
participants vulnerable to the sucker-effect.
Also included were two corresponding control
conditions. Participants worked in dyads on a
potentially divisible task.</p>
        <p>In the free-rider condition, participants were
led to believe that their partner was capable of
the task by the initial feedback on the task
performance. In the free-rider control condition,
participants performed the task individually.</p>
        <p>In the sucker effect condition, hereafter referred
to as the sucker condition, the partner of the
participant is portrayed as capable by the initial
feedback on task performance. The feedback
after the first three trials revealed that the team
did quite well on the task, but that the
participant’s contribution consistently exceeded the
‘partner’s’ contribution. The ‘partner’ of the
participant was a confederate of the experimenter. In
order to have the participants really attribute the
‘partner’s’ smaller contribution to his reduced
effort and not to lower ability, the confederate
displayed boredom by scripted behavior. In
the sucker effect control condition, hereafter
referred to as the sucker control condition, the
participant’s contribution exceeded the
‘partner’s’ contribution. But here the participant was
led to believe by the initial task performance
feedback that their partner’s task ability was
low. During the initial trials, the confederate
commented on the difficulty of the task.</p>

Thus, the design was a four independent group

          . Despite the theoretical
inclusion of the equity/equality norm in the
concept of PWE as a variable of individual
differences, these scales do not include items that
measure directly a preference for equity or
equality. Therefore, nine additional items were
created to assess the degree to which participants
endorse the equity norm. Examples of such
items are: ‘The trouble with giving people equal
rewards for work is that they very rarely work
equally hard’ or ‘When a task is completed by a
team there is nothing wrong with distributing the

        <title>Task</title>
        <p>
          The task that the participants performed in
three trials was the ‘d2’ concentration test
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Brickenkamp, 1994)</xref>
          . In this test, participants
are confronted with a sheet full of the letters
‘d’ and ‘p’ which have one to four lines above
or beneath them. The task is to work through
the lines of letters and cross out every ‘d’ that
has two lines with it. To provide a rationale for
participants to complete this task in teams and
to deflect their attention from our interest in
individual performance in collective endeavors,
the following cover story was presented:
This study is about how to design the task of manually
checking transfer slips most efficiently. In most
instances one fills in forms nowadays using the
computer. However, some service providers, like banks,
are still obliged to offer other possibilities for clients
to hand in forms. Service providers let clients also
use forms, which can be filled in by hand, but can
later be read by a computer. People are instructed
how to fill in these forms, so that the computer can
read them, but still a given percentage cannot be
read by the computers. When the computers read
the forms, the information is translated into a code.
This code then appears on a screen, and consists
of signs and abnormalities. The signs represent
information from the transfer slip that could be
read properly, whereas the abnormalities stem
from information that could not be read properly.
Somebody has to detect the abnormalities, which
demands a continuously high concentration and is
a boring task. A short period of inattention will lead
to a greater amount of undetected abnormalities,
which will be noticed in the succeeding processing.
The study tests whether sharing the task so that the
code would come up on two screens has an
impact. Another feature that the study addresses is
whether and how much feedback and feedback
frequencies have an impact on performance. Hence,
participants will be working on a task, where they
have to detect abnormal signs in a list of abnormal
and normal signs (they were doing this either with
another person or alone) and will be given feedback
in regular frequencies.

        <title>Procedure</title>
        <p>After arrival participants were asked to
complete the PWE questionnaires, which were said
to be part of a different research project. They
were then told the alleged purpose of the study
before they were randomly assigned to one of
the four conditions. With the exception of
the free-rider control condition, participants
were told that they would work at the task as a
cooperative team and that their performances
would be summed and they would be rewarded
for their combined performance regardless
of their individual contributions. Participants
were guaranteed £2 as a reward and they were
told that they could earn up to £3 depending
on their combined performance. £3 was worth
approximately US$5. Eventually everybody was
paid £3. Participants were then made familiar
with the requirements of the task by practicing on
a line of letters. During the actual experimental
trials participants were wearing headphones.
The command to start was given via these
headphones. Furthermore, during the trials there
was office noise in the room in order to prevent
the participants from overhearing each other’s
speed.</p>
        <p>The first trial lasted for one minute and
participants were told that this trial was meant to
assess their initial ability. The second to the
fourth trials lasted for two and a half minutes
each. The experimenter left the room while the
‘teams’ were actually working on the task.
Behavior in the room could be monitored through
a glass window in the door. After each trial the
experimenter returned, took the sheets from
the participants and allegedly scored them in
the same room.</p>
        <p>Participants were told that their feedback
would compare their performance to the
average performance by other participants. In all
experimental conditions participants were given
the feedback after the first trial in which their
own performance, which was supposedly the
initial ability, was 20% above average. In the sucker
condition and the free-rider condition they were told
that their partner’s performance was 20% above
average as well, whereas in the control condition
to the sucker-effect the performance feedback for
the partner was 5% below average.</p>
        <p>After the first trial in the sucker condition, the
confederate yawned and stretched and started
to lean back with his chair while the sheets were
corrected. After the second trial he again leaned
backwards and began to drum with his fingers
on the table. The performance feedback then
revealed a combined result around 20% above
average and a contribution of the participant to
the total of about 60%. After the third trial the
confederate mumbled to himself ‘it’s getting
boring’, while the experimenter was still outside
the room. The performance feedback for this
trial then again revealed a combined result that
was 20% above average, to which the participant
had again contributed more than 60%.</p>
        <p>In the sucker control condition the confederate
said after the first trial, ‘I can’t tell them apart’.
After the second trial he moaned and said to
himself ‘it is really difficult’. The combined
result was said to be 20% above average and the
contribution of the participant about 60%. After
the third trial the confederate said ‘not easy’
while handing his sheet over to the experimenter.
Feedback for this trial then revealed the same
result as for the second trial.</p>
        <p>In the free-rider condition participants were
told after the second and third trials that they
together achieved 20% above average; no
information was given concerning the individual
contributions to the team performance. In the
free-rider control condition participants were given
the feedback that they achieved about 20% above
average after each trial.</p>
        <p>Feedback was never provided after the fourth
trial in any of the four experimental conditions.
After the fourth trial, participants were asked
to complete a questionnaire that functioned as
a manipulation check. Participants were then
debriefed, thanked and paid.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The PWE
In order to disentangle the components of the
global construct a principal component factor
analysis with varimax rotation was conducted
using all of the items from the questionnaires.
A scree plot indicated the presence of three
factors. These three factors accounted for 38.6%
of the variance. The first factor accounted for
13.23% of the variance. Items loading high on
this factor portray the attitude that work has a
moral value. It was therefore called the Ethical
Factor. The second factor explained 12.9% of
the variance. Items loading high on this factor
capture the notion that work should and will
pay off. It was therefore called the Instrumental
Factor. The third factor explained 12.5% of
the variance, and items loading high on this
factor measure the attitude to the equity
principle. This factor was called the Equity Factor.
Examples for items loading high on the
respective factors can be found in the Appendix.
Factor scores were computed to be used later
as a measure of individual differences on the
three dimensions.</p>
      <sec id="sec-6-1">
        <title>Analysis of the performance data</title>
        <p>Four participants had to be excluded from the
analysis; one had suspicions about the
confederate and the other three did not complete
the task properly. Table 1 reveals the mean
raw performance scores in all four conditions
for the four trials. Raw performances are the
number of all correctly marked signs minus
all false positives (signs marked which should
not have been) and misses (unmarked signs
that should have been marked prior to the last
correctly marked sign).</p>
        <p>The primary dependent variable was
performance on the fourth trial. As depicted in Table 1,
scores in the fourth trial in the free-rider
condition (M = 282.26) and in the sucker
condition (M = 279.47) were lower than in the
free-rider control condition (M = 316.8) and in
the control condition sucker-effect (M = 295.8).</p>
        <p>A one-way analysis of covariance was performed,
with the performance in the fourth trial as a
dependent variable, and the performance on
the first trial as a covariate. The first trial was
used as a covariate in order to control for
individual differences in performance before the
introduction of the experimental manipulations
and hence reduce error variance. There was
a main effect of the condition (F(3, 71) = 3.2,
p &lt; .028). Also the effect of the covariate was
significant (F(1, 71) = 58,7, p &lt; .001). Table 2
contains the mean performances adjusted for
the covariate.</p>
        <p>Two contrasts were calculated to test for the
free-rider effect and the sucker-effect,
respectively. The comparison for the free-rider to the
free-rider control was significant (F(1, 67) = 5.67,
p &lt; .05). The comparison of the sucker effect</p>
        <p>Condition 1:
Free-rider effect

        <title>Sucker and free-rider effects and PWE</title>
        <p>A regression analysis was conducted using only
participants from the sucker control condition
and the sucker effect condition. The regression
model used performance on the fourth trial as
the dependent variable and trial 1 performance,
sucker effect conditions and scores on the
original PWE scale as predictors. Also included
was an interaction term of condition by PWE
score. All predictors were centered before the
regression was conducted. The effect of the trial 1
performance and sucker condition were
significant, confirming the results from the foregoing
covariance analysis. The interaction of sucker
condition by score on PWE scale was only
marginally significant (t(32) = 1.58, p &gt; .12). Thus
the sucker effect was marginally moderated by
people’s score on the global PWE scale.</p>
        <p>A regression analysis was conducted using only

the free-rider control condition. The regression

the regression was conducted. The effect of the
trial 1 performance and free rider conditions
were significant, confirming the results from the

PWE score was not significant (t(34) &lt; 1, ns).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-3">
        <title>Sucker-effect and PWE factors</title>
        <p>For each of the PWE factors, a regression
analysis was conducted using only participants
from the sucker control condition and the
sucker-effect condition. The regression model
used performance on the fourth trial as the
dependent variable and trial 1 performance,
sucker-effect conditions and factor scores as
predictors. Also included was an interaction
term of condition by respective factor score.
All predictors were centered before conducting
the regression. In all the regressions the effect
of the trial 1 performance and sucker condition
were significant, confirming the results from the
covariance analysis. The interaction of sucker
condition by factor score was significant for all
components: instrumental factors (t(36) = 2.01,
p &gt; .05), ethical factor (t(36) = 2.19, p &lt; .036) and
equity factor (t(36) = 2.06, p &lt; .048). Thus the
sucker-effect was different for people who scored
high and low on all of the PWE factors.</p>
        <p>To better understand the nature of the
interactions of PWE factors and the
suckereffect, estimated means for people scoring one
standard deviation above and one standard
deviation below the mean on each factor were
obtained using the regression model. These
estimated means are plotted for participants
in the experimental sucker and sucker control
conditions in Figures 1 to 3.</p>
        <p>Participants, who endorsed the idea that work
should and will pay off, worked almost as hard
in the sucker control condition (M = 285.09) as
they did in the sucker experimental condition
(M = 281.69). But participants who did not see
work as something that should and will pay
off worked harder when working with
somebody who was contributing less because of
ability (M = 306.44), than when working with
someone who contributed less due to lack of
effort (M = 272.05). Thus, people endorsing the
instrumental value of work were not affected by
being the sucker. They seemed to focus more on
their part of the work even if the other was not
working hard. People who believed less in the
long-range instrumental value of work worked
harder when their partner was incapable than
when he was unwilling to exert effort.</p>
        <p>Endorsement of the ethical value of work
and of equity produced similar patterns in
the sucker conditions. When their partner was
incapable, participants who endorsed the ethical
value of work (M = 306.84) and who endorsed
the equity principle (M = 310.32) worked
harder than those who did not subscribe to the
ethical value of work (M = 263.18) and to the
principle of equity (M = 271.4). In contrast,
participants who did not endorse the ethical
value of work and participants who subscribed
to the equality principle exerted about the same
effort regardless of whether their partner was
performing poorly due to inability or due to
lack of trying. So apparently belief in the ethical
value of work and adherence to the equity
principle led participants to compensate for an
incapable partner but to avoid being a sucker.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-4">
        <title>Free-rider effect and PWE factors</title>
        <p>For each of the PWE factors, a regression
analysis was conducted using only participants
from the free rider condition and the free
rider control condition. The regression model
used performance on the fourth trial as the
dependent variable and trial 1 performance,
free rider effect conditions and scale score as
predictors. Also included was an interaction term
of condition by scale score. All predictors were
centered before the regression was conducted.
In all the regressions the effect of the trial 1
performance and free rider conditions were
significant, confirming the results from the
covariance analysis. The predicted interaction of
free-rider condition by instrumental scale score
was only marginally significant (t(38) = 1.49
p &lt; .07, one-tailed). The interactions with the
equity and ethical scale were not significant.
Thus the free-rider effect was marginally
different only for people who scored high and low
on the instrumental component of PWE. The
estimated means for people scoring one standard
deviation above and one standard deviation
below the mean on the instrumental factor were
obtained using the regression model. These
estimated means are plotted for participants
in the experimental free-rider and free rider
control conditions in Figure 4.</p>
        <p>Participants who believed in the instrumental
value of work showed no difference in
performance in the free rider control condition
(M = 312.82) and the free-rider experimental
condition (M = 307.36). But participants who
did not believe in the instrumental value of work
were affected by the situational circumstances in
their effort exertion. When working alone, they
worked harder (M = 309.66) than when working
as a team (M = 262.52) with an allegedly skilled
person and individual contributions were not
identifiable.</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the
moderating effects of attitudes toward work, as
embodied in the global construct of the PWE,
on motivation losses in performance groups. We
distinguished two types of motivation loss which
we suggest involve distinctly different
psychological processes. More specifically, the
suckereffect is a reaction to reduced effort by others
in collective work and, as the name implies, to
the potential of one’s own effort being exploited
by others. The free-rider effect is the robust
tendency to reduce effort in collective work when
individual contributions are not identifiable.
Our experimental setup induced both
suckerand free-rider effects. When participants were
working with another individual and their
individual contributions were combined and
unidentifiable, they produced less than when they
thought they were working alone—the classic
free-rider effect. When they were working with
another person whose output was relatively low,
they produced less when they thought the other
person was not trying than when they thought
the other person was not capable—the classic
sucker-effect.</p>
      <p>
        Our purpose was to examine whether
components of PWE moderate the inclinations
to reduce effort in the free-riding and sucker
conditions. Based on past work with PWE
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref8 ref9">(e.g.
Furnham,1990b; Heaven, 1989)</xref>
        , we anticipated
that the global construct was a combination
of at least three components: belief that work
will be rewarded (instrumental component),
belief that hard work is a marker of righteousness
(ethical component) and belief that people
ought to be rewarded equitably for their work
(equity component). We constructed the gobal
measure of PWE from items taken from
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Mirels
and Garrett (1971)</xref>
        and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18">Ho and Lloyd (1984)</xref>
        and
added additional items designed to measure
more preferences for equity in the distribution of
resources. We factor analyzed responses to items
from this global measure and obtained distinct
factors that corresponded to the anticipated
components of belief in the ethical value of work,
the instrumental value of work and the equity
principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though they are distinct, conceptually and
empirically, the factors are strongly correlated
with the traditional measures of PWE. For
example the instrumental factor correlated
.85 with the
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18">Ho and Lloyd’s (1984)</xref>
        PWE scale
and .48 with the PWE scale used by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Mirels and
Garrett (1971)</xref>
        . The ethical factor also correlated
strongly with the Mirels and Garrett scale (r = .74)
but modestly with the Ho and Lloyd measure
(r = .27). The equity factor, not surprisingly given
that it consisted largely of items not contained in
these traditional measures, correlated modestly
both with the Mirels and Garrett scale (r = .38)
and with the Ho and Lloyd scale (r = .27).
      </p>
      <p>We expected that these components of PWE
would moderate free-riding and sucker- effects
in different ways. Concerning the sucker-effect
and a potential moderating role of the PWE,
we had two contrasting hypotheses. On the one
hand, we speculated that people high in the
instrumental value component of PWE would
not show the sucker-effect because of their belief
that hard work pays off in the long run. On the
other hand, people who subscribe strongly to
an equity norm should show the sucker-effect
in that they would react to the violation of the
equity norm in a situation where a partner is, by
choice, coasting. Thus, we did not expect that
the global measure of PWE would moderate the
sucker-effect and it did not.</p>
      <p>Our expectation regarding the moderating
influence of the instrumental component on the
sucker-effect was confirmed. Participants who
believed in the long-range instrumental value of
work were not affected by the reasons for their
partner’s low output. Whether he contributed
less than the participant due to lack of ability
or to lack of motivation did not seem to matter
to them. In contrast, participants who did not
endorse the instrumental value of work exerted
more effort when their partner was incapable
rather than lazy. Somewhat surprisingly, these
participants who were low on the instrumental
component actually worked harder when
paired with an incapable partner than did the
participants who were high on the instrumental
component. Thus, it seems that people who
do not subscribe to the instrumental value of
work are willing to compensate for a capability
deficit, perhaps in order to gain the
immediate incentives for high production. That is, for
them, work may not lead invariably to rewards
or be rewarding in itself but, when benefits are
directly tied to collective production, they will
compensate for less capable coworkers.</p>
      <p>As predicted, participants who endorsed the
equity principle were affected by the sucker
manipulations. If their partner provided the
impression that the participant could become
the sucker, those who reported a preference for
equity over equality reduced their effort
considerably. In comparison, when they thought
their team partner was less capable at the
task, they exerted extra effort to compensate
for their partner’s deficits. Apparently it matters
for people endorsing the equity principle
why a coworker’s contributions are subpar. If
poor performance is due to a lack of ability, they
almost appear to act according to the principle
that input should be proportional to individual
resources or ability. If they do not have any
reason to believe that resources or abilities are
disproportionate, they are sensitive to the subpar
contributions of their partner and exert less
effort. People who are more likely to endorse
the equality norm do not seem to be affected
by the reason for their partner’s lesser input.
If it appears to be lack of motivation or skill,
it does not seem to affect them. They do not
endorse the equity norm, and consequently, it
seems that they do not experience any danger
of becoming a sucker in the light of a violation
of such a norm.</p>
      <p>People who see hard work as an ethical marker
also react to the apparent reasons that a coworker
is performing poorly. Participants who believed
in the ethical value of work were affected by the
apparent cause of their partners’ inferior
contributions to the collective product. They, like
equity endorsers seemed willing to compensate
for lack of ability. However, they reduced their
input when the partner was loafing. Thus, the
ethical value that people see in work is not simply
self-focused (i.e. ‘If I work hard, I am good’) but
also other-focused (i.e. ‘Lazy people are bad’).
In other words, people who believe in the ethical
value of work have a broader moral concern.
When they are working with somebody who does
not seem to spend much effort on the task, they
are not willing to compensate for the other’s
lack of effort and, in the spirit of defending
their moral claim, are prepared to forego
part of their reward. Hence defending their
moral claim seems more important than the
external reward. People who do not believe in
the ethical value of work, have less of a mission
to defend some ethical principle, and hence do
not appear to experience great psychological
costs if another person might free-ride on their
effort. Consequently they exerted the same
effort, no matter whether the other person was
incapable or not motivated.</p>
      <p>Contrary to our predictions, the global PWE
measure did not moderate the free-rider effect.
Moreover, the free rider effect was only weakly
related to the belief in the instrumental value
of work. The trends suggest that people who
believe in the notion that work should and will
pay off did not take advantage of the
possibility to free-ride on somebody else’s effort. They
worked equally hard when working alone and
when working with another when
contributions were not identifiable. Participants who
believed to a lesser extent in the instrumental
value of work were affected by the social context.
When it needed their individual effort to get the
reward they worked much harder, compared to
the situation in which they could free-ride on
somebody else’s effort.</p>
      <p>In sum, neither the sucker effect nor the
freerider effect was moderated by the global
construct of PWE. However the sucker-effect seemed
to be moderated in different ways by the three
components of the PWE, namely the belief
in the ethical value of work, the belief in the
instrumental value of work and the endorsement
of the equity principle. The free-rider effect,
on the other hand, seems to be only marginally
moderated by the belief in the instrumental
value of work.</p>
      <p>Sucker and free-rider effects seem to be
qualitatively different motivation losses in group
performance. The sucker-effect is moderated by
beliefs about the instrumental and ethical value
of work and preferences for equity, whereas these
components tells us less about who is likely to
free-ride. One potentially contributing difference
between avoiding being the sucker and
freeriding is that avoiding the sucker role is a reaction
to the behavior, anticipated or actual, of another
person. In the experimental manipulation of the
sucker-effect, the other person is giving the
impression that he is lowering their input because
he does not feel like working hard. Consequently
the participant sees the danger that he might
be exploited, and the psychological cost of
exploitation is higher than foregoing part of the
monetary reward for high productivity. But
these psychological costs are not experienced
by everybody alike. More specifically, it is subject
to individual differences that are bundled in the
PWE construct. A high belief in the instrumental
value of work makes you immune to the
suckereffect. Thus, instrumental value seems to be
a more self-focused belief in the long-range
benefits of working hard and thus less responsive
to the social context. A strong endorsement
of the equity principle makes one particularly
vulnerable to the sucker-effect. Seemingly, the
psychological costs of exploitation are perceived
as high by people who believe in equity, and
thus they avoid being the sucker. Interestingly
a strong belief in the ethical value of work also
makes one especially vulnerable to the sucker
effect, suggesting that the cost of compensating
for another’s laziness is too costly.</p>
      <p>The free-rider effect does not seem to be
affected so strongly by the PWE components.
Although it appears that belief in the instrumental
value of work may reduce free-riding, this
evidence in our data is statistically weak.
Moreover, we obtained no evidence that the ethical
value and equity preference moderate
freeriding. One possible reason is that people may
not be aware of the reduction of effort that we
label free-riding. If they are not aware that they
are working less hard in a collective effort, their
beliefs about the work and equity may not be
relevant. Moreover, it is clear that motivation
loss in a free-rider situation is less of an affective
reaction than in a sucker effect condition. From
a certain perspective, free-riding seems rational.
That is, reducing effort in team situations after
getting joint feedback that the team is doing
well could be an adaptive approach to collective
endeavors. In the long run, it is functional to
save one’s resources when they are apparently
not needed for future endeavors when they
may be needed. This strategy does not
necessarily contradict the ethical value of work.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we examined individual
differences in free-riding and sucker-effects in
collective work. People who believe in equity and
the ethical value of work are particularly sensitive
to being the sucker and, thus, reduce their own
effort rather than compensate for the laziness
of a coworker. By comparison, people who
believe that work should and will be rewarded in
the long-run do not seem to react to being the
sucker. There is also a tendency for these people
who believe in the instrumental value of work
to be less likely to free-ride. One implication is
that belief in the instrumental value of work is
a guide for one’s own behavior: ‘If I work hard,
I will be rewarded’. In contrast, both the ethical
component of PWE and the equity norm are
prescriptions not only about how one should
act but also how one should react to others’
expenditures of effort in collective work.</p>
