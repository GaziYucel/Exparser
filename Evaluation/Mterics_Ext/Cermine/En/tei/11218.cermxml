        <p>Research hypotheses from various migration-theory approaches are tested through a study focusing on a sample of 1,560 IT university students in India, just prior to the completion of their studies. The representative survey was conducted across India during the summer of 2003. The effect of economic and socio-political factors on the students' willingness to migrate was examined by using variance analysis. The results show, on the one hand, a generally high willingness among those surveyed to migrate to industrialised countries, but on the other hand, a substantial number of IT-students want to stay in their home country, India. Economic factors tend to play a much greater role on their migration decisions, rather than say the sending or receiving country's institutional or socio-political aspects. The significance test of individual factors shows that economic as well as institutional considerations; such as good career opportunities, a high income, and a high living standard, are considerably more important than other socio-political as well as institutional factors. Indian IT graduates evaluated better career opportunities much higher in their home country as compared to other locations. In an explicit location comparison of Germany with India and the United States/Canada - the classic immigration countries - as one of the potential host countries, the respondents rated only language/culture significantly higher for the United States/Canada than for Germany. The remaining economic and socio-political factors were rated higher for USA/Canada but do not show any significant differences between Germany, India, and USA/Canada. Interestingly, a location comparison of India with Germany and United States/Canada shows that IT graduates evaluated (salary, career opportunity, self employment, language/culture and social networks) significantly higher for their native country than for Germany and United States/Canada. Hence, in an international competition for skilled labour/best IT specialists, India has also emerged as an attractive location.</p>

      <title>Zur Bewertung der Migrationsentscheidung von IT-Hochschulabsolventen aus Indien: Eine Empirische Untersuchung</title>
      <p>Wir testen Forschungshypothesen aus migrationtheoretischen Ansätzen
anhand einer Stichprobe von 1,560 kurz von dem Studienabschluss stehenden
IT-Hochschulabsolventen aus Indien. Die repräsentative Befragung wurde im
Sommer 2003 landesweit in Indien durchgeführt. Mit Hilfe der Varianzanalyse
wird die Wirkung der ökonomischen sowie gesellschaftspolitischen
Einflussfaktoren auf die Migrationbereitschaft der Hochschulabsolventen
untersucht. Die Ergebnisse zeigen einerseits eine hohe generelle
Migrationbereitschaft der indischen IT-Absolventen in Industrieländer. Andererseits ist
aber das Verbleiben in ihrem Heimatland Indien eine starke Alternative.
Ökonomische Gründe spielen generell für die Migrationentscheidung eine viel
wichtigere Rolle als andere institutionelle oder gesellschaftspolitische Aspekte
im Herkunfts- und Empfängerland. Der Signifikanztest der einzelnen
Einflussfaktoren bestätigt, dass ökonomische Gründe wie gute
Karrieremöglichkeiten, hohes Einkommen und besserer Lebensstandard bei allen
Empfängerländern signifikant wichtiger sind als die gesellschaftspolitischen Determinanten
(wie Ausländerfeindlichkeiten, Aufenthalterlaubnis, Sprache und Soziale
Netzwerke). Indische IT-Hochschulabsolventen bewerten gute
Karrieremöglichkeiten höher in Ihrem Heimland als bei allen Empfängerländern. Bei einem
konkreten Standortvergleich zwischen Deutschland, Indien und dem
klassischen Immigrationsland USA bewerten die Befragten die Determinanten
(wie Soziale Netzwerke, Karrieremöglichkeiten, Möglichkeit der
Selbstständigkeit, das Gehalt und Sprache) signifikant wichtiger für Ihr Heimatland als für die
USA und Deutschland. Im Wettbewerb um die besten IT-Experten ist Indien im
Vergleich zu Nordamerikanischen Ländern und Deutschland ebenfalls ein
attraktiver Standort.</p>
      <sec id="sec-1-1">
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The starting point of current discussions about foreign immigration into Germany has been
skill shortages on the German labour market. Particularly for specialists in information and
telecommunications technology, the mismatch on the German labour market has now
reached the critical point where it is actually inhibiting growth. Both the increasing worldwide
competition for highly qualified specialists and managers and globalisation trends, in general
have resulted in increased emigration of German skilled workers and, at the same time,
create the need for greater immigration into growth markets. The problem has recently been
attracting growing attention from actors in industry and commerce, public policy and politics
(Unabhängige Kommission Zuwanderung, 2001). The demand for information technology
(IT) specialists is particularly strong with respect to specific types of technical knowledge
(e.g. programming languages) and special “international skills”, such as opening up foreign
product markets for companies and their partners.1</p>
        <p>The most influential factors behind these trends are increasing globalisation and
demographic changes. Stalker (2000) referred to the strong globalisation effect in connection
with a heightened degree of labour mobility in the twenty-first century. Labour mobility —
caused by growing pressure on the labour supply, increasing disparities in income between
respective countries and, above all, the revolutionary development of information and
communication technologies — will play an increasingly important role in the international
dissemination of knowledge and technology. On the other hand, demographic changes over
the last few decades have been leading to a population decline in Germany and are having
unwelcomed side-effects on economic development and innovative capacity.</p>
        <p>The consequences of these trends for Germany have become all too evident: more
intense international competition for the most talented, a growing demand for well-qualified
workers, an expansion of the markets, and a competitive disadvantage in the information and
communication technology fields as a result of high wage costs.</p>
        <p>
          Two main reasons are given for the shortage of specialists in Germany: first, the
constantly changing state of the computer technology and its continued rapid growth
worldwide, and, second, the failure of German universities and polytechnic colleges to
provide workers with training that is adequately geared to the needs of the labour market.
Therefore, in order to roughly meet skill needs further training and retraining schemes for the
available domestic labour force are necessary, as are efforts, already underway, to build up
the number of students and graduates in these fields
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Neugart, 2000)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>This long-term labour shortage is considered to be the overall cause for the
emergence of so-called migration flows. To solve this problem, the German Federal
1</p>
        <p>According to the IZA International Employer Survey 2000 findings (IZA – Forschungsinstitut zur
Zukunft der Arbeit [Institute for the Study of Labor], Bonn), for which 340 telephone interviews in
Germany and 170 interviews each in France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were
conducted (Winkelmann, 2001).
Government, in cooperation with industry and commerce, has now established a “Green
Card Emergency Programme to Meet the Demand for IT-Specialists” (Green Card
Sofortprogramm zur Deckung des IT- Fachkräftebedarfs:
http://www.bma.bund.de/download/broschueren/a232.pdf) which enables such specialists
from non-EU countries to work in Germany for up to five years. In view of the prevailing
domestic labour market problems, economic migration was not a desirable option. Most do
agree, however, that a selective migration policy would bring overall economic benefits to
recruitment countries (Zimmermann, 1996).</p>
        <p>Migration research shows that the scale of international migration will increase
overall. Little, however, is known about the determinants of past and present migratory
movements, in particular those of IT specialists and highly educated persons, who could
generate such migration flows (Regets, 2001). Current discussions still focus on whether a
selective policy would bring overall economic benefits. What is more, the topic of immigration
itself seems to be a controversial matter in Germany, both socially and politically.</p>
        <p>
          Particularly with regard to immigration from developing countries, no extensive
empirical research has been carried out to date, which takes into consideration not only the
economic and social aspects of migration but also the political and institutional factors.
Vogler (1999) has analysed these factors using an aggregated panel data set of
asylumseekers who migrated from developing countries. A study by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Fiedler (2000)</xref>
          deals with the
question of the conditions for which highly qualified IT workers migrate from India to
Germany. To conduct this study a questionnaire was used to interview 48 employees of an
IT company: the results confirm the participants’ willingness to migrate based on
migrationspecific factors.
        </p>
        <p>Most empirical studies carried out thus far discuss in detail the question of which
factors influence decisions to migrate. The aim of these studies is to ascertain the best
strategy for the countries involved from a migration-policy perspective, in order to control
economically motivated migratory movements. The data basis of such research is for the
most part, official statistics with the use of various methodological approaches. These studies
place an emphasis on immigrants who have completed the migration process, whereas
those remaining in their native country are not included in such studies. In the current
economic environment the international labour market situation, as described above,
requires a change in outlook: mutual mobility is desirable, especially in the case of high-tech
workers.</p>
        <p>The aim of this study is to ascertain, on the basis of information gained through
surveys, the economic and socio-political determinants of the decision to migrate. While
using variance analysis, we empirically analyse the effect of these determinants on migration
decisions by IT university students in India, just prior to the completion of their studies, as if
they would migrate to Germany or some other high-wage country.2 In addressing this
question, we test existing theories from migration research and draw conclusions for the
German case which pertain to the various decision factors.</p>
        <p>In the second section of this paper we discuss several basic theoretical
considerations from which the examined research hypotheses are derived. The survey data
and the variables of the statistical analysis are then introduced. The fourth section presents
both the descriptive findings and the test results from the variance analysis. The final section
discusses implications of the research results and provides an outlook for further planned
research.

        <title>Theoretical Considerations</title>
        <p>
          According to
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Han (2000)</xref>
          , migration is a complex process, which, as far as its emergence and
development is concerned, is continually determined through a multiplicity of causes and
factors. As a rule the causes triggering this process are a mixture of objectively compelling
exogenous factors (e.g. company contacts or attraction through foreign research laboratories
and resources) and subjectively justified decisions (e.g. good career opportunities, starting a
family). A classic approach to explaining the complex and multicausal determinants of
migration can be found in the theory of so-called push and pull factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Push factors (migration factors) comprise all those conditions of the migrants’ country
of origin that induce them to migrate or temporarily migrate, such as political or religious
persecution, economic crises and international wars. Pull factors (factors that attract
migrants) are those circumstances in the host country that motivate and encourage them to
migrate. Factors that may attract migrants are, for example, political stability, a democratic
social structure, economic prosperity, better education and wage/salary opportunities relative
to those in one’s own country. It is generally assumed that with modern information, and
communication and transportation capabilities, push and pull factors are becoming ever more
important to individual migration decisions.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Gatzweiler (1975)</xref>
          pointed out that in the end
every migration decision is the result of push factors from the source country and pull factors
from the target country working together.
        </p>
        <p>An array of approaches in the migration-theory literature aim to identify and explicate
important determining factors for an individual’s willingness to migrate or for aggregated
migration flows. The starting point of most theoretical models attempting to explain individual
migration decisions is the neo-classical approach. The majority of micro-economic models is
based on this approach, which views migration as a form of investment that is worthwhile or
2</p>
        <p>After successful completion of this pilot study, other Asian countries and/or East European
countries will be brought into the research project.
“profitable” for some individuals, but not so for others. The human capital approach maintains
that migration takes place when the cost directly incurred through it will be reimbursed or will
“pay for itself” through higher income in the future. Because of unemployment and other
economic and non-economic aspects, migration is often connected with financial and social
risks. According to neo-classical models, possible reasons for the relatively low level of
immigration from developing countries are a strong preference for one’s present
environment, high migration costs, poor labour market chances, great uncertainty and the
hope that developments in one’s native country might unexpectedly turn for the better.</p>
        <p>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">Cobb-Clark and Crossley (2001)</xref>
          state the family investment hypothesis for Australia,
which would only be empirically tenable for “traditional” families, and not for non-traditional
families in which both partners, the husband and the wife, are gainfully employed. On the
other hand, the new economy of migration challenges the central role of relative income
differences, because it views this difference as only one important point among others with
regard to the decision for or against migration.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are considerations on the macro-economic level as well, which in the end can
be traced back to a micro-economic foundation. Among these are demographic trends,
selfselection of migrants, self-sustaining migration and institutional restrictions on migration.
Demographic trends are quite important: higher population figures in the sending country
lead to per se greater migration flows. With regard to the causes of self-sustaining migration,
so-called network effects command the greatest attention. These result from the fact that,
apart from the contacts amongst themselves, migrants above all, maintain good contact with
their native country. Through this exchange of information, the information and migration
costs go down for all future migrants. People who have migrated in the past help the next
ones with assimilation in the receiving country and also help reduce psychological costs that
may arise through separation from one’s native country
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Bauer, Epstein and Gang, 2000)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>The other approach is based on political as well as economic factors and holds that
the cause is both the rapidly growing migration potential in developing countries in addition to
the limited opportunities for immigration as a result of insufficient intake ability or a lack of
receptiveness. Hence, when analysing migration flows the basic institutional conditions
should also be taken into account (Vogler and Rotte, 2000).</p>
        <p>
          Relative to the large number of theoretical approaches
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(cf. Borjas, 1994; Vogler,
1999)</xref>
          , there are few empirical findings, particularly with regard to migration from developing
countries. This is due, in part, to a lack of suitable or adequate data sets, in addition to the
fact that no extensive national or international research has been carried out up to now. As
well, there are hardly any studies available that analyse the determinants of international
migration, which take into account not only the economic and social aspects of migration but
also the political and institutional factors. Furthermore, very few of these studies deal with the
question of why migrants, despite knowledge of the incentives, stay in their native country
and do not emigrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          An empirical study by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">Marr (1975)</xref>
          analysed migratory movements from the United
States, the United Kingdom and Germany to Canada from 1950 - 1967. According to him,
relatively better working conditions and higher income played a significant role as pull factors
towards Canada. A different study by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">DeVoretz and Maki (1983)</xref>
          examined the migration of
highly qualified workers from 16 developing countries to Canada from 1968 -1973. They
found that occupation-specific employment opportunities were much more important for
wellqualified workers than earnings opportunities. In contrast, Greenwood and McDowell (1991)
gave differences in income as the most important push factor.
        </p>
        <p>
          An empirical study by Zimmermann (1994) examined asylum-related emigration from
four major regions — Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East — to the European
Union during the years 1983–1992. He found that the level of unemployment in the individual
countries had the expected negative impact on immigration, whereas the size of the
respective labour market and the level of its relative wages exerted a positive influence.
Huang (1987) chose to focus on the migration of well-educated workers from 1962–1976.
The estimates reveal the expected influence that the respective wage differentials would
have on a stay in the United States (i.e. push factor).
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Fleischer (1963)</xref>
          studied migration from
Puerto Rico to the United States and found that, here too, economic opportunities proved to
be the most significant influence for migration across national borders.
        </p>
        <p>Whereas the research discussed up to this point is based on the analysis of
crosssectional or longitudinal data, Vogler (1999) made use of a panel data set for his analysis of
migration to Germany. It covers information on migration from 86 source countries for the
period 1981–1995, including the number of asylum-seekers for the years 1984–1995.
According to Vogler’s findings, the decision of an individual to migrate from a developing
country to an industrialised nation can be interpreted as an investment. In making this
decision the potential migrant compares the future income in his or her native country with
that of the target region and also takes into consideration the costs associated with
migration. Other factors to be taken into account include unemployment, social services and
taxes, both in one’s native country and in the country of destination (i.e. push and pull
factors).</p>
        <p>
          The German Economic Institute in Cologne
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln,
2001)</xref>
          has investigated companies’ and IT specialists’ previous experiences with the German
Green Card. The study found that most of the reasons for taking up work in Germany were of
an economic nature. First and foremost, it is especially important for almost all foreign
specialists that they be given the opportunity to do “interesting work” in Germany. Foreign IT
specialists next rank the advanced vocational training offered in second place. Good career
and advancement opportunities are given as the next reasons for a stay in Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">Bartel (1989)</xref>
          studied the migration behaviour of different groups of migrants (Asians,
Europeans and Hispanics) to the United States in 1980. His research shows that the network
effects are very strong. Regions with a high number of residents belonging to a particular
ethnic group are the preferred destination of migrants of that respective group. In both their
micro-economic and macro-economic studies,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">Bauer and Zimmermann (1995)</xref>
          found a high
level of significance for network effects on migration. In a recent study Bauer, Epstein and
Gang (2000) examined the influence of a migration network on migrants’ decisions based on
location. They observed that the size of the Mexican network within the United States has a
positive effect on the likelihood of migration.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the perspective of the receiving country, there are essentially two types of
studies on the differences in income between native residents and immigrants. Studies
following the approaches of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">Chiswick (1978)</xref>
          and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Borjas (1987)</xref>
          find an initial income
disadvantage for immigrants when compared to native residents who are of the same sex,
educational level and age and who work in the same industrial sector. However, according to
their findings, the situation improves over time, and a gradual equalisation of earned income
takes place. Other studies using the traditional decomposition method to calculate
differences in income associate the unexplained remainder of differences in income between
native residents and immigrants with statistical discrimination. Recently,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Nielsen, Rosholm,
Smith and Husted (2001</xref>
          ) have attributed comparable orders of magnitude of income
differences, to a deficiency in qualifications and work experience as well as incomplete
assimilation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A good deal of the public discussion, however, revolves around the fear, not yet
empirically researched, that a German Green Card might give rise to entire waves of
immigration comparable both to the recruitment of migrants in the 1950s and 1960s and to
the consequences for the present form of the social system first and even second
generations migrants
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref15">(Fertig and Schmid, 2001)</xref>
          . The PISA Study findings for Germany point
to further pressure still surfacing with third generation immigrants. To bring more objectivity
to this discussion, we have chosen to contribute new empirical results, which were gathered
directly from a highly mobile group of IT specialists in an important potential source country.
In this way one can speak of an ascertainment of an “upper benchmark” for potential
migration from any one source country.

university graduates. This organisation’s origin was not mentioned in order to avoid a
country-specific bias in the results.
        </p>
        <p>Consistent with the survey design of this study, the university students were only
questioned about their expectations for the future relating to possible migration decisions
during this first stage of research. The students were information technology and electrical
engineering students in their final academic year of a master’s and bachelor’s programme
and, hence, possessed to the highest academic education equivalent to that of academically
trained German engineers. In order to analyse actual immigration to Germany and other
industrialised countries, we will make a second survey one year later to again interview both
the graduates who migrated and those who remained in their native country. This step will
enable us to compare their previous intentions to migrate with their actual decision.

    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>Questionnaire Design: Push and Pull Factors</title>
      <p>The questionnaire has four main sections. In the first section, the students are questioned
only about their personal characteristics. In the next section, they are only asked about
individual determinants that might influence their migration decisions. In the third section, the
students are asked to rank a number of alternative countries according to their preference. In
the final section they are to explicitly assess, taking into account both the respective country
and the importance of the various determinants, whether or not they might migrate to a
particular country.</p>
      <p>The relevant aspects to individual migration decisions are determined on the basis of
general theories on migration behaviour, empirical research results and motives for migration
already named in surveys. However, it would go beyond the scope of this project to take into
account all possible push and pull factors. For this reason the analysis has been restricted to
the most important factors, which are briefly presented below.
3.2.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Social Networks, Chain Migration</title>
      <p>
        We start with the assumption that before a person makes a decision to migrate he or she
makes a comparison of possible destinations, a task that requires relevant information about
the sending and the receiving country. This information may come from different sources,
such as various media and information agencies that deal with the systematic recruitment of
labour, and private information channels
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Feithen, 1985)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas knowledge about the determinants of the sending country is based mainly
on one’s own experiences, information about the receiving country can only be gathered
through external sources
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Gatzweiler, 1975)</xref>
        . Personal relationships to relatives and friends
are of utmost importance in obtaining such information
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Feithen, 1985)</xref>
        . The dominance of
private information channels can be explained by the fact that the weight of social and
emotional bonds can outweigh other factors when making a migration decision. Treibel
(1999) has argued that one cannot always assess reliability of such information. This
circumstance also helps explain the so-called chain migration phenomenon, which is the
larger subsequent migration flows of people who have been informed by previous migrants
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Han, 2000)</xref>
        . Networks with continuing obligations and expectations may arise through the
use of such personal relationships. The migrant networks resulting from this process help
reduce risks and uncertainties by supplying valuable information (Faist, 1997). The relatively
pronounced mobility of highly qualified workers can also be understood in this context:
Because they have a comparatively high level of information available to them as well as a
wide job-search range open to them, they often find it easier to migrate than do workers with
average skills and education

      <p>
        In principle, improvement of professional status can be grouped with the improvement of
social status as one reason for migration, because the latter usually follows from the former
as a result of an increase in income
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Feithen, 1985)</xref>
        . One push factor related to such
professional concerns is the lack of advancement opportunities in those sending countries
characterised as developing countries. In comparison, there is an opportunity to make gains
in professional and social status through migration to developed countries
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Blahusch, 1992)</xref>
        .
One pull factor is the possibility for relatively better on the job training/advanced vocational
training in industrialised countries. According to Schipulle (1973), since highly qualified
people have an especially strong desire to improve their status, it is hardly surprising that
they often name professional career planning as a motive for migration (Körner, 1999).

      <title>3.4. Salary / Income Situation and Standard of Living</title>
      <p>
        One complaint of highly qualified workers in sending countries relates to the poor wages
received. This aspect represents an important push factor (Körner, 1999), whereas higher
income in industrialised countries functions as a pull factor
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Blahusch, 1992)</xref>
        . The
comparatively low income in their countries of origin, in contrast to the high income in
industrialised countries together result in another cause of migration
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Breidenbach, 1982)</xref>
        .
According to Schipulle (1973), as a rule, the difference in income between the developing
and the industrialised country must be exceptionally large in order to induce migration. What
is more, income frequently symbolises a person’s standing and abilities and, as such,
represents a measure of his or her accomplishments and success. A high income also leads
to more respect within one’s social sphere (e.g. standard of living).

        Social distance, which can lead to hostility towards foreigners in the receiving country,
hinders migration
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Gatzweiler, 1975)</xref>
        . Through the rise of prejudices against foreigners,
xenophobia can be found time and again in alarming situations for the economy, society,
politics and culture

Koopmanns 2001)</xref>
        . Such a situation in the target country deters potential migrants, who fear
that they might come to harm during their stay abroad (Thelen, 2000).

      <title>3.6. Language/Culture</title>
      <p>Fischer and Straubhaar (1998) were the first to describe the value of immobility in a
systematic way by drawing from several new hypotheses. They argue that some skills and
part of one’s abilities are location-specific. These internal, country-specific advantages are
not just of an economic nature; rather, they are culturally, linguistically, socially and politically
binding factors. The effect of these factors and of one’s native country on migration is like
that of a “push factor” preceded by a minus sign. In addition, they deal with advantages
specific to particular businesses, regions and societies.</p>
      <p>
        When the languages of the sending and receiving countries differ, language barriers
arise, resulting in a smaller probability of migration
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Feithen, 1985)</xref>
        . Because mobility
depends considerably on an individual’s language abilities, which in a figurative sense reflect
one’s ability to integrate (Körner, 1999), highly qualified people tend to exhibit a relatively
high probability of migration because of the additional linguistic proficiencies they often
possess

      <title>3.7. Duration of Stay</title>
      <p>The permitted duration of stay in a receiving country is an important institutionally defined
determining factor. The different immigration laws of countries can work to discourage or
attract migrants. The United States, as the classic immigration country, is a good example of
a pull factor in this regard, whereas Germany, with its non-immigration policies, can be
considered a push factor. If migrants take this institutional factor into consideration in their
decision-making process, the likelihood of migration may decrease.</p>

sample of N = 1,560. In the second section of the questionnaire the participants were asked
to indicate on a scale of 1 to 6 the extent to which each of the determinants would influence
their migration decisions (1 = negligible influence/unimportant criterion; 6 = large
influence/important criterion). The six criteria were salary, language/culture, social networks,
standard of living, opportunities for self-employment and career opportunities. The
participants were first asked to judge the importance of the six criteria on their decision of
whether or not to migrate, independent of the choice of countries in question.</p>

As figure 1 clearly shows, the participants gave career opportunities the highest rating with a
result of 5.8. With a mean value of 5.6, salary is then rated as the second most important
factor. Standard of living follows in third place with a score of 5.3. As for the remaining
criteria, opportunities for self-employment was placed fourth (4.7), language/culture came in
next to last (3.9), with social networks/residence of family in last place (3.6). This last figure
reveals that decisions about migration are determined mainly through economic
considerations and the desire for greater professional and social status.

their choice. They were asked to evaluate the countries irrespective of the determinants
already given, and to rate each one on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest). A total of 1,560
cases were available for our analysis; the remaining responses could not be taken into
account because of missing information. As shown in figure 2, the respondents indicated that
their preference lay first and foremost with their native country, India, with a mean value of
4.7 — This indicates that the participants of the survey view their home country with a well
developed IT sector. The USA/Canada with a mean value of 4.6 was found to be the next
most preferred country.. In comparison with those who chose North American countries, a
lower inclination to migrate is found for those individuals who chose Great Britain (3.8) or
Australia (3.7). Finally, the participants’ rating of Germany put it into fifth place with 3.3,
before “other countries (mostly the Middle East countries)”, which came in last place.</p>

whereas another 32% do not wish to migrate at all, instead preferring to stay in India upon
completion of their studies. All the same, 11.73% of those surveyed chose Australia after the
United States/Canada, leaving Great Britain in third place among the target countries—only
around one hundred respondents (6.54%) decided for Great Britain. Germany came in
second to last place with 4.74% (73 respondents). Finally, 2.18% of the participants wished
to migrate to “other countries”.</p>

      <p>Mean value
In this sub-section we present a comparison of the mean values in order to show which of
the eight factors were viewed by the surveyed participants as decisive in their choice of a
particular host country. Table 1 provides the mean values of the eight factors for each of the
six countries. The empirical standard deviations are given in parentheses.4</p>
      <p>In the first column of table 1, one finds the mean values of the eight criteria for India.
Here, career opportunities has the highest mean value with 5.839. If one then compares the

mean values of the other countries, one discovers that career opportunities is regarded as
the second most important decision-making factor for all of the foreign countries, except their
native country, India. The second most important criterion found for the participants in India
was salary. For all other remaining countries, they viewed salary as the most important
determinant with the highest mean values. Standard of living was given third place for all
countries, and as well played an equally important role for those deciding to stay in India.</p>
      <p>For India, social networks ranked fourth place, whereas for all the other countries the
participants viewed this factor as least important (except for Great Britain). Participants
ranked opportunity for self-employment in India in fifth place and the fourth most important
criterion for all other countries considered here.</p>
      <p>Language/culture was ranked sixth for most countries except USA/Canada and other
countries. For India, duration of stay was ranked seventh by the participants, whereas it was
ranked at fifth place for Australia, Germany and Great Britain (USA and Canada at sixth
place). Surprisingly, the influence by tolerance towards foreigners was found to be the least
important factor not only for India but also for Great Britain. For all remaining countries
(Germany, USA/Canada, Australia and other countries)it was ranked equally in seventh
place.</p>
      <p>In sum, it can be said that when a decision is made to go abroad, economic reasons
(salary, career opportunities and standard of living) usually play a greater role than do
institutional or socio-political criteria. In comparison, social networks play almost as important
a role in the decision to stay in India.

      <title>Variance Analysis in Comparing Mean Values of Determinants within each Country</title>
      <p>In this sub-section we investigate whether the mean values of the eight criteria differ
significantly from one another. To this end, variance analyses were carried out for each of
the six countries5 and the results are presented in table 2. The criterion salary was selected
as the reference category. The coefficients of the remaining factors indicate the difference for
the mean value of salary (X i − X salary ) . T-values are given in parentheses for the hypothesis
that these differences are zero (H 0 : X i − X salary = 0). The F -value given in the last line of
the table tests the hypothesis that all eight mean values are equal. This can be rejected for
each of the six alternatives at the 1% level.</p>
      <p>The first column of table 2 shows the comparison of the mean values of the variable
salary with the other criteria for N = 499 individuals who chose India. The mean value for
salary is µs = 5.75; whereas it is µco = 5.84 for career opportunities. The difference for salary
is µco - µs = 0.085. With a t-value of 1.49, this difference is positive but insignificant. The
positive sign means that those students who chose India evaluated career opportunities
higher than salary.</p>
      <p>In this connection it becomes evident that career position does not have the highest
preference for the remaining countries (negative sign, also not significant). However, only for
those individuals who chose India is the difference between career opportunities and salary
not significant at the 1% level (see column 1). In all remaining countries career opportunities
was viewed significantly lower than salary.</p>
      <p>
        This result is not consistent with a qualitative study conducted by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Fiedler (2000)</xref>
        . The
interviewees cited better career prospects in their home country as important advantages
over other countries. Furthermore, the participants judged their career prospects with
German companies not so optimistically. A study by the “Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft
Köln (2001)” found that it is especially important to almost all foreign IT specialists that they
find interesting work in Germany. The questions of whether they may further join their
education at new work place and if the company will offer them good career perspectives
also played an important role.
      </p>
      <p>For those final-year students who chose Germany (column 3), the difference of
standard of living from salary is –0.825. This is significant with a t-value (–3.60) at the 5%
level. The minus sign means that these individuals rate standard of living significantly lower
(at the 5% level) than career opportunities and salary. The standard of living factor is ranked
third not only for India (see column 1 of Table 1) but also for the remaining countries.

Model of the variance analysis: Y = µ salary + ∑=2 i β i Di + ε with Y = the vector of all eight
criteria of a country option, Di = dummy for criterion i and β i = µ i − µ salary .
This finding also corresponds with a hypothesis from Schipulle (1973), which states that for
migrants, income frequently serves as an indication for the abilities of a person, that is, it
represents a measure of one’s achievements and success. A higher income leads to more
respect within one’s social sphere and/or to a higher standard of living.</p>
      <p>
        For Germany, the difference between the mean values of self-employment
opportunities and salary amounts to –1.08, and is significant at the 10% level with a t-value
of –5.28. This implies that the individuals who chose Germany evaluated possible
selfemployment lower than they did salary, career opportunities and standard of living. For all
the remaining countries, possible self-employment receives fourth place (except for India).
This finding confirms the work of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Han (2000)</xref>
        , who referred to migrants’ observations about
why they normally first venture to make the transition from salaried employee to
selfemployed entrepreneur only after waiting some years. Reasons given include low wages and
a lack of opportunities for advancement.
      </p>
      <p>Another factor which influences students’ decisions about migration, and which
should not be underestimated, is institutional regulations such as the permitted length of
stay. As table 2 shows, the difference between the mean values for duration of stay and
salary comes to –1.292 for Germany, with a t-value of –4.79 indicating significance at the 1%
level. This result shows that participants attributed less importance to duration of stay than to
salary and other criteria.</p>
      <p>
        The difference between the mean values for language/culture and salary is –1.37.
The t-value is significant at the 1% level. Those individuals who chose Germany assessed
the importance of language/culture significantly lower than they did salary. Feithen’s
hypothesis (1990) that the likelihood of migration decreases when different languages are
spoken in the sending and the receiving countries, leading to a language barrier, was not
confirmed through this analysis. With regard to the criteria language,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Janssen (1998)</xref>
        has
argued that a relatively high probability of migration predominates among highly qualified
persons. Our empirical evidence confirms this theory, for in our analysis the determinant
language/culture received a quite low ranking.
      </p>
      <p>As expected for Germany, the influence of social networks is lowest in comparison
with all other determinants (significant at the 1% level). There are only small groups of
migrants from Southeast Asia in Germany. One noteworthy result for India is that the
influence of social networks is viewed as important in comparison to salary, with the
significance of these networks ranked fourth. Otherwise, social networks receives seventh
place for Great Britain (see table 1) and last place for all other countries. For those
individuals who wished to seek employment in India, the influence of social networks is not
significantly smaller than that of salary or career opportunities. The remaining factors play a
less important role here (significant at the 1% level). In Fiedler’s study (2001), none of those
surveyed evaluated social contacts within Germany very highly. Up to now emigrants from
India to Germany have had very little opportunity to rely on long-established social networks.</p>
      <p>The factor with the least effect when reaching a decision to stay in India was,
predictably, hostility towards foreigners. On the other hand, this criterion also had the
smallest influence for Great Britain as well as for all remaining countries, including Germany,
for which it was ranked next to last. Our findings do not confirm Gatzweiler’s hypothesis
(1975) that social distance, which may lead to xenophobia within the receiving country, has a
negative impact on migration.</p>
      <p>In sum, it can be concluded that the individual criteria are evaluated at a significant
level for each respective country. For India, career opportunities and salary are considerably
more important in the decision-making process than the other criteria, whereas they are of
less importance for the remaining countries. The remaining decision-making aspects were
classified as significantly less important (negative co-efficients) for both Germany and the
other country options. According to an f- test carried out, the null hypothesis that all mean
values are equal can be rejected at the 1% level for all of the alternatives.

      <p>In this sub-section further variance analyses are carried out for each of the eight
determinants in order to ascertain whether the mean values differ to a significant degree
between the six countries.6</p>
      <p>The results of the final-year students who chose Germany have been selected as the
point of reference. The coefficients of the remaining criteria indicate the difference for the
mean value for Germany (X i − X Germany ). T -values for the hypothesis that these differences
are zero, are given in parentheses (H 0. : X i − X Germany = 0). The f- ratio given in the last line
tests the hypothesis that all six mean values are equal, that is to say, that the preference
structure (ranking of the evaluation of the determinants) of the students does not differ
significantly from each other.</p>
      <p>The first column of table 3 compares the mean values of the six alternatives for the
factor salary. The mean value for Germany is 5.23; whereas for the United States/Canada it
is 5.50. The difference comes to 0.270 with a positive but statistically insignificant t-value
(0.04).. This suggests that those who chose the United States/Canada assessed the factor,
salary, higher — by an amount of 0.270 — than those who chose Germany. In other words,
for the former group, salary is more important than it is for the latter group.</p>
      <p>This result confirms the well-known differences in income between Germany and the United
States in the IT sector. It also confirms that, when comparing locations, the participants

consider the determinant salary to be very important in reaching a decision. The positive
effect of salary in a target country on migratory movement, set out numerous times in theory
and confirmed by nearly all empirical studies to date, is found in this study as well.
Furthermore, participants who decided for Great Britain evaluated salary higher (t-value not
significant) than did those who chose Germany. Interesting is that this factor plays a very
important role for India (positive and significant co-efficient). This means that those students
who chose India evaluated salary higher than that for Germany by an amount of 0.52.
Furthermore, Breidenbach’s theory (1982), which states that the comparatively low income in
source countries and the correspondingly high income in industrialised countries together
result in one cause for migration, is not confirmed by our findings.</p>
      <p>Our analysis confirms the general assumption in Germany that the need to learn the
German language might have a negative effect on the decision to migrate to Germany. The
findings reveal that the determinant language/culture is rated considerably higher by those
who chose the United States/Canada or “other countries” (significant at the 5% level),
whereas the coefficient for Great Britain is insignificant for those who chose Germany. As
expected, Germany has the lowest mean value in this connection (3.92, ranked sixth).
What’s more, our results confirm Feithen’s hypothesis (1985) that different languages in the
sending and the receiving countries lead to a language barrier and a decreased likelihood of
migration to that country.</p>
      <p>
        The f-test for this criterion can not be rejected at a level of significance (f-test: 3.65).
Hence, the equivalence of the mean values can be ruled out to a significant degree, and the
university students have no significant preference structure for any particular country. This
situation tallies with the conclusion reached by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">Hoffmann (2001)</xref>
        and Wagener (2000) that
the German language is to some extent viewed as a fundamental problem for those
interested in the Green Card. Owing to this language barrier, Germany is to be regarded as
the second to last choice after the English-speaking countries (except USA/Canada).
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Fiedler
(2000)</xref>
        , on the other hand, comes to the conclusion that the language barrier is actually quite
modest on the whole, and suggests that the willingness to migrate is high, despite language
barriers.
      </p>
      <p>As expected, social networks was evaluated the highest by those participants who
wished to stay in their native India (t-value: 4.66 at the 1% level). Surprisingly, the positive
values of the coefficients show that network effects are evaluated as more important in the
United States/Canada, Great Britain and “other countries” than in Germany (t-values are
insignificant). Only a negative value is found for Australia. Social networks play a smaller role
for those individuals who selected Germany than they do for those who chose one of the

        In general, the considerable importance of network effects on migration has been
confirmed empirically by both micro- and macro-economic studies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(see, for example, Bauer
and Zimmermann 1995 for an overview)</xref>
        . Network effects also proved to be an important
influence on migration in a study by Vogler (1999). Furthermore,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Fiedler (2000)</xref>
        has shown
that a large share of interviewees who migrated to Germany did not receive their information
from relatives or friends, and has, therefore, concluded that there is a lack of personal
contact to people living in Germany. After India, Great Britain is ranked second to last
(ranked seventh, see table 1). Significant differences among the six alternatives can be
found for this criterion (f-value: 19.16), showing that these university students in their final
year evaluate this factor differently when comparing specific locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no significant differences between the countries with respect to tolerance
shown towards foreigners. Thus, equivalence of mean values cannot be ruled out. Only
those participants choosing Great Britain, the United States/Canada or “other countries”
rated this criterion slightly higher (plus sign, but insignificant co-efficient) than did those who
preferred Germany. Hence, the hypothesis from
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Gatzweiler (1975)</xref>
        , discussed above, is not
confirmed by our findings. As one might expect, university students remaining in India
assessed this determinant better than did those deciding for Germany. Amazingly, this
criterion shows a minus sign (statistically significant) for Australia as well. No significant
differences between the six country options can be proven for tolerance towards foreigners.
In addition, with the exception of India and Great Britain, this determinant was least important
for all options considered here (ranked last, see table 1). For Germany, Australia and USA
and Canada, it was ranked the second to last.
      </p>
      <p>The respondents who chose the United States/Canada rated the duration of a
residence permit slightly higher (t-value: 0.73) than did those who decided in favour of
Germany. With the restrictive immigration policy in effect until just recently, foreign university
students in Germany, in particular those from developing countries, were obliged to return to
their native country upon completion of their studies. These strict measures have now been
relaxed, for reasons already discussed in this paper.</p>
      <p>As expected, the duration of a residency permit for India is less important (t-value of –
1.54) than it is for Germany. The participants evaluated this factor as equally important for
Australia and the remaining countries in comparison with Germany. They did not rate the
criterion significantly higher for Great Britain and “other countries” than for Germany. With an
f-value of 5.09, the null hypothesis of equivalent mean values can be ruled out for this
determinant. Therefore, not much of a difference for this criterion can be shown for the six
country options.</p>
      <p>
        With regard to the criterion standard of living, it was evaluated as somewhat more
important by the university students who picked India and all remaining countries (t-values
positive, but insignificant). Hence, our results, to some extent, confirm Feithen’s hypothesis
(1985) that an enhanced social status results from increased income, which in turn is
achieved through improved occupational status in an industrialised country. A study by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Fiedler (2000)</xref>
        also demonstrates that the considerations of decision-makers with regard to
leaving their native country, above all, have to do with the advantage of improved financial
status. Yet the merits of better job opportunities and of a higher standard of living, which may
come through emigration and which are closely connected with financial betterment (the
former a precondition and the latter a consequence of one’s financial situation), also receive
considerable attention. According to an f-test (f-value: 2.59), equivalence of the mean values
for the criterion standard of living can be ruled out; that is, the determinant is evaluated
differently for the countries under consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the t-value (significant at 2.34), the criterion opportunities for
selfemployment is relevant for India. In comparison with the results for Germany, it is also
important for those university students who selected United States/Canada, Australia, Great
Britain or “other countries”. Students who decided in favour of these countries found the
possibility of self-employment somewhat more pertinent: (the co-efficients are positive, but
statistically insignificant). According to
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Han (2000)</xref>
        , empirical surveys show that
selfemployed migrants generate higher incomes on average, than do those in dependent
employment relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Career opportunities in India are of importance: the IT-students, who wished to remain
in their native country, found this attribute important (t-value: 2.31 at 5% level of
significance). Those who chose Australia assessed the career opportunities there higher
than they did those in Germany. The co-efficients are positive for all countries but statistically
insignificant: these individuals rated the career opportunities there higher than they did those
in Germany. This result confirms the hypothesis of Schipulle (1973) and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">Körner (1999)</xref>
        ,
which holds that highly qualified persons have a strong desire to improve their status and
often experience their own career planning as a pull factor for migration. Equivalence of the
mean values can be rejected for this criterion at a significance level of 0.000% (f-value: 4.09)
and the effects of these determinants differ significantly between the various countries.
      </p>
      <p>In sum, those individuals who chose the United States/Canada evaluated
language/culture significantly higher than those students who selected Germany. The other
criteria depict positive but statistically insignificant coefficients indicating more importance for
the North American countries than for Germany. Social networks, self-employment, career
opportunities, salary, language/culture and duration of stay are found more important for
India than for Germany. Social networks was ranked fourth by those who decided to stay in
India, in comparison with the other options. Our country comparison showed significant
differences for the criterion hostility towards foreigners; whereby the mean values for the
other alternatives differ significantly at the 1% level. Hence, the null hypothesis of equivalent
mean values can be rejected.</p>
      <sec id="sec-15-1">
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>In this study, we examined the expectations to migrate and the migration decisions among
highly qualified IT university students in India. By carrying out variance analyses, we tested
and analysed the information gained through this on-site survey, which was based on a
questionnaire designed to evaluate the economic and socio-political factors pertaining to the
students’ migration decisions.</p>
        <p>Our findings reveal, on the one hand, a relatively high willingness, in general, to
migrate to industrialised countries and on the other hand, a substantial amount of IT-students
want to stay in their home country. In the detailed questionnaire on country preferences, the
participants viewed, in addition to their home country, the North American countries (United
States and Canada) as their first choice in every respect. Germany was placed second to
last in the ranking of preferred countries, placed before other countries.</p>
        <p>A comparison of the mean values for Germany reveals that economic aspects such
as salary, career opportunities, standard of living and the possibility of self-employment are
evaluated significantly higher than other institutional or socio-political factors. Particularly
noteworthy is India’s first place ranking with regard to career opportunities, whereas this
determinant is placed second for all remaining countries.</p>
        <p>When evaluating particular factors for each respective country, economic aspects,
such as career opportunities, salary and standard of living, are very significant factors for all
countries. The remaining socio-political determinants, such as hostility towards foreigners,
duration of residence permit, language and social networks, are viewed as less important
both for Germany and the other countries considered.</p>
        <p>The individuals who chose the United States/Canada and Great Britain evaluated
language/culture significantly higher than did those students who chose Germany. There are
no significant differences between these countries and Germany with respect to the
remaining criteria (coefficients positive but insignificant).</p>
        <p>Possibilities for self-employment, career opportunities, social networks, salary and
language/culture were found to be important for India. For those who wish to stay in India,
social networks take first place compared to all others. No significant differences were
measured in our country comparison for the factor hostility towards foreigners and for the
other factors the mean values differ significantly at the 1% level. For their home country India
IT-students viewed career opportunities, salary and opportunity for self-employment, social
networks and language/culture as the most decisive factors for their migration decision.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-15-2">
        <title>Outlook and Implications</title>
        <p>In this analysis the quantification effects of the determinants or elasticities have not yet been
estimated. In future research these effects will be carried out with the help of econometric
techniques, such as discrete choice models.</p>
        <p>One conclusion to be drawn for economic policy recommendations and implications is
that salary, career opportunities, social networks and language are particularly important
aspects for locations that attract potential migrants. In order to be internationally competitive
and to attract special IT-high potentials, government authorities might also want to consider,
in connection with wage policy, whether tax breaks and incentives for the newly arriving IT
specialists, for example covering larger shares of language courses at least for the first
years, might increase Germany’s attractiveness as a location relative to other industrialised
countries. As a result of such measures, these highly qualified specialists would then have
more income available. From the current starting salary of EUR 51,000 (a condition of the
Green Card), immigrants must pay for further language courses and higher enrollment costs
when placing their children in German language schools. As is well known, highly qualified IT
specialists earn considerably more in the United States than in Germany. Hence, earned
income alone provides little incentive for the top talents to come to Germany. On the other
hand, business is expected to pay competitive wages like those in the United States, a
situation which up to now would represent a location disadvantage in Germany for small and
medium-sized businesses.</p>
        <p>Career opportunities was also named as one of the most important reasons for
migrating, but it has, as well, been found to be the most important factor for staying in India.
Quick integration of persons living here is essential, particularly for those working in
hightech industries. Prospects should be offered for career advancement in various branches of
the economy so that the best specialists are motivated to produce innovative work for
Germany and help create competitive products. Opportunities for advancement should be
facilitated in both the private sector and public administrations, and furthermore, the
transition to self-employment could be facilitated for these groups of applicants.</p>
        <p>The university students who selected the United States/Canada said that they
consider a permanent visa as an important factor in their decision to migrate. For those IT
specialists who have already arrived in Germany through the Green Card scheme, this
institutional barrier — that is, the five-year restriction currently in effect or recently introduced
— should be eased for reasons of competitiveness and integration. With the possibility of an
indefinite stay, immigrants in Germany will have a more long-term perspective and higher
chances of integration. It would then also be possible to build up social networks. In addition,
naturalisation could be made easier for foreigners, who have special knowledge and skills
and already live in Germany, in order to ensure better integration.</p>
        <p>Language and cultural barriers for new immigrants could be reduced by offering
supplementary language courses at universities or Goethe-Institutes in the respective source
countries. In this way, the migrants could acquire basic language skills early on and bring this
knowledge along, thereby facilitating quick integration.</p>
        <p>Although hostility towards foreigners was not found to be a significant factor, detailed
information on the “Green Card” immigrants should be provided to native residents. This
information should clearly explain to the public the predominantly economic reasons for the
employment of IT specialists, and thereby also making the advantages of immigration more
evident to native residents.</p>
