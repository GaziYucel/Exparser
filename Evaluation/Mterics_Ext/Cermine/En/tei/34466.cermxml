Labor and Global Justice: Emerging Reform Coalitions in the
World’s Only Superpower**
This paper examines rejuvenated labor, environmental and campus movements in the U.S.,
in case studies of living wage, anti-sweatshop, sustainable development and Justice for
Janitors campaigns. The cases offer surprising evidence for the resurgence of progressive
activism in America, at a critical historical juncture in which contrasting perspectives contend for
prominence – Washington consensus versus Seattle coalition, employer-driven
deunionization versus union-led mobilization, corporate power and corruption versus
laborinclusive social movement upsurge, and in the global arena, unilateral domination versus
multilateral negotiation. Predominantly local, the coalitions examined in this research, taken
together across the United States, amount to a substantial movement for broad economic
and social policy reform, an American movement with potentially global ramifications. The
argument presented here contends that this revitalization of social forces in the U.S. is
significant enough to need explanation, and presents evidence pointing toward key causal
forces at work: chronic inequality, strategic leadership, and coalition building.</p>

      <title>Neue Reformkoalitionen in der einzigen Supermacht der Welt</title>
      <p>Thema dieses Beitrags sind neu erstarkte Arbeiter-, Umwelt- und Studentenbewegungen in den
USA, die in Fallstudien über deren Kampagnen (Lebensstandard, Anti-Sweatshop, nachhaltige
Entwicklung und Justice for Janitors) untersucht werden. Die Fallbeispiele dokumentieren
überraschende Evidenzen für die Wiederbelebung eines progressiven Aktivismus in Amerika an einer
kritischen Wegscheide mit konstrastierenden Perspektiven – Washington-Konsensus versus
Seattle-Koalition, kapitalgesteuerte Antigewerkschaftskampagnen versus gewerkschaftliche
Mobilisierung, unternehmerische Macht und Korruption versus Arbeiter- und soziale
Bewegung, und in der globalen Arena: unilaterale Dominanz versus multilaterale Aushandlung.
Wenn die in diesem Beitrag beschriebenen Koalitionen auch vorwiegend lokalen Charakter
haben, stellen sie doch, zählt man sie zusammen, eine substanzielle Bewegung für breite
ökonomische und soziapolitische Reformen dar, eine amerikanische Bewegung mit globalen
Verzweigungen. Vertreten wird das Argument, dass die Revitalisierung der sozialen Kräfte in den
USA bedeutsam genug ist, um nach einer Erklärung zu verlangen, und dass die Evidenzen auf
die Kausalität zentraler Kräfte verweisen: auf chronische Ungleichheit, strategische
Führerschaft und Koalitionsbildung.</p>

Since the Reagan/Thatcher era, there has been an air of inevitability about the growth
of corporate power, the decline of labor unions, and the expansion of global
capitalism. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union deepened
the sense of irreversible market triumph. The only remaining superpower has led the
charge toward an increasingly deregulated, “unleashed” global economy.</p>
      <p>
        Yet both organized and theoretical opposition to the dominant global vision are
growing. In recent years an alternative vision has begun to take shape and to gain in
political viability. The “Battle of Seattle” in late 1999 and subsequent mass
demonstrations through 2002 in Prague, Quebec, Genoa, Porto Alegre and Barcelona, followed
by massive world-wide antiwar demonstrations on February 15, 2003, have given
voice to the opposition. Insiders such as Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">Stiglitz (2002)</xref>
        , former chief economist at the World Bank, have deepened their
criticism of the IMF model and Washington consensus. A corporate corruption epidemic
in 2002 undermined the legitimacy of unregulated markets and corporate power.
      </p>
      <p>The focus of this study1 is on the labor proponents of an emerging alternate
vision. The focus, in other words, is on the actors rather than what they are fighting for,
since the reform vision is only beginning to take shape and will mean nothing without
the actors (such as unions) who promote, negotiate, revise, campaign for and
implement the new ideas and policies.</p>
      <p>If the dominant vision can be called market globalism, the emerging alternative
points toward a more democratic globalism. After a broad overview to highlight core
debates, this paper focuses on key U.S. unions and their coalitions, opposing the
dominance of currently configured global capitalism – for the most part in battles at the
local level – while gradually developing an alternative view. In the U.S., the relevant
social actors include most prominently revitalized labor, environmental, student and
antiwar movements, in coalition with each other and a variety of other community,
religious, civil rights and political groups.</p>
      <p>
        This coalition-based research assumes that global reform conflicts will take shape
not as North-South, rich-poor, business-labor or even Empire-multitudes
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Hardt and
Negri 2000)</xref>
        , but rather in wide-ranging, shifting coalitions of a multiplicity of actors –
including national governments and international agencies as well as domestic and
international labor, business and other NGO’s. The focus here on labor as a social force
inside the United States also assumes that reformist movements inside the one
remaining superpower are essential for the prospects of expanded global democracy.2

        This is not meant to devalue the role of domestic and international labor coalitions
elsewhere throughout the global North and South. Many unions in the U.S., in fact, are
increasingly aware of the urgent need for cross-national and global coalitions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref37">(Gordon and
Turner 2000; Nissen 2002)</xref>
        . But the primary focus here is on labor-led domestic coalition
building in the U.S., in the context of an increasingly global economy.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Explaining growing opposition</title>
      <p>Greatly simplified, the central conflict within the global North finds multinational
corporations and the U.S. government (and some of its allies) on one side, promoting
market globalism, backed by and working with existing national and global
institutions, with groupings of organized interests, social movements and other NGO’s on
the other side, beginning to mobilize for reform. The argument examined in this paper
explains the growing significance of reform forces with reference to three variables: vast
domestic and global inequality (highlighted by recent corporate scandals); new leadership with a
broadened strategic vision at key activist groups, including the AFL-CIO and several of its
leading unions; and a growing, contagious focus among activist groups on coalition
building.</p>
      <p>While these variables may best explain the current upsurge of opposition to
market (or corporate) globalism, they are together not enough to produce substantial
democratic reform in the global economy. Also required for successful reform, evidence
considered here suggests, are both an expanded capacity for grassroots mobilization
(relying on the “people power” that affords comparative advantage to these reform
groups) and a new political opportunity structure. The latter depends upon divisions among
established powers, including multinational corporations and rich country
governments. Corporate scandals that disinherit employees and investors, the European push
toward a “social Europe,” trade conflicts among governments, intense differences
over war in Iraq, and conflicts between governments and WTO, IMF, World Bank
and other international agencies all offer potential openings in the political
opportunity structure.</p>
      <p>Economic circumstances (such as inequality) and political opportunity structures
(including corporate scandals) are thus significant in shaping the prospects for a viable
opposition to the dominant market globalism. The focus of this research is
nonetheless on strategic actors and their coalitions for reform. Unlike much social science
analysis that emphasizes constraints, barriers and (often insurmountable) problems,
the actor-based theoretical approach offered here emphasizes possibilities and
potential breakthroughs. While we certainly need to understand the depths of the challenges
facing democratic reform efforts in the contemporary global economy – and research
that explores the challenges and barriers is indispensable – revitalization research is
also essential in pointing toward opportunities for reform.</p>
      <p>After the presentation of core concepts and case study research, a brief
reconsideration of the literature highlights the potential contributions of an actor-based
revitalization approach that focuses less on problem constellations than on efforts aimed
at overcoming the problems.</p>

    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>Contending visions of a global economy</title>
      <p>In the wake of the cold war, as we build – or fail to build – a new world order, two
core debates have emerged. The first is between those who favor and those who
oppose the development of a global economy and society. Thomas Friedman has called
this the debate over whether to globalize.3 In the chart below, the forces listed under
Fighting the Global Economy, alone or in various combinations, seek to counter and
oppose the modern push toward globalization. In so doing, these forces campaign
primarily against the existing dominant market globalism, yet they also undermine the
potential foundations of democratic globalism.</p>
      <p>The second core debate is between what is here called market and democratic
globalism. Friedman refers to a debate over how to globalize. In various ways, the
constituents of these two contending camps promote a global economy and to some
extent a global society as well. Against the nationalists, localists and fundamentalists of
all stripes, these are the internationalists of our era.</p>

      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Market globalism</title>
      <p>Market globalism is the dominant force shaping today’s world economy.4 The emphasis
is on free markets. Multinational corporations, backed by the rich country
governments in which they are based, are the primary economic and political actors shaping
this global order. We used to say “what’s good for GM is good for America” (or at
least that was what the widely quoted president of GM said). Now it’s more like
“what’s good for capital is good for the global economy”: trickle-down economics
writ large. The World Trade Organization and the G-7 heads of states actively and
centrally promote the interests of business – in the belief that what is good for
international business is good for us all.</p>
      <p>In the context of existing global institutions and architecture, this model aims to
maximize opportunities for business by expanding free trade, deregulation, and capital
flows while minimizing business risk. Property rights and investment protections in
trade agreements are important, but not labor or environmental standards that raise
costs and cut down on business discretion (and thus investment, jobs and general
prosperity in this trickle-down worldview). While the primary locus of economic and
political power lies in the global North, the governments and large businesses of many
developing countries are also party to the dominant global order. From “crony
capitalism” to labor-repressive domestic policies and acceptance of the IMF model, many
(but not all) governments of the South help sustain market globalism while blocking
democratic reform both at home and in the global economy.</p>
      <p>
        Contemporary negotiations at the G-7, WTO, IMF and World Bank aim to
deepen market globalism as an engine of prosperity and development. Markets are
powerful instruments that can and often do promote an efficient allocation of
resources and economic growth. But free markets typically also produce great
inequalities and environmental “externalities.” Growing social and economic polarization in
the United States is one example; by contrast, inequality is tempered in Europe by
stronger social policy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Hutton 2002)</xref>
        . Most serious is the growing divide between rich
and poor countries, referred to by Bruce
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">Scott (2001)</xref>
        as “the great divide in the global
village.” A widespread concern here is that even if we don’t care about the injustice of
inequality, we will quite simply never be safe from terrorists, revolutionaries and other
anti-system forces in a vastly unequal world

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>Democratic globalism</title>
      <p>In response to such concerns, democratic globalism has emerged in recent years as a
powerful yet still largely unformed alternative vision and force.5 Most participants at the
Seattle demonstrations would I believe fall under this heading. American labor unions,
for example, have in many (but not all) cases moved beyond national protectionism to

        Alternative labels could include free market globalism, liberal globalism, global neoliberalism,

advocate basic labor and socials standards in trade agreements and to demand a seat
for labor at the WTO and other corporate-dominated bodies shaping global economic
relations. Environmental groups mobilizing for Seattle and subsequent efforts
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref21 ref26 ref43 ref56">(including the annual World Social Forum in Porto Alegre and the 2002 Johannesburg Earth
Summit)</xref>
        have moved beyond species or wilderness protection to build coalitions with
labor and community groups for sustainable jobs and earth-friendly development.
Human rights groups, debt relief advocates, religious organizations, consumer groups
and many more have mobilized in new coalitions, local, national and global, to
advance human and environmental interests in a changing world economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among such a wide variety of international, national and local groupings, there
are to be sure substantially diverging interests. Some World Social Forum leaders are
in fact more anti-globalist than reformist. Policy proposals in areas such as
immigration and debt relief are highly contested within reform circles. Conflicts among
environmental and poverty activists are commonplace and chronic. Overcoming such
contradictions is an ongoing challenge for today’s activist coalition builders, from the
local level on up
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">(Rose 2000)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>While such groups and coalitions are still emerging, still working out points of
unity and disagreement, there is a common thread: a growing call for voice, for
democratic input, for the concerns of workers, citizens and the environment to be heard
in economic and political decision-making processes. The press typically labels the
protestors “anti-globalization.” Some of them are, including many of the most visible
and violent (the ones the press itself loves to glorify). Understanding that we live in an
increasingly global society, however, most of these activist groups aim to expand
democratic voice at all the levels where it is now essential: local, national, regional and
global. The democratic globalist vision, in its developing essence, aims to preserve and
expand democratic voice where it now exists at national and local levels, and to build a
new global social dimension so that globalization does not overwhelm local and
national democracy.</p>
      <p>
        Democratic globalism is not for the most part a revolutionary force. On the
contrary, it is overwhelmingly reformist, seeking to reform existing market globalism to
make it more democratic, more just and green. Just as the brutalities of early
capitalism called forth both reformist and revolutionary opposition, so the brutalities of
global capitalism call forth many types of opposition. In the rich countries at least, and
to a large extent in developing countries as well, the dominant call of the opposition is
not for overthrow of the system but for inclusion. This could change if inclusion is
denied, as the powers-that-be are often warned – from the outside by vast
demonstrations and from the inside by analysts such as Ethan
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Kapstein (1996)</xref>
        , George
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">Soros
(2002)</xref>
        and Joseph
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">Stiglitz (2002)</xref>
        . A new focus at Nike and other companies on
“corporate social responsibility” and codes of conduct as well as the World Bank’s new
sensitivity to political realities in developing countries can all be understood as
responses to (and attempts to co-opt) mounting pressures for reform.6

      </p>
      <p>See for example Michael Skapinker, “Why Nike has broken into a sweat.” Financial
Times, FT.com, March 6, 2002.</p>
      <p>Exclusion combined with deprivation can transform reformist into revolutionary
forces, creating a fertile seedbed for extraordinary evils such as ethnic cleansing and
terrorism. In short, the alternatives to a reformist democratic globalism are not pretty.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>Forces of reaction</title>
      <p>Forces opposing the global economy vary across a wide range of strategies and
worldviews. What they have in common, in addition to an opposition to globalization, is a
tendency to look backward in time. Earlier romantics looked to a state of nature or an
idyllic medieval village – one that may never have existed but has been nicely recreated
for mass consumption at today’s Renaissance Faire. Anti-globalizers look back to the
glory and security of the nation-state, the vitality of the local community, the sanctity
of religious purity or the certainty of past ideologies. While the visions may be
compelling and may even attract mass followings, each is in fundamental ways impossibly
discordant with the modern world.</p>
      <p>Nationalism puts the interests of the nation-state above all else. Historically, this
force is associated with the nation-building of the 19th and 20th centuries and has
brought many gains, from national defense and prosperity to the welfare state. On the
downside, nationalism produces intolerance, narrow-mindedness and war. In the
global economy, nationalist sentiment can choke off world trade and global solutions
to common problems. A contemporary example of shortsighted nationalism lies in the
American decision in 2001 to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, a far-reaching
international agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions and global warming, on the
grounds that this might hurt the American economy.</p>
      <p>
        Localism offers a beautiful alternative vision based on the vitality, environment
and interpersonal connections of local place and community
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref32">(Mander and Goldsmith
1996)</xref>
        . Again, however, the task is to integrate communities, along with regional and
national economies, in a constructive way within the broader world economy.
Localism that takes the form of anti-government anarchism is a utopian dead-end – or
worse when it takes shape as window-smashing black shirts at otherwise non-violent
mass demonstrations.
      </p>
      <p>If Hitler and the Holocaust were products of a vile, extreme nationalism, the
terrorist attacks of September 11 were products of an extreme and intolerant religious
fundamentalism. While most religious fundamentalists are non-violent and many withdraw
to a large extent from the modern world, uncompromising religious belief can
motivate all kinds of horrors. Historically, wars and massacres in the name of religion have
been particularly bloody, and in our time the targets have ranged from doctors
performing abortions to ethnic cleansing in the Balkans to the attack on innocent
civilians at the World Trade Center. Religious fundamentalists look backward in time to
early religious communities and saviors and forward in time to some promised land
beyond the earth. Squeezed between these idealized points of reference, an
increasingly global society, especially a commercial, secular one, appears alien and often
threatening to core fundamentalist values.</p>
      <p>Communism offered an alternative global vision, one that failed long before the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Today’s communists, in places such as China and Cuba
(along with significant reformed communist – now largely social-democratic – unions
and parties throughout eastern and western Europe), hardly offer much threat to the
new global order. China, the one large bastion where a communist government rules,
has largely abandoned any kind of Marxist economic vision in favor of the dynamism
of markets – with great economic success – and has now joined the WTO.</p>
      <p>Neo-naziism is an extreme one-dimensional form of nationalism, based on racial or
ethnic superiority. This is also largely a failed vision of the past, with ugly present
echoes in “skinhead” attacks on foreign workers in Germany, in anti-immigrant
propaganda in France and many other societies, and in outrages like the Oklahoma City
federal building bombing. With little mass following anywhere, thoroughly discredited in
the wake of World War II, such ideologies have only minimal bearing on global
debates yet continue to persist as dangerous, backward looking fringe forces in modern
societies.</p>
      <p>None of the five forces fighting the global economy offer realistic solutions to
contemporary problems. All look backward in time rather than forward. While
communism and neo-naziism offer only failed and seriously flawed visions of the past,
nationalism and localism each offer one important building block as long as neither is
reified into the sole solution. Where religious fundamentalism is non-violent, it offers
a test of the capacity of modern secular societies for wide-ranging religious tolerance
and freedom. A broadly acceptable global vision will surely exclude neo-naziism and
terrorism while accepting reformed communism and religious freedom and building
upon local vitality and the still important nation-state.</p>

      <title>Forces for reform: Labor, environmental and campus activism</title>
      <p>At the dawning of a new millennium, perhaps anything is possible. How many of us
dreamed in our darkest nights of passenger planes exploding into mammoth high-rise
buildings? The unspeakable proved all too possible.</p>
      <p>Yet there were also signs of wonder and hope at the turning of the millennium.
On November 30, 1999, sea turtles rose up on two legs and marched through the
streets of Seattle. They challenged the World Trade Organization and joined with
workers and students to protest corporate dominance of the global economy.
Together they planted seeds of democratic globalism. The emerging vision persists, now
offering a way beyond the horrors of September 11 and the injustice of growing
inequality and massive corporate corruption.</p>
      <p>What American actors can promote and advocate the deepening of democracy at
local, national and global levels? As always in such periods, multiple movements are
present, feeding off each other, overlapping, in conflict and in coalition. As unions
move toward new tactics of rank-and-file mobilization and broad coalition building,
the labor movement is a central presence in the current upsurge, and indeed the core
issue is economic and social polarization – in both American and global society. The
environmental movement, building on three decades of progress, swells in fits and starts as
the earth’s limits become increasingly clear and as former opponents such as unions
come around. “Blue-green” (labor-environmental) alliances spread, from college
campuses where green and sweatshop activists intermingle to local coalitions for
sustainable jobs and national campaigns against fast track and the Free Trade Area of the
Americas. After decades of quiescence, campus activism is on the rise, around labor,
environmental and a variety of other issues. In addition, human rights, civil rights, the
women’s movement, consumer protection, international solidarity, the peace and debt
relief movements, community organizing around local issues – all play a role in today’s
resurgent progressive coalitions. And building on all of these is the more recent and
potentially massive antiwar movement (led by groups such as MoveOn.org, ANSWER,
ATTAC, and USLAW – U.S. Labor against the War).</p>
      <p>There is also a blending of generations in these campaigns for reform and
expanded democracy. Many of today’s labor, environmental and antiwar leaders are
themselves former activists of the sixties. Idealistic, informed by lifelong social values,
they are now highly skilled organizers and competent administrators as well. Yet the
driving energy comes from a new generation, in their late teens and twenties, campus,
community and workplace activists, coming of age in a churning social environment
that kindles activist passion. From Students Against Sweatshops to “union kids” on
the front lines of organizing drives, from green-haired sea turtles in Seattle to
highschool demonstrators against war in Iraq, the next generation of activists has arrived.</p>
      <p>
        When social movements subside (as they always do), they leave behind networks
and communities of activists who defend the gains and carry on the campaigns,
especially at the grassroots level. This is a phenomenon well known to social movement
theorists, and this is exactly what happened in the 1970s and 1980s
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54 ref57">(Staggenborg
1998; Tarrow 1994)</xref>
        . In the absence of powerful social forces on their side – quite the
contrary in the Reagan era – veteran activists from the 1960s did more than bide their
time. Some spread environmental consciousness and green politics (with a perfect
target in the environmental policies of Interior Secretary James Watt), while others
developed through experimentation labor’s new “organizing model.” They have
fought through the system into positions of leadership and responsibility. Most
importantly, they have kept the flame burning for a new activist generation.

      <title>The evidence: Coalition building</title>
      <p>This paper is intended more as a provocative research design than as the presentation
of a fully formed argument. The resurgence of labor, environmental and campus
activism is demonstrated here in case studies of coalition building that together indicate the
growing salience of contemporary reform movements. While labor is at the center of
this analysis, environmental, campus, antiwar and other movements – and especially
the growing linkages among them – are as essential for the prospects of national and
global reform.</p>
      <p>
        After 40 years of declining business unionism, the American labor movement
announced at least the possibility of revitalization in its impressive coalition-building
efforts for the Seattle demonstrations of 1999. Campaigns with environmentalists in
battles against NAFTA (1993) and fast track (1997-98) inspired a broad Alliance for
Sustainable Jobs and the Environment
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45 ref51">(Shoch 2001; Rose 2000)</xref>
        , that itself laid the
groundwork for the demonstrations in Seattle against the policies of the WTO.
Empowered by the broad nature of this global justice coalition, activists fanned out into
growing and often successful local coalition efforts aimed at a broad range of issues,
from living wage and anti-sweatshop to peace and sustainable economic development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The building of active coalitions – most of them at the local level – has been a
central component of the revitalization of the American labor movement since the
early 1990s. The Seattle coalition, which brought together 30,000 demonstrators
organized by labor groups with 20,000 from environmental, religious, human rights and
other groups to protest World Trade Organization policies, was only the most
dramatic manifestation of the growing coalition phenomenon
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Hawken 2000)</xref>
        . Since the
plant-closing coalitions of the 1980s, accelerating since the mid-1990s, key unions
have moved beyond traditional bases, in some cases to build enduring alliances with
human rights, environmental, religious, student, feminist, and other community
groups. In response (and perhaps wisely from a political perspective), the Bush
administration has attempted to break apart such coalitions, signing up several unions,
for example, to support the campaign for Arctic oil drilling. The continuing
revitalization of the American labor movement may well depend on the success or failure of
labor in redefining itself as a broad partisan force, in lasting national and local
coalitions with a broad range of social groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of a broader picture of revitalization, coalitions have increased in
importance for particular activist unions, especially for those with a strong commitment to
organizing (including, for example, SEIU, HERE, CWA and UNITE). Labor-backed
coalitions cover a wide variety of local concerns, in addition to national alliances with
environmental (and other) groups around issues such as fair trade
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">(Rose 2000)</xref>
        . At the
same time, the environmental movement has developed an increasingly significant
“environmental justice” dimension, opening the door to expanded social coalitions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">(Shabecoff 2000)</xref>
        . And a new generation of student activists has built reform
coalitions extending across campus, into the community and even into national and global
politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paradox for advocates of democratic globalism is that most of these coalition
efforts are local. Building on local groups, issues and leaders, such coalitions
nonetheless reflect the economic and social realities of a global economy. Local activists, to be
sure, may not “think globally” at all, even as their campaigns serve as carriers of a
broader reform vision.7 But just as local coalitions laid the groundwork for the
massive Seattle demonstrations, such groupings increasingly and inevitably are drawn into
global issues and debates – from immigration and corporate accountability to
investment, skills training and tax policy. And some of the most promising
coalitionbuilding cases take place in so-called “global cities,” where concentrations of global
capital collide with growing low-end service (and often largely immigrant) workforces

from within the superpower for economic, social and environmental policy reform.

      <p>
        While most national unions (led by the AFL-CIO) sat out the social movements of the
1960s, local unions here and there, in cities such as San Francisco, Seattle and New
York, did participate in antiwar and civil rights coalitions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">(Turner 2003)</xref>
        . As those
movements declined in the 1970s, labor’s limited participation also declined; and not
coincidentally labor’s isolation deepened and membership density dropped in the face
of growing employer opposition. In response to deep recession and plant closings in
the 1980s, labor-community coalitions finally emerged in defensive campaigns to save
factories and jobs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Brecher and Costello 1990)</xref>
        . On that foundation, a new wave of
labor-backed coalition efforts, some strategic and enduring, emerged in the 1990s across
a range of issues. Of particular recent interest are the following examples of strategic
coalition building, presented here as partial findings from ongoing research.8
      </p>
      <p>
        Journalist Robert Kuttner has described the living wage movement as “the most
interesting (and under-reported) grassroots enterprise to emerge since the civil rights
movement”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42 ref47">(quoted in Pollin and Luce 1998, p.1)</xref>
        . In cities large and small across the
country, coalitions of activists, often labor-led, campaign for local minimum wages (at
least for government-contracted or subsidized work) considerably higher than the
national minimum wage, with notable cases of success. Examples include the
Community Labor Alliance in Connecticut
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(with living wage laws passed in New Haven in
1997 and Hartford in 1999)</xref>

        . In most cases, successful coalitions are led by local unions with active national
union support, with networks of overlapping activists in long-term regularized
relationships among a variety of community-based groups, including social movements,
churches and political organizations. Broad success for the living wage movement is
indicated in the spread of new legislation: over 70 American cities had passed living
wage laws by 2002

hold on American campuses after the first Union Summer in 1996. A project of the
new Sweeney-led AFL-CIO, Union Summer placed hundreds of young people in
summer internships in organizing and collective bargaining campaigns, encouraging
them to build centers of labor activism on their return to the workplace or college
campus. Inspired by these returning activists, the anti-sweatshop movement grew
rapidly and dramatically, with successful sit-ins at universities as diverse as Duke, Brown,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Penn, Arizona, Georgetown and North Carolina. While UNITE
and Union Summer helped to launch the movement and UNITE has underwritten the
costs of USAS national meetings, case study interviews indicate that campus-based
coalitions are significantly autonomous. Supporting each other when possible,
working together loosely in USAS, activists have built distinct local coalitions with a variety
of campus, religious, community groups and local unions. Critical components of
success in the growth and development of the campus anti-sweatshop movement appear
to include: national union support (especially at the beginning, for resources and
education, and for continuing USAS conference funding); the building of lasting local
organizations (SAS and related coalitions); and the capacity to mobilize thousands of
students for demonstrations, sit-ins and other activities.</p>
      <p>
        In some ways the most problematic yet at the same time most promising
coalitions are sustainability alliances, with labor and environmental groups at the core
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref45">(Moberg 1999; Rose 2000)</xref>
        . When these two groups – often adversaries in the past – work
together, the potential for both national political influence and local mobilization is
great. Recent research shows that in spite of stereotypes, relations between labor and
environmental groups are on the whole quite positive
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">(Obach 1999)</xref>
        . Today there are
scores of such coalitions working together on a wide variety of issues, from living
wage and anti-sweatshop campaigns to toxic waste sites, workplace health and safety,
clean air and global warming. A recent potentially path-breaking example is the Apollo
Project, advocating a 10-year $300 billion research plan to promote hybrid and
hydrogen cars and clean energy factories and appliances, thereby promoting manufacturing
and construction jobs in the U.S. and at the same time fighting environmental
pollution – in a coalition effort backed by key unions (UAW, USW, IAM, UMW, IBEW,
SEIU) as well as environmental groups such as the Sierra Club.10

      <p>
        While local coalitions predominate and are generally quite autonomous, they
typically receive important support from national labor and environmental organizations
and sometimes as well from national umbrella groupings such as the Alliance for
Sustainable Jobs and the Environment. The Alliance formed in the losing fight against
NAFTA in 1993, regrouped to defeat fast-track legislation in 1997

Local coalition efforts continue to thrive in dozens of cities and regions.</p>
      <p>
        Observing that labor-environmental coalitions are often “cross-class alliances,”
Fred Rose emphasizes the role of bridge builders – those who have been upwardly or
downwardly mobile or have social movement histories that push them across the
divide
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">(Rose 2000)</xref>
        .11 Also typically present in the building of labor-environmental
coalitions are strong support from national organizations, overlapping networks of activists
in the different organizations, and an ongoing history of common effort leading to
processes of alliance institutionalization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Closely related to living wage and anti-sweatshop campaigns are union-initiated
coalitions conceived in support of labor campaigns that develop long-term strategic
potential. One example is SEIU’s Justice for Janitors, essentially a national effort to
reorganize urban building services after a period of de-unionization. Faced with the loss of
members as building owners eliminated jobs and turned to janitorial service
contractors in the 1980s, SEIU developed a combined organizing, bargaining and civil rights
strategy based on the corporate campaign model with special attention to building
coalitions in specific communities. This has been a national effort based on the
mobilization of local union activists in coalition with local churches, community
organizations, and labor-friendly elected officials. In some cities the coalitions have been
temporary or sporadic, but in other cities they have endured. Perhaps the best example is
Los Angeles where thousands of largely Hispanic janitors have been organized and
won major contract improvements in a series of successive campaigns from the early
1990s through a dramatic strike victory in 2000, each campaign building a broader and
deeper level of community support

        .12
      </p>
      <p>In spite of these promising examples, the reality is that most American unions
continue to think about coalitions in more narrow, defensive terms. This is true even
where unions have relied on comprehensive campaigns as a source of leverage during
contract negotiations and organizing drives. Outreach to potential allies for support in
pressuring employers tends to be on union terms, and typically dissolves when the
campaign ends. Although such outreach may help in the effort to reconstruct labor as
a broad partisan force, sustainable momentum requires more lasting relationships.</p>
      <p>Increasingly indispensable for organizing, political action and international
solidarity, coalition building is critical to the current revitalization of the American labor
movement. Moving beyond the “special interest group” mentality of business union
traditions, coalition-building unions seek to broaden community bases while
expanding political influence.

      <title>The argument summarized</title>
      <p>For the cases presented above and many more, progressive coalitions including labor
have developed and deepened across the United States over the past decade. In cities
such as Los Angeles, the result has been the wholesale transformation of local
politics.13 Coalition case studies offer preliminary but important evidence pointing toward
key causal factors at work in the emergence of contemporary forces for political,
economic and social reform.</p>
      <p>Expanded coalition building among revitalized activist groups appears to be a driving
force and necessary condition for the growing significance of reform forces and their
budding alternative vision (itself local and national as well as global). While the other
two necessary conditions, inequality and strategic leadership, cannot be fully
developed here, their importance is demonstrated in processes of labor-led coalition
building, presented above and summarized as follows.</p>
      <p>Growing inequality is clearly an important underlying economic condition pushing
labor toward coalitions such as living wage, anti-sweatshop and Justice for Janitors.
Economic and social polarization, seen for example in the decay of inner cities, has
also inspired the emergence within the environmental movement of a new focus on
environmental justice, opening the possibility of broadened coalition efforts with
labor, human rights, religious and community groups. And contemporary campus
issues, from USAS to solidarity with university workers and their collective bargaining
campaigns, are in many cases driven by a passionate outrage at the massive inequalities
of global, national and local economies. Corporate corruption scandals have only
magnified the awareness and readiness for protest action, especially of an increasingly
activist young generation.</p>
      <p>
        Strategic leadership appears to be the third necessary condition for the growing
significance of contemporary reform forces. Most obviously, the election of an insurgent
slate at the AFL-CIO in 1995 has expanded the strategic vision of a considerable
“vanguard” (if still a minority) of American unions, shifting emphasis toward
organizing and rank-and-file mobilization and encouraging progressive coalition building
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref59">(Bronfenbrenner et al. 1998; Turner, Katz and Hurd 2001)</xref>
        . In a parallel development,
the movement for environmental justice has transformed the thinking of key
environmental leaders, moving the focus beyond wilderness preservation to urban
revitalization and sustainable development coalitions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45 ref50">(Rose 2000; Shabecoff 2000)</xref>
        . On
American college campuses, a new generation of activist leadership has emerged, with
an expansive view of coalition building and reform possibilities.14 Strategic leadership

      <p>
        This is particularly striking for a native Angeleno returning to visit. The Los Angeles I
grew up in was largely Republican and non-union. L.A. today has a plausible claim as one
of the country’s strongest union towns, and the latest mayoral runoff election (2001) was
between two pro-labor Democrats. The transformation has been driven by the expansion
of the Hispanic community and its political and economic mobilization, along with the
coalition building of a revitalized local labor movement
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Milkman 2002)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>The most visible national manifestation of new strategic campus leadership has been the
founding of United Students Against Sweatshops, referred to by one student activist
inappears to be important both at high levels of organizations – John Sweeney and
David Brower, for example, each played key roles in bringing together the Alliance for
Sustainable Jobs and the Environment and the subsequent Seattle coalition – and at
local levels, where bridge builders with cross-movement experiences or perspectives
are especially important.15</p>
      <p>
        In addition to coalition building, inequality and strategic leadership, two more
factors appear to matter in explaining the growing strength of reform forces. One is
the political opportunity structure. Clearly, corporate scandals open the door for reform
efforts. Yet the breadth of successful living wage and anti-sweatshop campaigns in a
great variety of American cities and universities
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref43">(pre-dating the corporate corruption
epidemic of 2002)</xref>
        suggests that other factors – strategic leadership, coalition building,
chronic inequality – may be more important, something for future research to
consider. The other significant factor is grassroots mobilization, present to a significant extent
in all of our successful coalition campaign cases. How and why such mobilization,
participatory politics at its best, becomes possible is also a question for future research. Is
mobilization a causal factor in itself, making everything else possible, or is
mobilization a sort of “natural force” that occurs spontaneously when the door is opened (and
when other factors such as inequality, strategic leadership and coalition building are in
place)?

contrasting analyses of labor.</p>
      <p>
        Postwar industrial relations analysis in the U.S. operated within a dominant
American-centered, pluralist perspective, assuming a stable social system and well
functioning sub-systems such as industrial relations, with a focus on institutions and
the details and effects of policies such as collective bargaining

        . The mutual recognition of the two major actors, business and labor,
ensured stability of the industrial relations system. According to this perspective, mutual
recognition was itself the consequence of the withering away of class conflict across
the advanced world and its substitution with the joint search for technocratic
solutions to the problems of industrialism

        In the meantime, social and economic stability in North America and western
Europe came undone with the war in Vietnam and the social movements of the 1960s
and early 1970s. A new literature appeared, seeking to understand and explain the rise
and fall of social movements. Although the late 1960s and early 1970s were marked by
strike waves (legal and wildcat) across western Europe and North America, the social
movement literature focused largely on movements such as civil rights, anti-war,
women’s and environmental. While a few studies brought labor and social movements
together in a limited way
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46 ref6">(Crouch and Pizzorno 1978; Sabel 1982)</xref>
        , analytical currents
moved significantly apart. While labor was viewed for the most part as an established
force with institutional support (and perhaps thus even part of the problem rather
than the solution), social movements were seen as fresh, insurgent, and fighting for
space within the political economy and society
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref39">(Offe, 1985; Habermas, 1989)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, just as American labor largely failed to ride the social movement
wave of the 1960s
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">(Turner 2003)</xref>
        , so too did the literatures on industrial relations and
political economy fail to incorporate the insights of a rich, new social movement
literature. And with the decline of the social movements of the 1960s, the narrow focus
persisted. By the 1980s, however, it was impossible to ignore the increasing effects of
global economic pressure as well as the newly aggressive posture on the part of many
firms and states.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the literature on corporatism challenged American pluralist thought from a
comparative perspective (e.g., labor plays a very different role in different societies),
the next wave of American literature accepted pluralist assumptions but challenged
conventional industrial relations views based on sub-system stability
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(Kochan, Katz
and McKersie 1986)</xref>
        . In a context of economic crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, this new
perspective emphasized the strategic choice of employers in the U.S., who increasingly
opposed unions and undermined traditional collective bargaining arrangements in
their response to competitive world markets
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(Piore and Sabel 1984)</xref>
        . Dynamic markets
and employer opposition (often backed by government policy) resulted in serious and
accelerating union decline in the U.S., destabilizing and in some cases marginalizing
the traditional industrial relations sub-system while offering little hope for unions
beyond concession bargaining and the acceptance of new employer-led flexibility and
labor-management cooperation. Labor’s decline in the U.S. and U.K. together with the
hegemony of Reagan/Thatcher free-market policies would have far reaching effects
on unions and workforces everywhere in an increasingly global economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the labor literature of the 1990s was dominated by strategic choice on the
one hand and institutionalism on the other, a new mobilization perspective emerged
hand-in-hand with the revitalization of labor movements, especially in the U.S. and
U.K.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref18 ref20 ref22 ref24 ref3 ref35 ref59">(Johnston 1994; Bronfenbrenner et al. 1998; Hurd 1998; Heery 1998; Kelly 1998;
Milkman and Wong 2001; Turner, Katz and Hurd 2001)</xref>
        . In contrast to earlier
literature, revitalization research emphasized the key role of union strategies, of unions and
workers as actors with choices that matter. Early postwar theorists (industrial relations
scholars, political scientists, sociologists) had seen unions as integrated, stable parties
to enduring bargaining arrangements, with rank-and-file participation largely
unnecessary (except in political elections and every once in a great while in the event of a
strike). Workforce demobilization was an assumption common to theorists of
American business unionism and European corporatism alike. Kochan, Katz and McKersie,
by contrast, reflected the break-up of postwar stability and viewed unions to a large
extent as victims of global markets, employer opposition and state policy. While
unions did have choices, none were very promising, with options limited by employer
attitudes and competitive markets: cooperation and limited participation seemed to
some the best route but offered little hope for turning around the protracted decline
of the American labor movement
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27 ref28 ref40">(cf. Kochan 1995; Kochan and Osterman, 1994)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>The new institutionalism also emphasized unions, employers and government as
actors integrated into a more or less stable framework of laws, organizations and
regularized relationships. With behavior shaped by institutional and political constraints,
however, labor was largely marginalized in the U.S. and U.K. in the 1980s and early
1990s, with little hope for any fundamental change.16 In all of these earlier
perspectives, whether unions were nicely integrated or unfortunate victims, there was little
room for labor as a movement, for coalition building, for expanded rank-and-file
activism, for activist leadership committed to reform, for an expansion of democracy in
the workplace and beyond.</p>
      <p>
        The latest wave of labor scholarship, by contrast, examines the potential for
unions to serve as pro-active organizers, system builders, grappling with and shaping the
challenges they face, to a large extent through coalition building and the mobilization
of participation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref3 ref59">(Bronfenbrenner et al. 1998; Kelly 1998; Turner, Katz and Hurd
2001)</xref>
        . This latest literature thus brings together insights from the long neglected (or
pigeon-holed) social movement literature with strategic choice from industrial
relations and the new or historical institutionalism from comparative political economy.
      </p>
      <p>Strategic choice and institutional literatures offered important breakthroughs, in
particular regarding concepts such as actor choice, strategic alternatives,
transformation, and the powerful shaping influence of existing institutions. But both perspectives
are also flawed. None of their conceptual frameworks, for example, could have
predicted the AFL-CIO turn toward organizing, coalition building, and local mobilization
16</p>
      <p>See, for example, Thelen 2001. The most recent incarnation of the comparative
institutional perspective, to which Thelen’s work contributes, is the “varieties of capitalism”
literature (Hall and Soskice 2001). In this view, labor is for the most part either nicely
integrated in the “coordinated market economies” or hopelessly marginalized in the “liberal
market economies.”
and the very real possibility of labor movement revitalization. Both postwar industrial
relations and new institutional perspectives favor system stability, taking institutions
and bargaining arrangements as given. Strategic choice with its focus on
transformation is more dynamic, reflecting changing world markets and power relations; yet the
emphasis is still on shoring up collective bargaining and shifting toward
labormanagement cooperation. Current revitalization literature, by contrast, seeks to
integrate institutions, global markets and debates, coalition building and rank-and-file
mobilization into a comprehensive actor-based framework, with a focus on describing
and explaining contemporary activism, its presence or absence, successes and failures,
effects both narrow and broad.</p>
      <p>Rejuvenated labor, environmental and campus movements in the U.S., as
indicated in living-wage, anti-sweatshop, sustainable development and Justice for Janitors
campaigns (and much more), offer surprising evidence for the resurgence of
progressive activism in America, at a critical historical juncture in which contrasting global
visions are just beginning to contend for prominence.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-15">
      <title>Concluding remarks</title>
      <p>There is no reason to believe that the global economy cannot be constructively
reformed in a contemporary, coalition-led push toward democratic globalism. To be
sure, the barriers are high, but new possibilities are also present. While we can only
speculate at this point about the institutions and policies that would predominate in a
democratic globalist world (and the typical safe academic approach by contrast is to
give all the reasons why the current one-sided and corrupt market globalism will
continue to dominate), we can point to some of the essential social forces coalescing
around reform efforts. Here in the world’s only remaining superpower, revitalized
labor, environmental and campus groups have been critical actors in promoting reform
aimed at local, national and global conditions. Predominantly local, such coalitions,
taken together across the United States, amount to a substantial movement for broad
economic and social policy reform, an American movement with potentially global
ramifications.</p>
      <p>The argument presented here first contends that this revitalization of social forces
in the U.S. is significant enough to need explanation, and, second, presents evidence
pointing toward key causal forces at work: chronic inequality, strategic leadership, and
most importantly coalition building. Because inequality is increasingly highlighted in
contemporary corporate scandals, because labor, environmental and campus
movements now offer strategic leadership with a greatly expanded perspective, and because
coalition building among these and other groups is rampant across a range of issues,
especially at the local level but increasingly at national and global levels as well, there is
reason to hope for the expansion of substantial ongoing reform efforts, right here in
the so-called “belly of the beast.”</p>
