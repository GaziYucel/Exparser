        <p>Overview of the Research Project The “Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations” project is an interdisciplinary cross-cultural study on values, fertility, and intergenerational relationships. The VOC study focuses on reasons for having or not having children and investigates the interplay of values and parent-child relationships in three generations and across cultures (cf. Trommsdorff/Kim/Nauck 2005; Trommsdorff/Nauck 2005, 2006, 2010). By now, a large data set with N = 16.461 participants (adolescents, their mothers and ma- Isabelle Albert ternal grandmothers and a sample of mothers with small children) is available from nineteen different countries in four continents. This report focuses on recent innovative research questions that are currently tackled by international researchers involved in the project. These topics refer to three thematic areas: value of children, intergenerational relations, and value transmission from a crosscultural perspective. These research questions have been raised in the framework of a recent international workshop on “Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations”, organized by Gisela Trommsdorff and Bernhard Nauck, principle investigators of the project, at the University of Konstanz (March 29th to 30th, 2012), and financially supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). Some of the studies briefly summarized below will be submitted for publication.</p>

      <p>assume that the lower son preference in South India can be explained by higher economic
positions and higher educational attainment. Initial analyses indicate that the investigated
socio-economic factors and the cultural context can only partly explain the different
regional son preferences. They offer the preliminary conclusion that “sex-specific costs and
benefits contribute to the explanation but they do not mediate between the considered
background variables and the son preference”.</p>
      <p>
        Cultural differences in negative VOC. Isabelle Albert, Gisela Trommsdorff, and
Katarzyna Lubiewska argue that perceived negative aspects of parenthood may be
important for the decision not to have children and may have a special explicative value
regarding the current low fertility rates in many European countries
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(cf. Eurostat 2012)</xref>
        . In
order to take into account different levels of socio-economic change, the researchers have
compared three different cohorts living in Western and Eastern Germany as well as in
Poland in their preliminary analyses. Results show that the same negative aspects of having
children seem to be most prominent in all subsamples: e.g., worries about job, financial
situation, children’s future. Overall, mothers from East Germany and older mothers from
West Germany were less concerned about having children than mothers from Poland,
young mothers from West Germany and adolescents from all subsamples. In all countries
adolescents’ intentions about having children in the future were associated to their level
of negative VOC. Negative VOC was further related to actual negative experiences in the
family and low satisfaction with the actual living situation in all subsamples and cohorts.

      <title>3 Intergenerational Relations: Inter- and Intracultural</title>

      <title>Comparisons</title>
      <p>
        Cross-cultural variations in intergenerational relations. In his recent work, Bernhard
Nauck argues that research on intergenerational solidarity and ambivalence suggests that
intergenerational relationships in wealthy societies are composed of both emotional
closeness and conflicts
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(e.g., Silverstein et al. 2010)</xref>
        . The aim of his work is to extend this
approach to culturally and economically diverse areas with different kinship systems.
Nauck has identified four latent classes of intergenerational relationships (‘ambivalent’,
‘amicable’, ‘disharmonious’, and ‘detached’) which were valid for matrilineal, patrilineal,
and bilineal kinship systems but varied in a systematic way. Results based on the VOC
data show that affection and conflict in intergenerational relationships are (apart from
opportunities, individual choices, and internalized norms) also structured by institutional
settings. Nauck concludes that “intergenerational ambivalence is not restricted to Western
individualism, but depends on how ‘exit’ and ‘voice’ in intergenerational relationships are
institutionally structured in relation to emotional and functional interdependence”.
Adolescents’ motivation to support parents. Kairi Kasearu and Dagmar Kutsar note that
research on intergenerational solidarity is mostly limited to parents and grown-up
children. Hence, a current aim of the researchers is to investigate adolescents’ motives for
helping their parents in a cross-cultural comparison. Their initial analyses indicate lower
levels of adolescents’ agreement with helping motives in Germany compared to Estonia
and Russia. In Russia, the rule-oriented and reciprocal help-giving motives were more
highly valued than in the other countries, which might indicate higher collectivism and
traditional family values
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(which is in line with Mayer/Kuramschew/Trommsdorff 2009)</xref>
        .
In Estonia the relation-oriented motivation to help was relatively highly valued.
Interestingly, in Estonia and to a lesser extent in Russia, the relations-oriented motive was highly
positive correlated with the rule-oriented motive. According to the researchers, both
motives refer to different aspects of normative solidarity: whereas external rule-oriented
motives refer to meeting expectations of others, the relations-oriented motive might be
interpreted as internal normative solidarity, assuming that readiness to help a parent is initiated
by the wish to sustain stability in the parent-child dyad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intergenerational solidarity and life satisfaction. The goal of an ongoing work by
Wolfgang Friedlmeier and Katarzyna Lubiewska is to detect different dyadic structures of
intergenerational solidarity based on relevant components (affectual, consensual,
associational, functional, and normative) of the intergenerational solidarity model
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(e.g.,
Bengtson/Roberts 1991)</xref>
        . The researchers have identified four major types of solidarity,
two of which occurred more often (harmonious and amicable) while the other two
occurred more rarely (ambivalent and distant). No cultural differences in the distributions
of patterns were found; however, dyads of daughters and mothers who did not have a
partner were more often characterized by distant solidarity in Poland and by ambivalent
solidarity in the USA. Results also showed that US daughters of “distant solidarity” dyads
scored higher on life satisfaction than US daughters of “ambivalent solidarity” dyads.
Polish mothers with “amicable” and “harmonious” patterns had higher life satisfaction
than Polish mothers with “distant” and “ambivalent” patterns of intergenerational
solidarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parenting and attachment. Katarzyna Lubiewska notes that past research has shown that
transmission of attachment is mainly associated with the quality of parenting
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(e.g., van
IJzendoorn/Bakermans-Kranenburg 1997)</xref>
        . As past research included often only two
generations, Lubiewska is now interested in the role of grandmothers and fathers in the
transmission process
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(e.g., Takahashi 2005)</xref>
        . One of her expectations is that grandmothers
and fathers differ in their influence on attachment transmission among different regions of
Poland due to historical divisions and current socio-political and economical change
within Poland. Results of first analyses indicate that a prediction of adolescents’ attachment
anxiety can only be made by parents’ attachment and parenting as “transmission belt”.
Interestingly, fathers’ anxiety was related to adolescents’ anxiety only in Southern regions,
whereas paternal avoidance influenced adolescents’ anxiety only in Western regions and
paternal rejection was predictive for adolescents’ anxiety in East Poland. Further, it was
found that culture functioned as a moderator between paternal attachment, rejection, and
adolescent anxiety.

      <title>4 Intergenerational Transmission of Values in Cross-Cultural</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Comparison</title>
      <p>
        The intergenerational transmission of Value of Children. Chin-Chun Yi and Yu-Hua Chen
claim that one reason for the decreasing fertility rate in East Asia is the changing VOC
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(e.g., Yu 2009)</xref>
        . Therefore, the aim of their study is to figure out the transmission of VOC
in three generations in two Chinese societies, with a focus on identifying identical factor
structures for cultural contexts for positive as well as for negative VOC. Analyses have
revealed for both China and Taiwan two factors for positive (physical/social and
emotional) as well as for negative VOC (physical/psychological constraint and familial/social
demand). Also, as hypothesized, the intergenerational transmission was more evident for
grandmother-mother and for mother-adolescent dyads than for grandmother-adolescent
dyads, especially for positive VOC. It was found that urban context and exposure to
modernity functioned as significant predictors for positive and negative VOC.
Parent-child value similarities within and across cultures. Daniela Barni, Ariel Knafo,
Asher Ben-Arieh, and Muhammed M. Haj-Yahia want to address shortcomings of earlier
research that has typically measured intergenerational transmission of values by focusing
on parent-child value similarity, thereby neglecting the role of a shared background – the
“cultural stereotype”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Kenny/Acitelli 1994)</xref>
        . In order to deal with this desideratum, the
researchers have compared samples from two different cultural contexts, focusing on value
similarity between parents and adolescent children. In general, the endorsement of
cultural stereotypes was higher for Italian than for Israeli participants, and was higher for
mothers than for adolescents. Regarding intergenerational transmission of values it was found
that collectivistic values were more strongly transmitted from parent to child, whereas
similarities in individualistic values could be partly explained by the effect of a cultural
stereotype. The researchers conclude that the transmission of socially-supported values
needs little investment from the family in a value homogenous context (family as a
“source of socio-cultural stability”). In a more value heterogeneous context the
transmission of family specific values may be more successful (family as “source of socio-cultural
change”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Adolescents’ relationship with maternal grandmothers. Mihaela Friedlmeier, Isabelle
Albert, Gisela Trommsdorff, and Cigdem Kagitcibasi investigate at present the relationship
quality between grandmothers and grandchildren by taking into account the role of the
mother as a mediator. It is presumed that mothers might influence the
grandchildgrandparent relation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(e.g., Chan/Elder 2000)</xref>
        . Most research on the mediating role of the
middle generation has been carried out in Western, individualistic contexts. Therefore, the
authors have chosen Germany and USA to represent individualistic cultures, and China
and Turkey to represent collectivist cultures. First results show that the middle generation
is an important mediator between non-adjacent generations, and this may point to an
intergenerational transmission of relationship quality. Interestingly, the quality of the
adolescent-mother relationship was more strongly linked to the adolescent-grandmother
relationship than to the mother-grandmother relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Value of Children and intergenerational relationships in adjacent generations. The study
by Boris Mayer, Beate Schwarz, and Gisela Trommsdorff includes ten cultures and
focuses on country-level macro variables (social development and overall cultural
orientation) as well as family-related value orientations regarding intergenerational (adult
daughters and their mothers) relationship quality and social support. For example, it was found
that cultural wealth was related to lower hierarchical values and lower material
interdependence values of the family and children
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(which is in line with Kagitcibasi 2007)</xref>
        . The
researchers reason that “cultural syndromes of independence and interdependence exist
regarding value orientations”, and they are associated with cultural wealth. However,
there was no evidence for such cultural syndromes with regard to relationship quality and
support. Differences between collectivistic and individualistic cultures regarding intimate
family relations are rather a matter of “type rather than amount of relatedness”.

      <title>5 Conclusions and Outlook</title>
      <p>In the light of ongoing demographic changes all over the world and the related
socioeconomic and cultural change, it has become more than ever necessary to relate context,
socio-economic change, family, and individual development. The currently ongoing
studies within the VOC-framework take this claim into consideration by focusing and
combining different levels of analysis in line with the culture-informed model of
intergenerational relationships across the lifespan (see also Trommsdorff/Albert in press).</p>
