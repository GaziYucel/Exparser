Globalization here is understood to be a multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, multiform,
and multicausal process, which has much less of an explanans and more of an
explanandum. In recent analysis globalization has been found to be about place, space, and
scale. Yet, following its title, this paper argues that it is about time too. In other words,
globalization is also a spatio-temporal process. The nature of this process, its relation with
the development of capitalist economies and the role of the state, are at the core of this
paper.</p>

      <title>Zusammenfassung</title>
      <p>Globalisierung wird hier als Prozess verstanden mit vielfältigen Ursachen und
Ausprägungen, mit zeitlichen und räumlichen Aspekten sowie einer polyzentrischen Natur.
Dabei wird Globalisierung weniger als erklärendes, sondern vielmehr als zu erklärendes
Phänomen gedeutet. In der gegenwärtigen sozialwissenschaftlichen Analyse wird
Globalisierung in Zusammenhang mit örtlichen, räumlichen und skalaren Veränderungen
gebracht. Wie der Titel dieses Papiers aber andeutet, handelt es sich ebenso um ein
zeitbezogenes Phänomen: Globalisierung wird somit als räumlich-zeitlicher Prozess
verstanden. Die Natur dieses Prozesses, seine Verbindungen mit der Entwicklung
kapitalistischer Ökonomien und die Rolle des Staates werden im Fokus dieser Arbeit stehen.</p>

The title of this paper involves a deliberate play on words. It is also meant to make some
serious theoretical and political points about the nature of globalization. It is certainly not
about time that we begin to talk of globalization. On the contrary, the time is now well past
when it first began to be seriously questioned. Indeed, for many commentators, it is high time
that the concept of globalization was banned. Nor does the title indicate that strategies to
promote globalization are overdue and that it is about time that the globalization project was
taken further. Instead the title is intended to suggest that it is high time that we recognized –
both theoretically and politically – that globalization is not just about place, space, and scale.
It is about time too. Globalization is a phenomenon of a ‘runaway world,’ of the annihilation of
distance by time, of the increasing acceleration of social events and processes. And, to go
further, it is a phenomenon that causes problems as much, if not more, because of its
complex temporalities as it does because of its complex spatialities. In short, if we are to
understand and control globalization, it is about time that we realized that it is a
spatiotemporal process.</p>
        <p>In developing this argument, I first critique some recent simplified ideas about globalization,
insisting on its many complexities and suggesting that the concept of globalization would be
better seen as an explanandum than as an explanans. Second, building on the multicentric,
multiscalar, and multitemporal features of globalization as well as the notions of time-space
distantiation and time-space compression, I argue that the spatial turn involved in many
recent discussions of globalization has been overdone and that it is time to combine it with a
temporal (re)turn that can do justice to the complex spatio-temporalities of globalization. I
illustrate this argument from Marx’s work on the political economy of capitalism and,
especially, his analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics that are generated by its
organization as an economy of time. Third, in this context I introduce the concept of
spacetime and spatio-temporal fixes and draw out some of the theoretical implications of
such fixes for understanding the nature and problems of globalization. Fourth, I explore
some of the temporal contradictions of the current globalizing phase of a post-Fordist,
knowledge-based capitalism. Fifth, in the light of these remarks, I consider the implications of
globalization for the national state, noting in particular the challenges to its temporal
sovereignty. Here I consider the politics of time involved in globalization, the ways in which
this challenges the national sovereign state and the practices of democratic politics, and then
suggest some ways to address the acceleration of economic processes associated with the
current wave of globalization. My reflections conclude with some general remarks on the
importance of temporality to an understanding and critique of globalization.</p>
      </sec>

    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>1. Globalization</title>
      <p>‘Globalization’ is a polyvalent, promiscuous, controversial word that often obscures more
than it reveals about recent economic, political, social, and cultural changes. It is best used
to denote a multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, multiform, and multicausal process.
First, it is multicentric because it emerges from activities in many places rather than from a
single centre. It cannot be reduced to Americanization, as some critics of American
imperialism suggest, but emanates from many sites around the globe. Moreover, even if one
were to insist against the evidence that it was primarily an American-initiated phenomenon, it
would still be necessary to recognize the plurality of globalization processes and effects
depending on whether one looked at American influences emanating from New York as a
financial centre, Washington as an imperial city, Atlanta as a global news factory, Hollywood
as an entertainment capital, Silicon Valley as the centre of informational capitalism, and so
on. The same point would apply, of course, to the alleged centrality of other national
formations.</p>
      <p>
        Second, globalization is multiscalar because it emerges from actions on many scales –
which can no longer be seen as nested in a neat hierarchy but as co-existing and
interpenetrating in a tangled and confused manner – and it develops and deepens the scalar
as well as the spatial division of labour. This excludes any simple opposition between the
global and the national or the global and the local. Indeed, in some ways, the global is little
more than ‘a hugely extended network of localities’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6 ref9">(Czarniawska and Sevón 1996: 22)</xref>
        . More
generally, what could be described from one vantagepoint as globalization might be
redescribed (and, perhaps, more accurately) in rather different terms from one or more
alternative scalar viewpoints: for example, as internationalization, triadization, regional bloc
formation, global city network-building, cross-border region formation, international
localization, glocalization, glurbanization, or transnationalization. For, regardless of their own
distinctive dynamics, if any, each of these scalar processes is also linked more or less
closely into the overall dynamic of globalization – whether as modifying, counteracting, or
reinforcing processes.
      </p>
      <p>Third, the latter dynamic is multitemporal because it involves an ever more complex
restructuring and re-articulation of temporalities and time horizons. This aspect is captured in
the notions of time -space distantiation and time -space compression. The former process
involves the stretching of social relations over time and space so that relations can be
controlled or co-ordinated over longer periods of time (including the ever more distant future)
and longer distances, greater areas, or more scales of activity. The ultimate spatial horizon of
time-space distantiation is, of course, total control over social relations on a fully integrated
global scale into the foreseeable future. There are good reasons, however, to regard this
ultimate horizon as implausible. The latter process involves the intensification of ‘discrete’
events in real time and/or the increased velocity of material and immaterial flows over a
given distance. This is also a significant (and also incompletely developed) aspect of
globalization and, indeed, it is time-space compression more than time-space distantiation
that is more distinctive of the most recent wave of globalization. If we examine the interaction
between these two processes, it becomes evident that much of the fascination with
globalization is rooted in the increased significance of social forces and processes that
combine capacities for time-space distantiation and compression: the most obvious (in the
sense of most cited) case is hypermobile financial capital that can circulate globally in real
time. But focusing on such cases ignores the significance of other forces and processes that
are located elsewhere in the two-dimensional property space that can be derived from using
degrees of time-space distantiation and time-space compression as its respective horizontal
and vertical axes.</p>
      <p>Fourth, globalization is multiform. It assumes different forms in different contexts and can be
realized through different strategies – neo-liberal globalization with its emphasis on the
integration of the world market along neo-liberal lines is only one of these general forms and
even this having several significant variants. Once one allows for other forms of
technological and economic globalization and other sites and processes of globalization
across different functional systems and the lifeworld (or civil society), then the multiformity of
globalization appears even more strongly.</p>
      <p>Finally, globalization is clearly multicausal because it results from the complex, contingent
interaction of many different causal processes. For, taken together, the preceding features
mean that, far from globalization being a unitary causal mechanism, it should be understood
as the complex, emergent product of many different forces operating on many scales. Hence
nothing can be explained in terms of the causal powers of globalization – let alone causal
powers that are inevitable and irreversible and that are actualized on some intangible stage
behind our backs or on some intangible plane above our heads. Instead globalizations
themselves need explaining in all their manifold spatio-temporal complexity. This does not
exclude specific hypotheses about the impact of clearly specifiable processes on particular
sets of social relations. Thus one might be able to investigate the extent to which the
increasing hypermobility of financial capital affects the capacities of national states to set real
interest rates to secure full employment levels of demand. But one could not meaningfully
investigate the wild and overgeneral claim that "globalization undermines the power of the
state.” This point highlights the more general point about the multicentric, multiscalar,
multitemporal, and multiform nature of globalization. Moreover, once we understand how
globalizing processes are generated and how they operate, we can better intervene in their
production and better resist some of their effects.</p>
      <p>In spite of these arguments, it is still possible and worthwhile to reflect on the nature of
globalization. But we must define globalization with all due caution and in ways that allow for
the above-mentioned complexities. Thus I would propose here that globalization has both
structural and strategic moments. Structurally, it involves the objective processes whereby
increasing global interdependence is created among actions, organizations, and institutions
within (but not necessarily across) different functional systems (economy, law, politics,
education, science, sport, etc.) and the lifeworld that lies beyond them. These processes
occur on various spatial scales, operate differently in each functional subsystem, involve
complex and tangled causal hierarchies rather than a simple, unilinear, bottom-up or
topdown movement, and often display an eccentric ‘nesting’ of the different scales of social
organization. They also develop unevenly in spacetime. Nonetheless, globalization can be
said to increase insofar as the co-variation of actions, events, and institutional orders
involves more (and more important) relevant activities, is spatially more extensive, and
occurs more rapidly.</p>
      <p>Strategically, globalization refers to conscious attempts to promote global co-ordination of
activities in (but not necessarily across) different functional subsystems and/or in the
lifeworld. This does not require that the actors involved are physically present at all points in
the planet but only requires them to monitor relevant activities, communicate about these,
and try to co-ordinate their activities with others to produce global effects. Such co-ordination
efforts range from generalized meta-steering (constitutional or institutional design) intended
to produce a more or less comprehensive global order through creation of international
regimes to particularistic pursuit of specific economic-corporate interests within such (meta-)
frameworks. There is clearly scope for wide variation here as shown by the neo-liberal,
market-led globalization promoted by the World Bank, the horizontal ‘global governance’
favoured by proponents (especially NGOs) of democratic international regimes, and plans for
more top-down inter-statal government. Not all actors are (or could hope to be) major global
players but many more have to monitor the global as a horizon of action, the implications of
changing scalar divisions, and the impact of time-space distantiation and compression on
their identities, interests, and strategies. The overall course of globalization will be the largely
unintended, relatively chaotic outcome of interaction among various strategies to shape or
resist globalization in a complex, path-dependent world society. It follows that any account of
globalization is likely to be partial and incomplete, exaggerating some features, missing
others, and risking neglect of events and processes on other scales.</p>
      <p>Globalization is part of a proliferation of scales and temporalities as narrated, institutionalized
objects of action, regularization, and governance. The number of scales and temporalities of
action that can be distinguished is immense but far fewer ever get explicitly institutionalized.
How far this happens depends on the prevailing technologies of power – material, social,
and spatio-temporal – that enable the identification and institutionalization of specific scales
of action and temporalities. It is the development of new logistical means (of distantiation,
compression, communication), organizational technologies, institutions with new
spatiotemporal horizons of action, broader institutional architectures, new global standards
(including world time), and modes of governance that helps to explain this growing
proliferation of economically and politically significant institutionalized scales and
temporalities. Moreover, as new scales and temporalities emerge and/or existing ones gain
in institutional thickness, social forces also tend to develop new mechanisms to link or
coordinate them. This in turn often prompts efforts to co-ordinate these new co-ordination
mechanisms. Thus, as the triad regions begin to acquire institutional form and identity, new
forums develop to co-ordinate their bilateral relations. Likewise, as regionalism develops in
the European Union, we find not only an EU-wide Committee of the Regions but also a
proliferation of other peak associations and multilateral linkages among regions. Even further
down the scale, local authorities develop associations to promote their interests at national,
regional, international, and global levels. All of this produces increasing scalar complexity,
increasing scope for deliberate interscalar articulation, and increasing problems in making
such interscalar articulation work. Similar issues occur in relation to time and its governance.
This can be seen in the rise of nano -temporalities at the micro-level and long -term action to
ensure environmental sustainability at the macro-level. And this leads in turn to growing
problems of intertemporal governance.</p>

      <title>2. Globalization and the Spatial Turn</title>
      <p>
        Commentators often portray globalization as one of the driving forces in the ‘spatial turn’ in
the social sciences and/or as one of its most important products. For, insofar as globalization
appears to be an essentially spatial phenomenon, it allegedly demands an approach that is
sensitive to issues of space, place, and scale. Moreover, when we approach globalization in
such terms, this often changes how other issues are seen. The spatial turn can be thematic,
methodological, or both
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(cf. Jessop 2001)</xref>
        . In the first sense it involves thematizing
intrinsically spatial issues as objects of analysis. This sort of turn is hardly controversial
provided that it does not lead to a fetishistic naturalization of space, place, and scale or to
the belief that space, place, and scale have their own autonomous properties regardless of
their social constitution and reproduction and regardless of their articulation with other
moments of social relations. In the second sense, the spatial turn involves an investigation of
more complex issues by using their spatial moments as an entry point, without this requiring
that the investigation does not proceed beyond the spatial. In either case, the spatial turn
could involve little more than an innocent, belated, and welcome recognition that space
matters in one or more ways; but it could also involve the belief that an earlier interest in time
and temporal issues was mistaken, overdone, or at best misleading. In short, there is a risk
that the spatial turn is seen as a simple alternative to a focus on temporality. What is really
required is a discussion of spatio-temporality rather than implying that there is a choice
between them.
      </p>
      <p>The ability to integrate the spatial and temporal aspects of globalization is evident in Marx’s
critique of political economy and his analysis of capitalism in terms of an economy of time.</p>
      <p>
        The key point here is that the spatial dynamic of capitalism can be derived in the first
instance from the competition among capitalists to reduce socially necessary labour time as
well as the total time involved in production. Marx showed that individual capitals are subject
to competitive pressure to reduce production, circulation, and turnover times. They also face
pressure to innovate in other ways that may affect the spatial and scalar divisions of labour.
In this sense, although place and space are certainly regarded as a basic material
presupposition of all social activities, their entry into Marx’s analysis as major variables come
much later in the course of his analysis. They are first seriously introduced in terms of
particular capitals rather than capital in general; in terms of turnover time rather than
production time; and in the context of use-value (e.g., transportation) rather than that of
value or exchange-value
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(de la Haye 1988)</xref>
        . This spatial reorganization was as prone to
contradictions, however, as any feature of capital as a social relation. For our purposes, this
implies, of course, that globalization is also contradictory and will have its limits.
These points about Marx’s analysis of time and space are worth making because contrasting
views have been expressed about their relative primacy in capitalism. It has been suggested
that capital’s concern with the production of value leads to an emphasis on increasing the
socially necessary labour time embodied in commodities (the time of labour); that its concern
with the production of surplus value leads to an emphasis on control over space and the
importance of constructing and reconstructing space relations and the global space
economy; that its concern with profits leads to an emphasis on reducing the socially
necessary turnover time of circulating capital and that this is often associated with command
over space (means of communication and transportation) as well as organizational
innovations; that its concern with social use-value is associated with an emphasis on the
spatial relations that determine the usefulness of particular goods and services and/or on the
time and/or timing of the delivery of goods and services; and, finally, those who take class
struggle as their entry point (especially the struggles of subordinate classes) tend to focus on
place and space. For, as Soja comments, class struggle ‘must encompass and focus upon
the vulnerable point: the production of space, the territorial structure of exploitation and
domination, the spatially controlled reproduction of the system as a whole’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Soja 1989: 92)</xref>
        .
Such contrasting opinions are not so much signs of intellectual incoherence as expressions
of basic contradictions in capitalism itself. This is reflected in the contrast between the
mobility of abstract money capital in a space of flows and the commodified production and
consumption of specific use-values in specific times and places. Yet even this contrast is
only ever tendential and relative, for ‘in every instance when we accentuate space or time,
the other aspect is still present, although hidden’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6 ref9">(Czarniawska and Sevón 1996: 21)</xref>
        . Thus
the mobility of abstract money capital in a space of flows depends on the development of the
sort of fixed technical and social infrastructures that characterize the emerging network of
global cities. And the production and consumption of specific use-values involves a spatial
and scalar division of labour which must also be co-ordinated across different time scales
(e.g., associated with different production cycles, different ratios of fixed to circulating capital,
and different degrees of durability of goods and services destined for private consumption).
There are also ‘contradictory movements in which time is simultaneously compressed and
expanded, depending on which part of the system one examines, so that the general
progression is uneven and punctuated by more or less significant reverses’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Schoenberger
1997: 19)</xref>
        . This suggests the need to make a thematic and metho dological temporal (re)turn
to redress one-sided concern with space in studies of globalization. Interestingly, just such a
temporal (re)turn can be seen in a growing recognition of the need to bring time (back) into
the analysis of globalization among those who had previously privileged the spatial.

    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>Contradictions of Capitalism</title>
      <p>Here I want to argue that the reproduction and regularization of capital as a social relation
involves a social fix (complex mode of regularization) that compensates for the inherent
incompleteness of the pure capital relation, i.e., its inability to secure the conditions for the
continued expansion of capital accumulation purely in and through the operation of
profitoriented, market-mediated economic forces. This social fix is always time-and-place specific
and gives a specific dynamic to capital accumulation through its distinctive, historically
variable, and inherently unstable articulation of economic and extra-economic elements. The
importance of these extra-economic elements is widely recognized, of course, in very
different social scientific literatures (Smithian, Marxian, Weberian, Durkheimian, liberal and
neo-liberal, institutionalist, etc). But there is also widespread disagreement about its
implications. On my reading, this social fix helps to secure a relatively durable structural
coherence in managing the contradictions and dilemmas inherent in the capital relation so
that different forms, institutions, and practices tend to be mutually reinforcing. This includes
the imposition on these economic and extra-economic elements of a distinctive
spatiotemporal fix.</p>
      <p>Structurally, these spatio-temporal fixes emerge when an accumulation regime and its
complex mode of regularization co-evolve to produce a certain structural coherence within a
given spatio-temporal framework but not beyond it. This is typically associated with a
distinctive hierarchy of the various structural or institutional forms of capitalism that thereby
affects their interactions within the institutional architecture as a whole and shapes the
overall logic of the spatio-temporal fix. This hierarchy involves giving greater priority to the
regularizing of some structural forms (and giving greater priority, perhaps, to one or other
aspect of their associated contradictions and dilemmas) than to other structural forms. These
priorities will vary with accumulation regimes, modes of growth, and governance capacities.
In the Atlantic Fordism associated with the thirty years of postwar economic expansion in
most advanced capitalist economies, for example, the wage and money forms were the
principal structural forms at the heart of the mode of regularization. In constrast, in the
emerging post-Fordist regime based on a globalizing knowledge-based economy, other
forms have become more important and, indeed, critical to the eventual consolidation of a
new accumulation regime and mode of regularization. These are the forms of competition
and the institutional forms and functions of the state. Or, again, while liberal market
economies may give more weight to labour-power as a substitutable factor of production and
to the wage as a cost of production, more co-ordinated capitalist economies may prioritize
labour-power in its guise as human capital (sic) and the wage as a source of demand.
Strategically, because capitalism’s contradictions and dilemmas are insoluble in the abstract,
they are resolved – partially and provisionally, if at all – through the formulation-realization of
specific accumulation strategies at various economic and political scales in specific
spatiotemporal contexts.</p>
      <p>Such spatio-temporal fixes delimit the main spatial and temporal boundaries within which
structural coherence is secured, and externalize certain costs of securing this coherence
beyond these boundaries. Even within these boundaries some classes, class fractions,
social categories or other social forces located inside these spatio-temporal boundaries are
marginalized, excluded, or oppressed. Thus, spatio-temporal fixes also facilitate the
institutionalized compromises on which accumulation regimes and modes of regulation
depend, and subsequently come to embody them. This can involve super-exploitation of
internal or external spaces outside the compromise, super-exploitation of nature or inherited
social resources, deferral of problems into an indefinite future and, of course, the exploitation
and/or oppression of specific classes, strata or other social categories.</p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, insofar as such compromises marginalize forces that act as bearers of
functions or operations essential to long-run accumulation, the growth of significant
imbalances, disproportionalities or disunity in the circuit of capital will tend to strengthen the
hand of these forces, enabling them to disrupt the institutionalized compromises involved in
a particular accumulation regime, mode of regulation, state form and spatio-temporal fix
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(cf.
Clarke 1977)</xref>
        . Such crises typically act as a steering mechanism for the always provisional,
partial and unstable re-equilibration of capital accumulation insofar as they prompt attempts
to guide the forcible reimposition of the unity of the circuit of capital through new
accumulation strategies and modes of regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary scales and temporal horizons around which such fixes are built and the extent
of their coherence vary considerably over time. This is reflected in the variable coincidence
of different boundaries, borders or frontiers of action and the changing primacy of different
scales. Political boundaries, for example, have been characterized by medieval polymorphy,
Westphalian exclusivity, and post-Westphalian complexity. Likewise, the consolidation of
capitalism witnessed the national eclipse of the urban scale as cities were integrated into
national economic systems and subordinated to the political power of national territorial
states. And the national scale has since been challenged by the rise of global city networks
more oriented to other global cities than to national hinterlands.
These ideas have important implications for accumulation strategies, state projects, and
hegemonic projects on various scales of action and over different time horizons. For each of
these involves an attempt to strategically co-ordinate activities across different systems and
the lifeworld in order to achieve a limited, localized structural coherence in accumulation,
state activities and social formations respectively. There is ample scope for competition
among social forces over accumulation strategies, state projects, and hegemonic visions as
well as for potential disjunctions between the strategies that emerge from such competition
to dominate their respective imagined spheres. In this context a key role is played by the
rivalries and struggles of intellectual forces, individually and collectively, in a free-floating or
an organized manner, to articulate strategies, projects and visions that seek to reconcile
contradictions and conflicts and to resolve dilemmas for various sites and scales of action
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(cf. Gramsci 1971)</xref>
        . The principal forces involved in these rivalries and struggles are
organized interests, political parties, and social movements with the mass media rather than
the public sphere now having a central position in the mediation of the struggle for
hegemony in these matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of a given spatio-temporal fix, different institutions, apparatuses or agencies may
specialize primarily in one or other horn of a dilemma, deal with it over different temporal
horizons, or address different aspects at different times. The state may also alter the balance
between institutions, apparatuses and agencies by reallocating responsibilities and
resources, allowing them to compete for political support and legitimacy as circumstances
change, etc. Such strategies may be pursued entirely within the state or extend to the
division between state and non -state modes of governance. Another way to manage
potential problems arising from the limits of different modes of policy-making or
crisismanagement is through variable policy emphases across different scales of action and
temporal horizons. For example, in Atlantic Fordism, the national state set the
macroeconomic framework, the local state acted as its relay for many nationally -determined
policies, and intergovernmental cooperation in various international regimes maintained the
conditions for national economic growth. Likewise, in contemporary neoliberal accumulation
regimes, a relative neglect of substantive (as opposed to formal) supply-side conditions at
the international and national levels in favour of capital flows in and through space is partly
compensated by more interventionist policies at the regional, urban and local levels, where
many material interdependencies among specific productive capitals are located
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6 ref9">(Gough and
Eisenschitz 1996)</xref>
        . This helps explain why local states are being reorganized as new forms of
local or regional partnership emerge to guide and promote the development of local or
regional resources.

      <p>Another example of spatial-scalar divisions of labour is the distinction between foreign and
domestic relations inherent in the modern state system such that some parts of the state
apparatus specialize in external relations, some in internal relations. However, with the
growing impact of globalization and new forms of competitiveness, inherited divisions of
state labour change. Thus, not only is the distinction between domestic and foreign policy
becoming blurred; but subnational governments are now getting engaged in foreign
(economic) policy through cross-border cooperation, international localization, and so on, at
the same time as supranational bodies get involved in the redesign and reorientation of
subnational politics.</p>
      <p>There can also be a temporal division of labour with different institutions, apparatuses or
agencies responding to contradictions, dilemmas and paradoxes over different time
horizons. This is reflected in the conventional distinction between planning and execution
within organizations and in the primacy of different temporal horizons across organizations
(for example, banks and central banks, computer-programmed arbitrage funds and long-term
venture capital funds). Similarly, corporatist arrangements have often been established to
address long-term economic and social issues where complex, reciprocal interdependence
requires long-term cooperation – thereby taking the relevant policy areas outside the
shortterm time horizons of electoral cycles and parliamentary in-fighting. In both cases there is
scope for activities to rebalance relations among these institutions, apparatuses or agencies
through differential allocation of resources; allowing them to compete for legitimacy in
changing circumstances.</p>

      <title>Contemporary Capitalism</title>
      <p>The multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, multiform, and multicausal processes associated
with globalization enhance capital’s capacity to defer and displace its internal contradictions,
if not to resolve them, by increasing the scope of its operations on a global scale, by
reinforcing its capacities to disembed certain of its operations from local material, social, and
spatio-temporal constraints, by enabling it to deepen the spatial and scalar divisions of
labour, by creating more opportunities for moving up, down, and across scales, by
commodifying and securitizing the future, by deferring past and present material problems
into the future, by promoting long-term technology forecasting, organizational learning, and
trust building, and by re-articulating different time horizons. These enhanced capacities can
markedly reinforce tendencies to uneven development as the search continues for new
spatio-temporal displacements and new spatio-temporal fixes. Above all, globalization helps
to emancipate the exchange-value moment of capital from extra-economic and
spatiotemporal constraints, increases the emphasis on speed, acceleration, and turnover time, and
enhances capital’s capacity to escape the control of other systems insofar as these are still
territorially differentiated and fragmented. 1 This is linked to its increased capacity for
discounting events (so collapsing the future into the present), its increased capacity for
time1 Conversely, the growth of global legal and political systems and other international regimes means that mobile
capital will remain subject to their constraints.
space compression, its resort to complex derivative trading to manage risk, and its capacities
to jump scale. Finally, globalization weakens the capacity of national states to guide capital’s
expansion within a framework of national security (as reflected in the ‘national security
state’), national welfare (as reflected in social democratic welfare states), or some other
national project with a corresponding spatio-temporal fix. And, conversely, it increases the
pressures on national states to adjust to the time horizons and temporalities of mobile capital
able to operate beyond their frontiers.</p>
      <p>
        In short, the development of a globalizing capitalism typically intensifies the spatio-temporal
contradictions and tensions inherent in the capital relation and/or its articulation and
coevolution with the spatialities and temporalities of the natural and social world beyond the
sphere of value relations. The increasing emphasis on speed and the growing acceleration
of social life is particularly disruptive and disorienting
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(see Virilio 1994; 1998)</xref>
        . Here I want to
note five tensions or contradictions it introduces into the globalizing economy. These are not
engendered by globalization as such; my approach to globalization rules this out. But they
are tensions or contradictions that become more severe with the increasing organizational
and spatio-temporal complexity and flexibility in the circuits of capital associated with
globalization.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, there is a tension between the complex, reciprocally interdependent substantive
reproduction requirements of real natural, social, and cultural processes and the simplified,
one-sided, monetized temporalities involved in capital’s emphasis on exchange-value.
Globalization reinforces this tension by making it easier for capital to destroy the local
bounties of first and second nature and then move on without regard to their long-term
reproduction. Indeed, the growing emphasis on artificial short -term profit means that, ‘as
capital speeds up, it diminishes or degrades the conditions of the natural reproduction of
natural things’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Brennan 1995: 31)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, there is a tension among the many and varied substantive temporalities of human
existence (biological, sentient, sociocultural, self-reflexive) and the abstract time inherent in
the commodification of labour power and the dominance of formal market rationality
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref26">(Stahel
1999: 108; see also Polanyi 1944)</xref>
        . This is reflected in the stresses of everyday life and in a
growing sense of time-space compression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, contemporary capitalism involves a paradox that ‘(t)he most advanced economies
function more and more in terms of the extra-economic’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(Veltz 1996: 12)</xref>
        . This rests on the
increasing interdependence between economic and extra-economic factors making for
structural competitiveness. This is linked to the growth of new technologies based on more
complex transnational, national, and regional systems of innovation, to the paradigm shift
from Fordism with its emphasis on productivity growth rooted in economies of scale to
postFordism with its emphasis on mobilising social as well as economic sources of flexibility and
entrepreneurialism, and to the more general attempts to penetrate micro-social relations in
the interests of valorization. It is reflected in the emphasis now given to social capital, trust,
and communities of learning as well as to the competitive role of entrepreneurial cities,
enterprise culture, and enterprising subjects. This paradox generates a major contradiction
between short-term economic calculation (especially in financial flows) and the long-term
dynamic of ‘real competition’ rooted in resources (skills, trust, heightened reflexivity,
collective mastery of techniques, economies of agglomeration and size) that may take years
to create, stabilize, and reproduce. Likewise, spatially, there is a basic contradiction between
the economy seen as a de-territorialized, socially disembedded space of flows and as a
territorially rooted, socially embedded system of extra-economic as well as economic
resources, competencies, and activities
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(Storper 1997)</xref>
        . The latter moment is reflected in
wide range of new concepts to describe the knowledge-driven economy – national, regional,
and local systems of innovation, innovative milieus, systemic or structural competitiveness,
learning regions, social capital, trust, learning-by-doing, speed-based competition, etc. This
poses new dilemmas for the stabilization of the capital relation over more scales and over
increasingly compressed as well as extended temporal horizons of action.
      </p>
      <p>Fourth, temporally, there is a tension between the drive to accelerate the circulation of capital
by shortening the production cycle between design and final consumption and the long-term
infrastructural development on which this depends. In this context, Harvey notes that ‘[I]t
takes a specific organization of space to try and annihilate space and it takes capital of long
turnover time to facilitate the more rapid turnover of the rest. But the reduction of spatial
barriers has an equally powerful opposite effect; small-scale and finely graded differences
between the qualities of places (their labor supply, their infrastructures, and political
receptivity, their resource mixes, their market niches, etc.) become even more important
because multinational capital is better able to exploit them. (1996a: 246–7). This set of
contradictions is aggravated by the increasing capacity for temporal compression linked to
the latest ICT developments, which distresses many other fractions of capital and puts
pressure on the state and other less mobile social forces.</p>
      <p>
        Fifth, spatially, there is a tension between extending the scope of markets through the
annihilation of space by time and the need for fixed infrastructure to enable rapid movement
through space (which must be destroyed in turn as the next round of accumulation develops)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Harvey 1996b: 6)</xref>
        . This contradiction may be aggravated by the expansion of production
through mechanization and scale economies. Because this requires larger markets, it
extends the time of commodity circulation and may also extend the overall turnover time due
to the higher proportion of fixed to total capital. It can also lead to a dialectic of spatial
concentration (agglomeration economies) and dispersal (congestion, land prices,
unionization, etc.)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Schoenberger 1997: 19–21)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        There are spiral processes at work in the last two contradictions that tend to increase the
spatio-temporal complexities of regularizing and governing capital accumulation. ‘Every local
decentralization presupposes a renewed form of centralization at a higher level. Every
temporal flexibilization requires, with increasing complexity, new mechanisms in order to hold
the seemingly loosening temporal connections together. Flexibility becomes possible against
the background of a previously unattained degree of constant temporal availability, as the
prerequisite and consequence of which it functions’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Nowotny 1994: 99)</xref>
        . There are also
oscillations in the relative importance of time and space. Thus, whereas mass production
compressed time in production, it extended it in product life cycles to valorize dedicated fixed
capital and allow for the unmanageability of time required for product development. Now the
situation is reversed. The current emphasis is on speeding up product development times
and order-to-delivery cycle. This also involves maximum flexibility in organization of
production, economies of scope, etc.

      <title>5. The Implications of Globalization for (National) States</title>
      <p>
        Much has been written on the implications of globalization for the possible demise of the
national state and/or the national state’s importance for continuing globalization. Such
commentaries have been plagued by false oppositions and assumptions. The first false
opposition is posited most starkly as that between the state as a ‘power container’ that
operates exclusively within defined territorial frontiers and the economy as a borderless
exchange mechanism with no important territorial anchoring. This opposition commits four
errors in its conception of the state and economy. First, states (and the social forces they
represent) are actively involved in constituting and reconstituting the spatio-temporal
matrices that organize politics, including its inter-state and international moments
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref19">(Gross
1985; Poulantzas 1978)</xref>
        . Thus there is no reason to assume the fixity of its frontiers or
temporal horizons. Second, as form-determined condensations of a changing balance of
social forces, state apparatuses and state power will reflect the manifold processes that
produce globalization. Thus the state apparatus may interiorize the interests of foreign
capital as well as project the interests of national capital abroad
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref19">(Poulantzas 1975, 1978)</xref>
        .
Third, the economy should not be reduced to a market-mediated space of flows operating in
timeless time: markets also operate in accordance with other spatio-temporalities and the
economy more generally involves various non-market governance mechanisms with yet
other spatio-temporal dynamics. It follows that the regularization and governance of
globalization involves many different scales and temporal horizons. And, fourth, the
specificity of many economic assets and their embedding in extra-economic institutions
mean that much economic activity remains place- and time-bound. Combining these
objections, one could conclude that the state operates as a power connector, i.e., as a nodal
or network state within a broader political system
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Brunn 1999: 114)</xref>
        , as well as a power
container; and, likewise, that the economy has important territorial dimensions (reflected in
concepts such as industrial districts, agglomeration economies, global cities, and regional or
national capitalisms). Thus we should focus on the changing organization of politics and
economics and their respective institutional embodiments and see frontiers and borders as
actively reproduced and contingent rather than as pregiven and fixed.
      </p>
      <p>Another false opposition involves treating the state as a political force and globalization as
an economic process with the corollary that their relationship is zero-sum in nature. This
ignores how states help to constitute the economy as an object of regulation and the extent
to which even economic globalization continues to depend on politics. For the capital relation
is constitutively incomplete and needs extra -economic supplementation if the inherently
improbable process of accumulation is to continue. States are heavily involved in this
supplementation both directly and through their modulation of other extra-economic modes
of regulation; and their equally improbable capacity to achieve this depends in part on
revenues and resources derived from the accumulation process. In short, state-economy
relations inevitably involve reciprocal interdependence, prompt attempts at strategic
coordination, and produce structural coupling. It cannot be understood in zero-sum terms.
Attempts to do so also ignore the complexities of globalization. Not only are many states
actively involved in constituting the conditions for globalization, which is multiform and hence
contested, but globalization is also linked to processes on other scales, such as
regionalization, triadization, international localization, and cross-borderization, and states
engage in promoting/resisting these processes too. Finally, zero-sum analyses ignore the
extent to which the unfolding economic logic (and illogic) of globalization can constrain firms
as well as political actors.</p>
      <p>This leads us to a third area of conceptual confusion: the claim that globalization puts
pressure on the sovereign state. This is misleading for four reasons. First, sovereignty is only
one aspect of the form of the modern state. As a specific juridico-political form, sovereignty
certainly organizes key features of state power; but it is struggles over state power that are
ultimately primary, not the particular forms in which it is exercised. Forms of sovereignty have
been reorganized in the past and a post-sovereign international system is imaginable.
Second, it is not the State as such (sovereign or otherwise) that is pressured by
globalization. The processes that generate globalization can only put pressure on particular
forms of state with particular state capacities and liabilities, such as the Keynesian Welfare
National State in Atlantic Fordism or the Listian Workfare National State in East Asian
Exportism.2 In so doing, it also modifies the balance of forces within states. For any
differential loss of capacities will favour some fractions, classes, and social forces over
others; it also creates space for, and prompts, struggles to reorganize state forms and
capacities. Important aspects of such pressures are the acceleration of economic
decisionmaking and temporal compression of significant economic events relative to the time
required for considered political decision-making. This weakens what one might call the ‘time
sovereignty’ of the state in its current form. Third, since globalization is not a single causal
mechanism with a universal, unitary logic but is multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, and
multiform, it does not generate a single, uniform set of pressures. All states and state
capacities will be pressured by globalization but each will be affected in different ways.
Indeed, while some states actively promote globalization, others can be seen as its victims.
Thus, even if one agreed that globalization mainly means Americanization, the ‘Great Satan’
would still experience pressures emanating from other centres and forms of globalization as
well as from the internal impact of its own neo -liberal form and the resistance it inevitably
generates at home and abroad. Similar arguments hold for the differential impact of the
multiscalar nature of globalization, with states being differentially involved in various scalar
projects and processes; and about that of its multitemporal nature, with some states more
actively involved in and/or more vulnerable to time-space distantiation and compression.
And, fourth, we should note that some aspects of globalization might actually enhance rather
than diminish state capacities.</p>
      <p>Having clarified possible misconceptions, we can now consider how (national) states are
involved in, and affected, by globalization. In broad terms, states are actively engaged in
redrawing the spatio-temporal matrices within which capital operates. In doing so, they are
trying to manage the tension between potentially mobile capital’s interests in reducing its
place-dependency and/or liberating itself from temporal constraints, on the one hand, and,
on the other hand, their own interest in fixing (allegedly beneficial)3 capital within their own
territories and rendering capital’s temporal horizons and rhythms compatible with their statal
and/or political routines, temporalities, and crisis-tendencies. For, as globalization increases,
national states can no longer presume, as they did in the heyday of Atlantic Fordism, that
their primary economic task is to govern a relatively closed national economy – instead they
are increasingly involved in managing a range of transnational processes and creating the
spatial and temporal fixes appropriate thereto. Of particular importance here is the changing
relationship between the economic and the extra-economic factors bearing on
competitiveness and states’ own role in redefining the boundaries between the economic
and extra-economic and/or reorganizing the latter and subordinating them to the perceived
demands and pressures of globalization. Thus, to take a paradoxical example, even as
neoliberal states seem to disengage from the market economy, they intervene more in the
extraeconomic field and subordinate it to the demands of valorization.</p>
      <p>More generally, the activities of capitalist states, almost regardless of their specific form and
projects, have been reshaping the spatio-temporal matrices of globalization. Their roles here
reflect the balance of internal and external forces, with some more willing and active
participants in these processes than others. Nonetheless, among many relevant activities,
we can mention: deregulating, liberalizing, and shaping the institutional architecture of

finance, facilitating thereby its accelerating internationalization and its global acceleration;
modifying institutional frameworks for international trade and foreign direct investment;
planning and subsidizing the spatial fixes that support the activities of financial, industrial,
and commercial capital within and across borders; promoting uneven development through
policies for inter-urban and inter -regional as well as international competition; cooperating in
the rebordering and rescaling of state functions – including decentralization and cross-border
region formation, regional bloc formation, and participating in forums for inter-triad
negotiation; de-statizing current state functions by transferring them to private-public
partnerships or place-bound market forces and thereby linking them to market -oriented
temporalities; de-territorializing some state functions by transferring them to private forms of
functional authority (including international regimes) and/or to mobile market forces;
attempting, conversely, to fit some non-territorial problems into an areal structure (e.g.,
making national states responsible for enforcing international agreements on global
warming); and, finally, addressing the multiformity of globalization processes by engaging in
the struggle to define the rules for harmonizing or standardizing a wide range of
technological, economic, juridico-political, socio-cultural, and environmental issues.
More specifically, given the multicentric and multiform nature of globalization, some states
are committed to promoting their own national or regional capitalisms and the appropriate
conditions for the expanded reproduction of these forms of capitalism on a global scale. The
neo-liberal project has, of course, been most successful in this regard in the past two
decades; but it has not gone uncontested and the European model in particular may regain
ground in the coming decade. They are also establishing new scales of activity (and
dismantling others) and thereby rescaling and re-articulating various state powers,
institutional forms, and regulatory capacities and creating the possibility for themselves and
other actors to ‘jump scales’ in response to specific problems. They are promoting the space
of flows by organizing conditions favourable to the international mobility of technologies,
industrial and commercial capital, intellectual property, and at least some types of labour
power. And, conversely, they are engaged in complementary forms of Standortpolitik and
other forms of place-based competition in the attempt to fix mobile capital in their own
economic spaces and to enhance the inter-urban, inter-regional, or international
competitiveness of their own place-bound capitals.</p>

    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>6. Globalization, Time, and the State</title>
      <p>
        An important source of pressure on states comes from the growing complexity of the political
economy of time and its implications for politics as the ‘art of the possible’. States
increasingly face temporal pressures in their policy-making and implementation due to new
forms of time-space distantiation, compression, and differentiation. For, as the temporalities
of the economy accelerate relative to those of the state, the time to determine and
coordinate political responses to economic events shrinks – especially in relation to superfast
and/or hypermobile capital. This reinforces conflicts between the time(s) of the state and the
time(s) of the market. One solution to the state’s loss of time sovereignty is laissez-faire. This
approach reinforces the temporality of deregulated exchange-value, however, which
becomes problematic when market forces provoke economic crises and states are expected
to respond. Two other options are for states to try to compress their own decision-making
cycles so that they can make more timely and appropriate interventions and/or to attempt to
decelerate the activities of ‘fast capitalism’ to match existing political routines.
A strategy of temporal compression increases pressures to make decisions on the basis of
unreliable information, insufficient consultation, lack of participation, etc., even as state
managers believe that policy is still taking too long to negotiate, formulate, enact, adjudicate,
determine, and implement. The commitment to ‘fast policy’ is reflected in the shortening of
policy development cycles, fast-tracking decision-making, rapid programme rollout,
continuing policy experimentation, institutional and policy Darwinism, and relentless revision
of guidelines and benchmarks. This privileges those who can operate within compressed
time scales, narrows the range of participants in the policy process, and limits the scope for
deliberation, consultation, and negotiation. This can significantly affect the choice of policies,
the initial targets of policy, the sites where policy is implemented, and the criteria adopted to
demonstrate success. It also affects whether any lessons learnt are relevant to other targets,
sites, or criteria; and it discourages proper evaluation of a policy’s impact over different
spatio-temporal horizons, including delayed and/or unintended consequences and feedback
effects. In such situations, ‘spin’ trumps substance and modifies the nature of politics and
policy-making. It may also help to accelerate policy-making and implementation cycles so
that different approaches are tried in rapid succession as each is seen to fail. One symptom
of this is the shortening ‘half life’ of legislation and other policies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Scheuerman 2001: 91–2)</xref>
        . It
also produces the dilemma that unchanged policies become irrelevant or even
counterproductive whilst constant changes in policies risk being seen as opportunistic or
illegitimate
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref25">(on the case of law, for example, see de Sousa Santos 1995)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if fast policy appears irrational from a purely policy-making perspective, it may still be
rational for some interests in politics- or polity-making terms. For fast policy is antagonistic to
corporatism, stakeholding, the rule of law, formal bureaucracy, and, indeed, to the routines
and cycles of democratic politics more generally. It privileges the executive over the
legislature and the judiciary, finance over industrial capital, consumption over long -term
investment. In general, resort to fast policy undermines the power of decision-makers who
have long decision-taking cycles – because they lose the capacity to make decisions in
terms of their own routines and procedures, having to adapt to the speed of the fast policy
takers. It also tends to destroy institutional memory, on the grounds that new circumstances
require new approaches, and to block efforts to anticipate future difficulties and policy
failures. Hence the present is extended at the expense of both past and future and politics is
lived in the mediatized world of spin and presentation, the quick fix, rapid churning of
policies, and plebiscitarian democracy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref21 ref4 ref8">(cf. Chesneaux 2000; Hoogerwoof 1990; Santiso and
Schedler 1998; for a possible counter-argument that simplistic, short-term, populist ‘spin’ by
a charismatic leader is a useful complement to – or front for – more complex, medium - to
long-term, behind-the-scenes policy-making lobbying, negotiation, policy-making, see
Grande 2000)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        An alternative strategy is not to compress absolute political time but to create relative
political time by slowing the circuits of capital. Perhaps the most celebrated, if not yet
implemented, example of this strategy is the Tobin tax, which would decelerate the flow of
superfast and hypermobile financial capital and limit its distorting impact on the real economy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref4">(see Jetin and de Brunhoff 2000)</xref>
        . Other examples include an energy tax on fossil fuels and
nuclear power, consistent introduction of the polluter pays principle on a global scale, resort
to a worldwide prudential principle in the introduction of new technologies, and inclusion of
recycling and disposal costs in pricing goods
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Altvater and Mahnkopf 1999)</xref>
        . For these could
tilt the balance away from globalization in favour of regional and local economies, slow the
rate of environmental destruction, and allow proper evaluation of the likely consequences of
technological innovation. This could be supplemented by a fourth political time-management
option. This is to establish the institutional framework for subsidiaritarian guided
selfregulation on various scales as well as for continuous monitoring of how well such
selfregulation is operating in the light of agreed criteria
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Scheuerman 2001)</xref>
        . This strategy of
reflexive metagovernance would enable the state to retain the capacity to co-ordinate
activities across different time zones and temporalities without the risk of overload
(Hoogerwerf 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, on the temporal front, states are getting involved in promoting new temporal
horizons of action and new forms of temporal flexibility, in coping with the increased salience
of multiple time zones (in commerce, diplomacy, security, etc.), in recalibrating and managing
the intersection of temporalities (e.g., regulating computer-programmed trading, promoting
the 24-hour city as centre of consumption, managing environmental risk), and socializing
long-term conditions of production as short -term calculation becomes more important for
marketized economic activities. Of particular importance is the restructuring of welfare
regimes to promote flexible economic and social adjustment and socialize its costs as
economies become more vulnerable to the cyclical fluctuations and other vagaries of the
world market
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Jessop 1999b, 1999c)</xref>
        . Such a welfare orientation was always a feature of
small open economies but is now becoming more general. For, ‘[t]he more the welfare state
is able to guarantee security and a “future” beyond the market place, the more political space
there is to relax closure vis-a-vis world markets’

      <title>7. Conclusions</title>
      <p>
        I will draw two sets of conclusions. The first set concerns globalization and time. I hope to
have shown that globalization is not just a spatial or scalar phenomenon; it is also temporal.
It is best studied in terms of differential articulation of time -space distantiation and
timespace compression and their repercussions on power relations and social dynamics. Indeed,
insofar as globalization is linked to the logics of capital accumulation, time is more significant
than space – because accumulation rests on ‘economy of time’. Global capitalism weakens
national states through its adverse impact on their claims to time sovereignty as well as to
territorial sovereignty. This suggests the need to reorganize the spatio-temporal fixes within
which moments of relative structural coherence and stability can occur through the
displacement and/or deferral of certain of the contradictions and dilemmas of capitalism
beyond the spatio-temporal horizons with which that fix is associated. But it also means that
there can never be global stability or an unlimited process of global accumulation in an
undifferentiated world market. For spatio-temporal pockets of stable capital accumulation
rests on specific spatio-temporal fixes. This is never a global stability – it is always
spatialized, temporalized, and differential. This in turn implies that attempts to control the
globalization of the capital relation entail control over its temporalities as well as its
spatialities. As well as thinking global, acting local, we must also think glacial, act everyday.
This brings me to the second set of conclusions, concerning the role of the state in
constituting these socio-spatial fixes and managing the temporalities as well as spatialities of
capital accumulation. The national state has long played a key role in establishing and
regulating the relationship between the spatial and the temporal matrices of social life
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Poulantzas, 1978: 114)</xref>
        . This remains true in a period of globalization but the forms in which
the state is involved therein have been changing. For the state is involved in modifying the
spatio-temporal matrices of capitalism and the nation; and it has a key role in managing the
uneven spatio-temporal development engendered by the capital relation. In many significant
respects the processes that produce globalization have undermined the effectiveness of the
national state (in its postwar forms) because specific powers and capacities have become
less relevant to the new spatio-temporal matrices, the reversal of the relative significance of
wages as cost of production and source of demand and of money as national money and
international currency as these functioned in Atlantic Fordism, and the increased significance
of competition and state forms as sites of contradictions and dilemmas in a globalizing,
knowledge-driven economy (see Jessop 2002). Nonetheless a restructured national state
remains central to the effective management of the emerging spatio-temporal matrices of
capitalism and the emerging forms of post- or transnational citizenship to be seen in
multiethnic, multicultural, melting pot, tribal, cosmopolitan, ‘playful’ pos tmodern, and other
identities. For national states have become even more important arbiters of the movement of
state powers upwards, downwards, and sideways; they have become even more important
meta-governors of the increasingly complex multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, and
multiform world of governance; and they are actively involved in shaping the forms of
international policy regimes. They are also responding to the crisis in traditional forms and
bases of national citizenship. Their activities in these respects have far less to do with
globalization in the strongest sense of this polyvalent, promiscuous, and controversial word
(i.e., the emergence of a borderless planetary economy – an entity widely and rightly
regarded as mythical) than they do with the more general spatio-temporal restructuring of
contemporary capitalism. This is why my own discussion of globalization has focused on the
complex spatio-temporal logics of globalization and their manifold implications for state
power. In doing so I hope to have contributed in a small way to demystifying globalization
and illustrating the ways in which its associated spatio-temporal transformations can be
modified and controlled.
