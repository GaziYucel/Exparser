        <p>Over the last two decades, the Mbororo - a “marginal” ethnic group - have experienced some unexpected rewards due to a new policy in Cameroon's West Region. Among the changes that affected the Mbororo were the following: a new legal-institutional framework (the 1996 Constitution), the consequences of the multi-party competition since 1990, and the mobilisation outside of political parties in the framework of an association for the promotion of ethnic interests (the MBOSCUDA, founded 1992).

      <p>
        Over the past two decades, the Mbororo, a “marginal” ethnic group,
according to the official terminology,1 experienced unexpected recognition
due to political factors in the West Region of Cameroon. The causes and
consequences of this profound change are largely unknown. The on-going
debate (sometimes accompanied by violence) on the link between
citizenship and autochthony first appears rather disadvantageous for a group as
unstable as the Mbororo. But the state-sponsored policy of settlement,
initially viewed with suspicion, has affected the Mbororo favourably, especially
since it was associated with better schooling, producing a critical mass of
“elites”. There was a Mbororo “political awakening” in the context of
changes in areas including but not limited to the following: the effects of a
new legal-institutional framework
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(the 1996 Constitution)</xref>
        , the consequences
of competition between political parties since 1990 (even in a system that is
far from being a democracy), and mobilisation outside of political parties by
the Mbororo Social and Cultural Development Association of Cameroon
(MBOSCUDA), since 1992.
      </p>
      <p>This matter merits reflection when one considers that under the
singleparty system (1966–1990/91), the Mbororo, semi-settled Fulani herdsmen,
had always maintained a distance vis-à-vis the Cameroonian state: Their
contact with the administration was for a long time limited to simply paying
tax on livestock. Apart from this, the Cameroonian government did not
need the Mbororo. In turn, the Mbororo did not need the state (Davis 1995:
1</p>
      <p>
        The term “marginal” refers to the people who are distinguished by their way of life,
characterised mainly by the physical instability (nomadic, semi-nomadism or
transhumance) and the extreme precariousness of their material condition, which
reduces them to a situation of extreme dependence on their natural environment
(forests, pastures, etc.). They generally live by hunting, fishing, gathering, or barter,
and sometimes engage in subsistence farming using the most rudimentary
techniques
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref2">(Donfack Sokeng 2001: 113, see Barbier 1981: 239-260)</xref>
        . The Mbororo and
the Pygmies have been identified by the United Nations and by themselves as
“indigenous peoples”, i.e., communities who have in common, in principle, historical
continuity with a specific region before colonisation and a close relationship with
their land; they maintain at least in part, separate social, economic and political
systems. They have different languages, cultures, beliefs and knowledge systems and
are determined to preserve and develop their identity and separate institutions.
They also form a non-dominant, marginalised and discriminated sector within
society
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(Shulte-Tenckhof 1997)</xref>
        . But in Cameroon, as elsewhere in Africa, the situation
is complicated by the fact that the United Nations and its Working Group on
Indigenous Peoples adopted the concept of “autochtone” as the official translation of
“indigenous” (indigène). However, it has a very different meaning than the word
“autochtone” has in Francophone countries, where autochthones are rarely
marginal groups but rather dominant groups that control the state
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(see Geschiere
2009)</xref>
        .
220). But since the return to multi-party politics in 1990, the masquerade of
electoral competition and the pursuit of electoral votes made the Mbororo
attractive to candidates, in contrast to the situation during to the single-party
period, when the Mbororo hardly ever voted.
      </p>
      <p>How deep does this political participation run? What are the key criteria
for success? These are the main framing questions of this analysis, which
originated from the work I have been carrying out for quite some time in
the West Region on the dominant groups, the Bamun and Bamileke. I
realised recently that research on dominant groups is incomplete without
looking at the dominated groups, the ethnic minorities, on a sub-national level.
This shift of attention has required a degree of openness regarding the
interaction between Mbororo and “native” farmers, be they dominant or in a
minority position. In this way, my approach was exploratory. To achieve
these goals, I used three research techniques: I examined written sources and
conducted both interviews and focus group discussions.</p>
      <p>First, I consulted written sources, which consisted of literature (books,
newspapers, magazine articles, Internet sources, etc.) on the Mbororo and
the surrounding farming groups: the Bamun, the Bamileke, the Tikar, and
others. While consulting Internet sources, I found that the assumed
marginality of the Mbororo clashed with the high public exposure of their
problems in these various media. Primary sources consisted of papers issued by
the Mbororo themselves, essentially MBOSCUDA documents, which I
accessed through administrative and municipal archives. The research,
carried out by way of semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions,
led me to several other localities in the West, and more broadly in Noun
Division, where the concentration of Mbororo is highest. I also conducted
interviews with Mbororo residents and many elites in Yaoundé, the capital
of Cameroon, and in the city of Jakiri in the Northwest Region, with the aim
of obtaining data for comparison. The focus group discussions were
conducted with Mbororo “elites” (administrative, political and traditional) and
many ordinary citizens among the farmer groups.</p>
      <p>In the following, I will first describe the socio-political context, then
successively analyse the degree of political participation of the Mbororo in
the West Region, the determinants of participation and, finally, their political
awakening, from a comparative perspective.2

      <title>A Favourable Pastoral Environment,</title>
      <p>
        a “Marginal” People
Western Cameroon is an area dominated by two ethnic groups: the Bamileke
and Bamun. The Bamileke are grouped into seven divisions (Bamboutos,
Upper Nkam, the Upper Plateau, Kung-Khi, Menoua, Mifi, and Nde) and
one hundred chiefdoms. In those divisions, the density reaches more than
200 inhabitants per square kilometre. The Bamun kingdom itself keeps the
same boundaries as Noun Division, covering an area of 7,687 square
kilometres, or 55.35 per cent of the West Region
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(see Mouiche 2005: chap. 2)</xref>
        .
Apart from these two dominant groups, the region’s population is made up
of eight sizeable ethnic minorities that can be grouped into two categories:
The first is made up of ethnic groups previously established and residing in
the Bamileke-dominated area: the Mbo, the Banen, the Bakua, the Dibum
(or Yabassi); in the Bamun land we find the Tikar. The second group is
formed out of “late-comers”, groups that arrived even after the Europeans:
the Poakam in the Bamun land,3 and the Mbororo, found in both the
Bamun and Bamileke highlands.
      </p>
      <p>The Hegemony of the “Native Farmers”
In Cameroon, the relationship between the government and pastoralists is
almost always characterised by – mostly failing – settlement policies. Among
the exceptions is the case of the Mbororo who inhabit the West Region. The
high plateaus and wet vegetation dominated by grasslands are quite suitable
for pastoral activities. Nomadism was abandoned when the population
anchored itself at its wintering site and adopted a transhumance practice, the
cattle breeders delegating more and more of their flocks to third parties.
How did the Mbororo become sedentary? Among the geographical features
that made the lifestyle transition at all possible, the altitude seems to play the
most important role: The wintering sites are frequently above 1,500 meters,
an altitudinal threshold that changes the cultural conditions. The settlement
was also the result of an authoritative policy of the administration associated
with improved pastures.4

      <p>The Pouakam arrived in the late 1960s in the Bamun kingdom, well after the
Mbororo (and post-colonially), but they have acquired the status of native.
On the process and impact of settlement on the Western Mbororo, see John
Boutrais (1984: 225-256).</p>
      <p>
        Though the natural features of the West Region are very suitable for
cattle breeding, the socio-political context is disadvantageous for the
Mbororo. Indeed, farmers exert an unchallenged supremacy over breeders.
This is first of all due to a numerical supremacy but also a political
supremacy in the broadest sense. Most of the West, particularly the Bamileke
Plateau, is more or less reserved for farmers whose settlements have population
densities of 200 to 300 inhabitants (or more) per square kilometre. The
result is that land for cattle grazing comprises less than 10 per cent of the
area of the country. Land saturation and the increase of cultivated areas have
prevented the expansion of livestock. There are few areas left for breeding
in Bana, the Bamboutos Mountains and the Galim area. Pastures in the
Bamboutos Mountains are considered the largest and richest in Bamileke
country, one reason the colonial authorities reserved their exclusive use for
European cattle breeders
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref8">(see Champaud 1983: 321; Fark-Grüninger 1995:
111)</xref>
        . The population density in rural Bamun is much lower, ranging
between 20 to 40 people per square kilometre. However, this occupancy rate is
hardly suitable for extensive livestock farming. But as the cultivation areas
are not equally distributed, some open lands remain available to pastoralists.
It is due to the advantages of this region of Bamun that the Mbororo have
established many colonies there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difficulties of the Mbororo are related not only to their minority
status but also to the recentness of their settling, to which the “native”
farmers have reacted negatively. Here it may be useful to pose a few simple
questions: Are the Mbororo regarded in the West (by the Bamileke, Bamun,
Mbo, Tikar, farmers, etc.) as autochthons? Do they enjoy full citizenship
rights? What about their official recognition as “indigenous people” in
Cameroon? Let us start with a related reflection: The situation in the West
Region is broadly comparable to that of the neighbouring English-speaking
Northwest Region, which is better studied
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref32 ref5">(see Duni et al. 2009; Pelican
2008: 540-560; Boutrais 1984: 225-256)</xref>
        . Indeed, there is no documented,
historical, pre-colonial continuity of the Mbororo in any part of today’s
West and Northwest Regions of Cameroon. As pastoralists, they have never
considered buying and thus owning their grazing lands, so in the absence of
territoriality they are considered “migrants” – and in a more negative sense
they are considered “strangers” by neighbouring farmers, who see
themselves as “landowners” and the Mbororo as their “guests”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(see Pelican 2008:
540-560)</xref>
        . To put it simply, the contrasts between the two groups are strong:
The farmers are subsumed under the broader Bantu culture, while the
Mbororo relate to the Fulani cultures that are scattered across the Sahel
lands of West Africa. The divergence of economic interests between the two
populations always manifests itself in a latent (though at times open)
conflict. The most common causes of confrontations are the extension of
settlements at the expense of pastureland, and the damage caused to land and
property by herds.

        <title>Socio-political Development</title>
        <p>
          By observing the extent of the Mbororo ethno-cultural area, one quickly
detects a lack of social infrastructure, especially in health and education
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref6">(see
Salé 1991; Burnham 1996; Duni et al. 2009)</xref>
          . All children (girls and boys)
have a Quranic education, and almost all acquire a good command of the
Quran before the age of fourteen, a feat that is due to the inexpensive
nature of this education and how well suited it is to the kind of life the
Mbororo lead. However, there is a problem in terms of “modern” basic
education: According to a study conducted by Abouamé Salé on the
Mbororo in Noun Division, only 2 out of 100 Mbororo children attend
school today. Only 3 of every 1,000 students in the Noun are Mbororo, and
girls make up a mere 16 per cent of registered Mbororo schoolchildren; by
high school, this percentage drops to just 12 (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">Salé 1991</xref>
          : 40). The Mbororo
generally have very little access to higher education, with few going beyond
Form 4. Pastoralism requires a lot of constant work by a large number of
people; even school-age children are often needed.
        </p>
        <p>Administratively, the relations between the Mbororo and the
Cameroonian state remain remote. This verbal attack made by the senior
divisional officer of Bui, Northwest Region, in a meeting with the Mbororo
sums up their complex and ambiguous relationship:</p>
        <p>You Mbororo people are tearing yourselves apart instead of coming
together like the rest of Cameroon. You call yourselves an abandoned
people? Who abandoned you? You abandoned yourselves! Keeping
away from others, keeping away from me! How do you expect me to
understand you when you keep away from me, keep away from others
when we are all here in the towns and you remain away from us, away
from everything, away from me – up in the hills out there in the
Bush!5
Moreover, taking advantage of the low level of education of many Mbororo,
some officials are harming Mbororo interests. In the interviews, the
Mbororo voiced a whole string of complaints against the administration. A
female Mbororo informant enumerated some of the most frequently
occurring issues they have to deal with: intimidation; harassment; extortion of
money; abusive corporal punishment by gendarmes; and unfair trials of
agro-pastoral conflicts (the farmer systematically winning against the
disarmed and helpless Mbororo), etc. “These greedy and heartless people
consider the Mbororo their breastfeeders, or merely plantations from which
they can draw their pensions!” said our female informant. “To satisfy their
predatory instinct, they sometimes do not hesitate to ask for non-existing
official documents, or to invoke unknown provisions in Cameroonian law.”6</p>
        <p>Politically, the Mbororo are generally characterised by their apathy,
acknowledged as much within the communities as outside of them. As one
Mbororo informant said, “It is not fair to say that a man from the Mbororo
is addicted to fighting [political rivals]. He talks about ‘plotique’ to mean
bribery, lying, plots and so on.” This complements the view held by the
nonMbororo. A Mbo informant of Santchou describes the Mbororo
stereotypes: “They are more interested in trade. [...] They do not take part in
meetings and do not complain. They are not ambitious because of their lack
of education.” And finally, this Tikar of Magba said: “No Mbororo is
included on our list [Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (RDPC)
Magba].7 They have little interest in politics but vote RDPC. [...] When
putting together our lists of candidates, those who demand to be taken into
account are the Yamba, Musgum, Arabs and Kotoko.”8 In addition,
Mbororo society is not centralised but rather built on the basis of small clan
units led by ardos (heads). These ardos appear nowhere in the organisational
charts of the administration (which do, however, include other traditional
authorities). In other words, they are not notable among the local chiefs, let
alone “chiefs of the third degree”, like all the village leaders. Even worse for
the Mbororo, an ardo, no matter how important, remains under the authority
of the “native” village chief of the respective territorial administrative unit.</p>

        <p>
          This analysis, however, should not obscure critical milestones in the process
of national integration achieved through the Mbororo’s settlement and
especially the abandonment of some aspects of their previous lifestyle. Some
of these milestones are in the field of education, in the establishment of
technical services (see
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">Salé 1991</xref>

significant changes in both its architecture and its architects. We should also
not forget the not-too-distant past, when the construction of family housing
was done exclusively by women while the men went about their pastoral
occupations. In more concrete terms, one finds in today’s Didango, the
“capital of the Mbororo in Noun Division” and the only settlement where
the Mbororo have left the bush to settle completely, the existence of
“mixed” marriages between the Mbororo and the Bamun. Here, Mbororo
are landowners, and this is recognised by their neighbours (the Bamun). In
Didango, the Mbororo engage in agriculture alongside their pastoral
activities. Furthermore, along with the presence of Mbororo intellectual elites,
one also notes the emergence of a bourgeois capitalist elite that stands out
from the group through its participation in the modern sectors of the
economy (hardware, food, transportation) in nearby city centres such as
Koutaba, Foumbot, Foumban and Bafoussam.</p>
        <p>
          What is striking about these social dynamics is the emergence and the
gradual establishment of private property. The nouveau riche gradually
integrate themselves into the field of the modern capitalist economy and are
vectors of change in their community, a fact observable in the possession of
real assets and access to food, water and electricity. The nouveau riche are
also factors of “social reproduction”, as they initiate their children into this
area and send them to schools and specialised training centres; under this
lies a sense of class consciousness, a logic of conservation, capable of
sustaining social relationships based on a vision of their integration into the
capitalist market society. Citizens with low or precarious social and
economic positions have a relatively low propensity to participate
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Mayer and
Perrineau 1992: 23, 29)</xref>
          . Following the progressive effects of schooling,
members of the Mbororo community have increasingly acquired positions in
the administration of Cameroon (see Table 1). And in the context of the
neopatrimonial Cameroon of today, to be a member of the administration is
a good starting point for any strategy to occupy political space.

      <title>Participation</title>
      <p>We have explored the Western Mbororo’s ethnographic and socio-political
environment; we will now discuss their political participation in this new
context of political liberalisation. We noted above how difficult it was for
them to vote under the one-party system; however, we must not forget that
despite their political apathy in the implementation of the government’s
policy of national integration, the Mbororo had for a long time been
associated with the structures of the single party. This explains why, before 1990,
two of their localities (Yolo and Didango) were provided with a local
committee of the UNC,9 then the RDPC, in the Bamun kingdom.10 However,
there was no Mbororo representation at the upper level (sub-section and
section) despite the unsuccessful attempts, the first of their kind, of Yerima
Dairou and Lerah Amadou of Didango, to win the respective sub-section
presidencies of the RDPC (adult branch of the party) and the OJRDPC
(youth organisation) in 1987. It is thus clear that this structural assimilation
of the Mbororo by the UNC-RDPC was, after all, marginal since they were
not vested with power in the higher echelons of the party hierarchy.</p>

        Lester W.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">Milbrath (1965</xref>
        : 18) has attempted to sketch out ranking
indices of political participation in which the holder of an electoral mandate is
supposed to have covered all the other steps. But keeping in mind this
problem of “political participation” – which, in describing the hierarchy of
forms of political intervention, posits the existence of a continuum from
voting to the exercise of state power – it is important to note fragmentation
imposed by the division of political labour between the agents of the
political sphere and other social agents. Thus, reading the political sections of
newspapers, listening to political broadcasts on television and the radio, and
engaging in political discussions does not involve any participation in the
struggle for leadership positions in the state apparatus. These are in fact
signs of the attention paid to political events by people who can only be
considered spectators. The same logic can be applied to the case of a person
whose vote expresses a desire for social conformity. In contrast, actually

activities not only because they are believed to be time-consuming; these are
activities that belong to other fields of social practice, usually performed by
professionals or social agents whose lives revolve around politics

        .
      </p>
      <p>Some questions emerge regarding the political participation of the
Mbororo: Unlike in the period of the single party, do multi-partyism and
political liberalisation now allow for the emergence of Mbororo candidates
in the national representative institutions? If so, what will the results be?
From the perspective of leadership, do the Mbororo have leaders and
political entrepreneurs likely to mobilise them? To what extent do they exercise
responsibility within political parties, both ruling and oppositional? Since the
first pluralist municipal elections, in 1996, more and more Mbororo have
competed for council positions and some have even managed to get elected.
Based on our field surveys, this political participation manifested itself, for
example, by the presence of 14 Mbororo candidates in the 2007 municipal
elections in the West, related to three political parties. Seven of those 14
were elected: one from the RDPC, the ruling party, two from the Social
Democratic Front (SDF), and four from the Union Démocratique du
Cameroun (UDC). Even more important, a Mbororo, Lerah Adamou of Didango,
became town councillor in Bafoussam, the regional metropolis, under the
aegis of the SDF. A closer inspection of the political participation of the
Mbororo in Noun Division is needed as they constitute here the largest
component of Mbororo in the West Region. Of particular importance is the
political career of Yerima Dairou, an elite Mbororo from Didango, who has
since died. In his day, he succeeded in mobilising his fellow Mbororo so that
they could play their part in the new political context.</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Yerima Dairou and the Political Mobilisation of Mbororo</title>
        <p>Upon the restoration of multi-partyism, the Mbororo of the Noun under the
leadership of Yerima Dairou, then a member of the Central Committee of
the UNDP (National Union for Democracy and Progress), were first
involved in the ranks of this party – the party of their “brother”, Bouba Bello
Maigari, a Fulani from the North and former prime minister of Cameroon.
Having been able to unite and mobilise the electorate around him, Yerima
Dairou became the undisputed political leader of the Mbororo in the Noun
and even in the West. In the legislative elections of 1992, he led the UNDP
list in the Noun, and the Mbororo voted overwhelmingly for this party.
With this allegiance, which combines ethnicity (Fulani) and political coalition
with the UNDP in a division controlled by the UDC party, the Mbororo
face off with the Bamun, most of whom are part of the UDC and the
administration allied with the ruling party, the RDPC. One Mbororo informant
claimed that for the Bamun, the Mbororo are only “strangers and enemies
to kill” and thus that it is necessary for the Bamun “to burn down [the
Mbororo’s] settlements, to destroy their pastures and to expel them from
the Noun”. As a result, the agro-pastoral conflicts are politicised and
sometimes result in the deaths of Mbororo men and the destruction of pastures.
In some other places, they are simply prohibited access to waterways, the
aim being to prevent their use by livestock. The administration, in turn, has
raised the price for pasture access and even threatened to expel the Mbororo
to elicit their allegiance to the RDPC.</p>
        <p>In 1995, the administration was also making use of its cunning. In the
hopes of getting Yerima Dairou to return to the ruling party, the
administration agreed to appoint him village chief of Didango, a position his
followers believed for quite some time he should have already held. The timing
was not fortuitous. Because as village chief he would become an auxiliary of
the territorial administration and could not continue to alienate the
administration by remaining in the opposition (the UNDP), he had to return to his
previous benefactor and support the RDPC. Moreover, almost all traditional
leaders in this division are committed to the cause of the RDPC, starting
with the most prominent of them, the sultan of the Bamun. In fact, Yerima
Dairou henceforth called himself “lamido” (like the Fulani chiefs in
Northern Cameroon) and joined the ruling party. But as the Bamun majority are
committed to the UDC and fiercely oppose the RDPC, the Mbororo are still
caught between a rock and a hard place: the UDC and the RDPC.</p>
        <p>Anxious to protect their interests, of which the most important is
access to pastureland, the Mbororo in Noun organised themselves strategically
between allegiance to the UDC and the RDPC. In the 1996 municipal
elections, there were Mbororo candidates in the ruling party and the opposition
party. Seeing as how the UDC enjoy majority support in the Noun, the
Mbororo had believed that their support of the UDC would benefit them in
the fight against poverty, but that turned out to be an illusion.</p>
        <p>Confronted with this misfortune, the Mbororo – while keeping a small
reserve of opposition in order to keep on good terms with their farming
Bamun neighbours – became a source of votes mainly for the RDPC, the
party they perceived as being more responsive to their needs and
requirements. “The Mbororo support the ruling party because its supporters deal in
achievements and not promises,” says one Mbororo interviewee. According
to another interviewee, the UDC does not go deep enough in its diagnosis
to address the problems of the Mbororo in the Noun; this party is not aware
of the specific problems of this community. Yet, according to the same
interviewee, “There is a Mbororo problem in this terroir.” As for the RDPC,
it is popularly associated with the intervention of the state apparatus. “The
administration opens schools, as they did in Yolo and Mbororo-Koutaba.
We have three schools with teachers and at least one headmaster.”11 In the
health field, the creation of health centres has facilitated access to health
care. The opposition criticises, opposes and proposes but is powerless to put
their policies into practice. The same interviewee from above says that “it is
better to [join] the ruling party, which deals in achievements”. The
administrative authority recognises this marriage of convenience between the ruling
party and the Mbororo:</p>
        <p>The Mbororo vote for the RDPC because in their eyes the regime is
seen as a liberator – with the [new] constitution [promoted by the
ruling party] that recognises their rights as a minority. In addition,
they have to safeguard their interests well protected by the regime. [...]
When one is carrying a tray of eggs, one doesn’t look for a fight! They
play an important part in the economy, which is in their interest to
safeguard.</p>
        <p>Before his death, it was common to see Yerima Dairou at meetings of the
South-Central Noun Section of the RDPC in Koutaba at the invitation of
the elite in the Bamun RDPC. Each time he attended one of these meetings,
he took the floor to denounce the UDC and its supporters, using
provocative words such as: “In the past, the Bamun said Mbororo were bushmen;
now under the banner of the RDPC, we have come out of the bush into the
light. It is the Bamun who today remain in the shadows with the UDC.” But
the UDC supporters see the Mbororo who support the RDPC as
“mercenaries”, whose support stems only out of the hopes of receiving state
resources (money, food, loincloths, T-shirts, gadgets, etc.). But Yerima Dairou
died in 2004, leaving the Mbororo of Noun Division somewhat orphaned.
Admittedly, the Mbororo have bureaucratic elites, but these are not political
entrepreneurs in the West Region; the political field has been almost
completely saturated with their farming neighbours for decades.</p>

        <p>These polling stations are mono-ethnic; we deliberately chose these because
this fact could well account for the current sympathy for the two main
parties held by the Mbororo. Today, with the routinisation of the multi-party
system, the logic of confrontation has given way to that of adaptation and
even mutual respect between the Mbororo and the Bamun. This extends to
all their farming neighbours in the West, even though cultural stereotypes,
the lack of leadership, and the educational deficit of the Mbororo continue
to marginalise them. The strategic political alignment of previous years has
been succeeded by the vote of convenience. Under these circumstances, the
ruling party has ensured its supremacy in the West. This domination is
illustrated by the existence of specific RDPC cells and certain local committees
in some Mbororo encampments, at least in the Noun, where the low-level
party structures are numerically important (Didango, Kourom, Yolo,
Bagambi). Before 2007, the UDC had a few local committees in two or
three Mbororo encampments in the Noun; now there is only one left (in
Didango), which shares structural features with the RDPC. Our Mbororo
informants from Didango have also commented on how multi-partyism
contributed to the splitting up families and clans within the community, with
bad blood evolving between supporters of opposing parties.</p>
        <p>Where representation in the leadership of political parties is concerned,
there is no Mbororo in the ruling authorities of the UDC or the SDF,
whether at the sub-divisional, divisional or regional level. In the RDPC,
(which has no regional representation), one single Mbororo, Mbounje
Adamou, is a member of the sub-section board in Bagambi in Noun Division.
This figure is astoundingly low considering that there are over one thousand
party members in the whole division. At a higher level, in 2002 another
Mbororo, Ahmet Abdallah, was elected president of the OJRDPC (the
youth branch of the ruling party) for the south-central section of the Noun,
located in Koutaba, beating out a Bamun candidate. Abdallah was re-elected
in 2007, this time by acclamation. He also remains the only Mbororo to
appear on an executive board of an RDPC section in Noun Division, a
division that has six sections and a total of 18 executive boards at the
division level divided among three branches: adults, women and youth. One
must also consider that each of the 18 executive boards has at least 17
members, so the Mbororo representation is insignificant compared to that
of other ethnic communities, native and non-native, especially the Tikar, the
Bamileke and the Northwestern nationals, even though the inclusion of
these groups is based on the ethnic makeup of the districts. However,
Ahmet Abdallah represents a qualitative step in the political representation of
the Mbororo as compared to their representation in the single-party period
when they were represented only at the lower levels of inferior governing
bodies, the cell and the local committee. Even though the RDPC structures
in the Mbororo encampments are mono-ethnic, this is not the case at the
level of higher bodies such as the sub-section and the section. In addition to
this, Ahmet Abdallah theoretically runs a multi-ethnic structure, although in
reality it is controlled by the Bamun.</p>

      <title>Determinants of Mbororo Political Participation</title>
      <p>We will now explore the factors that ensured the socio-political mutation of
the Western Mbororo. In this regard, three mutually inclusive factors seem
to be essential: first, a favourable legal and institutional environment;
second, from the perspective of resource mobilisation, MBOSCUDA activism
– a new Mbororo social movement established in 1992 that works toward
the socio-political integration of this community; and finally, the structural
assimilation of ethnic groups into political parties.</p>
      <p>
        Regarding the first factor, according to the legal-institutional
framework, the socio-political integration of minorities goes through a number of
institutional arrangements. From this perspective, respect for minority rights
requires special measures that would create prospects for these groups that
the absolute law of the majority tends to impair; with the principle of “equal
treatment for all”, some minorities always end up in the unfavourable
position of having to defend their interests. This may consist of institutional
engineering in the form of quotas, “affirmative action”, or even special
electoral divisions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(see Safran 1994: 61-80)</xref>
        . For example, electoral
boundaries in the US have often served racial minorities such as African-Americans,
enabling them to constitute on their own an electoral majority in one or
more constituencies. For this reason, after each US census, the courts must
adjust the layout of districts based on demographic trends that have
occurred over the past decade. Pascal Noblet sees in this political practice a
true path to “substantive equality”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(Noblet 1993: 133)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        In Cameroon, the political liberalisation of the 1990s culminated in a
constitutional reform on 18 January 1996, which establishes a decentralised
unitary state, recognises indigenous rights, and protects minorities. The
preamble of the Constitution explicitly states that the state shall ensure the
protection of minorities and shall preserve the rights of indigenous
populations. Moreover, in Section X on regional and local authorities, Article 57 (2)
provides that the Regional Council, the legislative body of the region, “shall
reflect the various sociological components of the region”. Before this
constitutional reform, legislation on the organisation of municipal and legislative
elections passed in the 1990s had already established the requirement of
respect for “various sociological components” in the electoral districts:
Article 5 (4) of Law 91/020 of 16 December 1991, which established the
conditions for the election of MPs to the National Assembly, and Article 3 (2) of
Law 92/002 of 14 August 1992, which set the conditions for the election of
municipal councillors. This notion of “sociological components” essentially
boils down to “various ethnic components of the population”. This is also
the meaning that litigants in Cameroon have given it as part of legal actions
relating to municipal elections since 1996
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(see Donfack Sokeng 2001: 30-31)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>“Democracy”, a term often confused with political liberalisation,
“protects minorities, [and tries] to integrate them. If there were no statutory and
constitutional provisions in their favour, no Mbororo at all would be
represented in City Hall,” a local authority told us in an interview.12 This
sentiment was confirmed by our informant, a member of the Mbororo political
elite: “Democracy strengthens the position of minorities, providing a way
out of their disadvantaged positions. It at least offers them the opportunity
to express themselves. With multi-partyism, we have some municipal
councillors.”13</p>
      <p>
        Regarding the second factor (the new Mbororo social movement,
MBOSCUDA), we refer to resource mobilisation theory, which “shows the
process by which a dissatisfied group assembles and invests resources in
pursuit of its own goals”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(Oberschall 1973: 28)</xref>
        . Mobilisation is an
instrumental activity that is put into action once the goals are set – resources being
defined as the object of this activity. From this perspective, society, as

posed to the field of action, is defined as the environment providing political
agents and social movements the necessary resources for action. “Society
provides the infrastructure used by industries of social movements and
other industries” (Zald and McCarthy 1977: 217).</p>
      <p>
        In the case we are concerned with, and according to the Mbororo
themselves, the MBOSCUDA has done much through its awareness-raising
activities to further the population’s appropriation of their civil and political
rights
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32 ref9">(see Davis 1995: 225 ff.; Pelican 2008: 540-560)</xref>
        . Reportedly, the
MBOSCUDA was particularly helpful in assisting the Mbororo
psychologically. The name “Mbororo” is now accepted and internalised by the
Mbororo themselves whereas before, the term was a pejorative, a source of
frustration, and therefore rejected. The Mbororo previously preferred to be
called Fulani or Fula. The MBOSCUDA also helped to advance education
among the Mbororo. During the phase of awareness-raising, the
MBOSCUDA went everywhere: the hamlets, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.
All occasions were good opportunities to revamp Mbororo self-esteem: a
festive occasion anywhere, or a meeting in a cattle market – in short,
wherever the Mbororo could come together. The MBOSCUDA also relied on
the help and networks of the ardos. The MBOSCUDA urged the Mbororo to
attend school, to be vaccinated, to apply for the national identity card, to
obtain birth and marriage certificates – in short, they were taught their civil
and political rights and all that is inherent in human rights. The
MBOSCUDA has also provided the Mbororo with legal assistance. This
assistance is very salutary; previously when threatened with a lawsuit, a
Mbororo would be so alarmed that s/he would risk all her/his assets to
avoid losing the trial and her/his honour, but now the way of thinking has
changed. The MBOSCUDA also asked them to settle, to modernise stock
farming and to acquire land deeds in order to avoid being at the mercy of
the other farmers, who sometimes produce deeds issued after the settlement
of the Mbororo. The MBOSCUDA provides teaching materials, desks and
chairs in Mbororo schools, along with medical equipment and other
necessary items. Finally, the MBOSCUDA promotes a better recognition of the
Mbororo, in order that they achieve greater visibility and are able to actively
participate in national politics (including by their representation in
government).
      </p>
      <p>The MBOSCUDA thus remains confined to an awareness-raising role
and does not formally associate with political parties.14 But by involving
traditional and administrative authorities (divisional officers and senior
divi14</p>
      <p>However, the MBOSCUDA is still dominated by bureaucratic elites established in
Yaoundé, the seat of the institutions. And these elites support the ruling party.
sional officers) as it does in its meetings, the MBOSCUDA’s presence
guarantees the political integration of the Mbororo. To cite one example, the
Mbororo are included on the lists of candidates for election – with the help
of the administrative authorities, who have the great responsibility of
ensuring the compliance of political parties with the rights of minorities
elaborated in the Constitution. The MBOSCUDA seems even more active
internationally. According to Michaela Pelican,
[The] MBOSCUDA has also been instrumental in redefining Mbororo
national citizenship. Alongside collaborating with international
development agencies, it has created links with transnational human and
minority rights organisations, including Amnesty International,
Survival International, Minority Rights Group International, and the
World Intellectual Property Organization. This international backing
proved vital in contesting human rights abuses committed by state
agents against Mbororo individuals.</p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, in line with the proclamation of the decade of
‘indigenous peoples’ (1995–2004) by the United Nations, [the] MBOSCUDA
promoted the Mbororo as an “indigenous minority” whose cultural
survival had to be protected. [...] In 2005 [the] MBOSCUDA was
granted special consultative status by the Economic and Social Council
of the United Nations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Pelican, 2008: 550-551)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        As we can see, the perspective of resource mobilisation not only affects
partisan and formal political activity, but also helps us analyse the social
movements by giving central importance to their organisational structures,
the strategic interactions between organisations, and the relationship
between organisations or social movements and their environment. It appeals
to rationality and argues that participation in a movement must be
considered rational behaviour just like any other institutional behaviour. In this
regard, it adopts the opposite point of view to that of the classical model,
which considers social movements the effects of failure or malfunction of
the social system. The view adopted here is, on the contrary, based on the
premise that resource mobilisation with the aim of collective action is
problematic and, as such, involves a cost and a benefit for any group wishing to
engage in political action
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Arcand, 2003: 24)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the third factor is structuralism, seen here in terms of
democratic culture within the parties based on Peter M. Leslie’s “structural
assimilation” – that is, the proportional distribution of ethnic groups in the
structures of (the aforementioned) political parties
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Leslie 1969: 422)</xref>
        . It is in
fact the political parties that put into practice the legislative and
constitutional requirements regarding minority rights and “sociological
components” of electoral districts, giving a few places to Mbororo community
members in their organisational structures and their lists of candidates
during the nomination phase of elections. In most cases, it is less the integration
of minorities and more the political parties’ electoral interests that prevail,
the latter being manifested in electoral votes that they either get or expect to
get from the target population. The strategy of “proximity”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">(Stroh 2010)</xref>
        is
obviously central here. On the one hand, the Mbororo are politically
apathetic as we have outlined above. On the other hand, due to their
demographically scattered population, the Mbororo are minorities wherever they
are located in the West and cannot alone influence the outcome of an
election in any locality. From what has been said, the political parties (here the
RDPC, SDF, and UDC) seem to be at the vanguard of democratic
development, as they have ensured the political representation of the Mbororo
despite the latter’s political apathy and demographic weakness.
      </p>
      <p>However, the political parties in the opposition and the one in power
employ different strategies to win Mbororo votes. We noted during some
political meetings in the Noun that on the discursive level, the Mbororo do
not side with the criticism against the regime voiced by the opposition,
knowing that only the ruling party can find solutions to their most
immediate and urgent problems. Taking the case of the Noun, a case that applies to
many other Mbororo localities as well, the Mbororo have over decades of
cohabitation learned the Bamun language, and some Bamun handle Fulani
with the greatest of ease. In setting up lists of candidates, UDC leaders
usually confine themselves to co-opting some Mbororo in their lists through
their network of Bamun “beaters”, especially as there is no primary election
for the nomination of candidates in this party. During the electoral
campaigns, everything takes place in the village market (Bamun market), and
decisions are made in the Bamun language. Of course, care is taken to invite
a Mbororo candidate, to whom of course little attention is paid.
Nevertheless, the UDC does campaign in Didango.</p>
      <p>Concerning the RDPC, the situation is somewhat variable taking into
account the demographic data. Thus, in localities with high Mbororo
concentrations (Bagambi, Didango, Kourom, Yolo, etc.), during electoral
campaigns (legislative, presidential and municipal), officials from the ruling party
generally do well by going to the encampments and communicating with the
Mbororo and their ardos. On such occasions, they no longer speak Bamun,
but rather Fulfulde, even if all the Bamun present do not understand this
language. Latitude is given to the Mbororo to express themselves, to present
their grievances – including their complaints – in the language of their
choice. In turn, RDPC officials take the opportunity to emphasise the
government’s protection of minorities, to which the Mbororo belong, as being a
cornerstone. In areas with low concentrations of Mbororo, it is the same
story as with the UDC: It all takes place in the village market square.</p>

      <title>The Political Participation of Western Mbororo:</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>A Political Awakening?</title>
      <p>
        Unlike in the single-party period, when it was difficult for them even to
vote, it is in terms of “political awakening” that the quantum leap made by
the Mbororo in the West must be described in this new context of political
liberalisation. Nevertheless, this awakening is not unique. Following the
example of the West, the neighbouring Anglophone Northwest is also full
of many Mbororo encampments, and one is struck by some parallels in
terms of their political participation. Like the West, the Northwest is a
region of high plateaus with wet grassland vegetation: ideal pastureland. The
farmers here also hold an unchallenged demographic and political
supremacy over the Mbororo. The West and the Northwest combined constitute
the third-largest area for cattle breeding in Cameroon
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(see Boutrais 1984:
225)</xref>
        . Upon the restoration of multi-partyism, Northwestern Mbororo
supported the UNDP party of Bello Bouba Maigari, though the area was
controlled by the opposition SDF. The crisis and development that followed
were not unlike those experienced in the same period by the Mbororo in
Noun. Only the amplitude of the conflict is different here: The Mbororo
were called upon to defend themselves and they also resorted to violence
against indigenous farmers, supporters of the SDF, as reported by Lucy
Davis:
      </p>
      <p>During the recent changes in the direction of multi-party politics in
Cameroon, many of the Northwest Province Mbororo switched
allegiance from their traditional support of Biya’s ruling CPDM party to
support of the Northern, Muslim politician Bouba Bello, then head of
the UNDP, the third-largest party. […]</p>
      <p>
        During the state of emergency in October 1992, a number of
Mbororo compounds were attacked and burnt, large numbers of
cattle are claimed to have been attacked with machetes. The Mbororo
retaliated on horseback, attacking local villagers with their herding
staffs. Mbororo were not permitted to enter certain market towns and
had to buy their provisions through Hausa middlemen. These events
may indeed have helped lead the Mbororo into a more genuine,
growing movement towards Muslim unity in Northwest Province,
albeit as yet independent from the North
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Davis 1995: 221)</xref>
        .
This tension highlights the ethnic dimension, especially the close
relationship between a feeling of identity, territorial control and political
competition. It raises the fundamental questions of right to the soil, not of a
particular individual, but of a group
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(Pourtier 1998: 139)</xref>
        . But, as has been rightly
seen by Jean-François Bayart, Peter Geschiere and Francis Nyamnjoh, the
political moment when the assertion of autochthony occurs “undoubtedly
remains that of the democratisation of authoritarian regimes and of
authoritarian restoration strategies”, “two quasi-concomitant processes in the
1990s, which, however, should not be confused”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Bayart, Geschiere and
Nyamnjoh 2001: 182-186)</xref>
        . But what is remarkable here is that the
opposition (the SDF in the Northwest and the UDC in Noun) participates in the
same authoritarian prism, by compelling the Mbororo to enrol in those
parties. With the routinisation of the electoral process, the Mbororo of the
Northwest became a source of votes for the RDPC as did the Mbororo of
the West. It is this RDPC–Mbororo alliance that the sub-divisional officer
of Jakiri (division of Bui, Northwest) who we interviewed during the field
surveys called “republican tradition”.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we have shown above that Mbororo society is not welded
or organised by a centralised political structure but rather built on the basis
of small clan units. This in addition to their individualism weakens their
position as a group capable of mobilising. Against this segmental trend,
Yerima Dairou, who was appointed chief of the village of Didango in 1995,
attempted to politically unify the Noun Mbororo and even the Western
Mbororo – a unification modelled on the Fulani lamidates of Northern
Cameroon – and he called himself lamido, thereby the paramount chief of
the ardos. Even though the undertaking was received favourably in Didango,
clan individualism still had too thick a skin among the ardos and the
Mbororo of other camps for all to acknowledge him. Besides, for such a
project to be truly successful, it would need the concomitant endorsement
of the administration and the sultan of Bamum. However, Dairou, as a
lamido – whose purpose is to rule over all the Mbororo in the Noun –
competes with that of the sultan of Bamum, which in the socio-political context
of the Bamun kingdom is unacceptable. Yerima Dairou’s father initially
attempted to get acknowledged by the colonial administration as lamido
(1915–1962), but he gave that pursuit up following independence. Among
other reasons, his decision was borne out of consideration, as no-one in the
kingdom of Bamun should have a power similar to that of the sultan (see

        ). In fact, the so-called “lamidate” of Didango confers only the
status of village chief (third degree), and its sphere of influence is confined
to Didango. Nevertheless, it represents an important reference point in the
traditional local power structure and especially for the inclusion of the
Mbororo. In the Northwest, a similar structure was created in 2001 with
varying degrees of success at Sabga near Bamenda.15
      </p>
      <p>Like in Cameroon’s West, multi-partyism and democratisation have
opened new opportunities for the Mbororo of the Northwest. They are,
more and more, running for positions as municipal councillors and even
managing to win, drawing on the support of the new legal and institutional
architecture in favour of minorities that the MBOSCUDA has long worked
toward. It is not unimportant to note that the national president of the
MBOSCUDA, El Hadj Jaji Manu Gidado, prince of Sagba, is a native of the
Northwest and a high-ranking official (chargé de mission) at the presidency of
the republic. It was in this region in 2007 (and nowhere else in Cameroon to
date) that the Mbororo began to take decisive steps with regard to their
political integration, by registering one of their own in the municipal
executive, the position of third assistant of the mayor in the town of Jakiri, under
the banner of the RDPC. Some Mbororo are also members of the CPDM
sections in the region, youth and adult branches; and in Jakiri, the
vicepresident of the OJRDPC is a Mbororo.</p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of “indigenous peoples”, one notes some
homologies between the Mbororo and the Pygmies of the forest areas of central,
eastern and southern Cameroon. But it is above all the contrasts that prevail.
Like the Mbororo, a few Pygmies are now councillors in the municipalities
of the East and the South even though this was not the case before 2007
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref29 ref39">(see Tchoumba, Guechou Bouopda and Messe 2006; Nke Ndih 2010)</xref>
        .
Obviously, the Pygmies should enjoy the same new legal-institutional
framework as the Mbororo. But this is unfortunately not the case: Without any
educational and intellectual background, Pygmies have no social movement
following the example of the MBOSCUDA, not to mention leaders or
bureaucratic elites. Unlike the Mbororo, who have some economic power
through cattle breeding, the Pygmies rather remain poor “savages”
constantly undermined and exploited by their Bantu neighbours. This
exploitation even borders on slavery and fortunately is constantly denounced by
NGOs. It is these NGOs and the state that are now trying to support the
Pygmies’ participation in several programmes.

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>
        We have just seen that, as long as elections within the one-party system
remained a simple ritual to legitimate rulers, those rulers did not need the
Mbororo; with multi-partyism and democratisation, where balloting changed
from a ritual vote to the process of actually electing rulers, the Mbororo of
the West have become political subjects and actors. And from the vicious
circle under the single party, this community is beginning its transition into
the virtuous circle by exercising its political rights, which were in former
times ignored or denied, and by assuming its citizenship completely as
candidates in the municipal institutions, members of local hierarchies in political
parties, etc. These are the milestones considered from the qualitative – not
the quantitative – perspective that have led us to the conclusion about the
Mbororo political awakening. This transformation, comparable to that of
the Mbororo of the Northwest, is a result of three main factors: first, the
new legal-institutional architecture, which confirms the rights of minorities
and compels the different protagonists of the electoral process to respect
the “various sociological components” of the electoral constituencies;
second, the role of the MBOSCUDA, a new social movement of the Mbororo
that works by raising awareness about how the Mbororo can appropriate
their civil and political rights; and third, the structural assimilation of ethnic
groups by the RDPC, UDC and SDF, which grant certain roles to the
members of this community in the structures of their organisations and their
lists of candidatures during nominations for the municipal elections. This
study highlights the central role of political parties in the social and political
integration of ethnic minorities as well as the role of social movements as
strategic activities for the purpose of entry into the political system and as
activities instrumental to the mobilisation of social groups or individuals
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Lapeyronnie 1988: 593)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>It remains a fact, however, that the Mbororo in the West – as in the
rest of Cameroon – have not yet succeeded in transforming their political
awakening into real political victory; they have not taken over control of
local rule by becoming municipal executives in the region. There is only one
Mbororo deputy mayor in a country comprised of 360 municipalities and
therefore almost one thousand executive posts – this in addition to a “few
representatives in municipal councils that are there to decorate the gallery
and give the impression that they are taken into account” to use Fadimatou
Dahirou’s words. No Mbororo has ever been mayor and as of this moment
the doors of parliament are still closed to the Mbororo, despite the late
Yerima Dahirou of Didango having obtained in 1992 for the first time the
endorsement as parliamentary candidate of the Noun constituency for the
UNDP in the general elections. This experience is slow to repeat itself, and
therefore constitutional democracy is still struggling to truly penetrate the
political field in Cameroon. That is why among their grievances, the
Mbororo voice repeatedly that they want to have a member of their
community appointed either a minister, or a representative in the National
Assembly. The same would hold true for the senate and regional assemblies –
both institutions are stipulated in the constitution but have yet to be created.
The Mbororo are also advancing their demands to have local councillors
and mayors, arguing that they have the necessary “qualifications”. Finally,
there is no space to discuss the role of the arena (regional or national) for
the strategies and constraints of political participation by groups with a
common sense of belonging. We must also consider the contentious
question of whether all described acts of participation and contestation are in the
interests of the group, or simply boil down to an individual’s ambitions. This
contribution has chosen to look at political participation from the
perspective of groups with a sense of common origin to provide a counterweight to
the (dominant) contributions that analyse the strategies of political parties
and “big men”; but these perspectives are not necessarily incompatible.
Demokratisierung und politische Partizipation bei den Mbororo
in Westkamerun
Zusammenfassung: Während der letzten zwei Jahrzehnte profitierten die
Mbororo – eine “marginalisierte” ethnische Gruppe – ganz unerwartet von
einer neuen Politik in der Westregion Kameruns. Folgende politische
Veränderungen hatten positive Auswirkungen für die Mbororo: die neuen
gesetzlichen und institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen aufgrund der
Verfassungsänderung von 1996, die Folgen des politischen Wettbewerbs innerhalb
des Mehrparteiensystems seit 1990 und die Mobilisierung der Mbororo
durch eine nicht parteigebundene Vereinigung zur Förderung ihrer
Interessen als Ethnie, der 1992 gegründeten MBOSCUDA. Die Kombination
dieser Faktoren führte zu einem politischen Erwachen der Mbororo. Der
vorliegende Beitrag möchte zu einem besseren Verständnis der
Bestimmungsfaktoren und der wesentlichen Beteiligten an dieser Entwicklung beitragen.</p>
