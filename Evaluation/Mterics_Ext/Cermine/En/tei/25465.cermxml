        <p>OF THE REGION: Competitiveness is a popular term which is used by economists, officials, and policy-makers to justify actions that should be implemented in order to improve the status of an object relative to other objects having similar characteristics, in terms of its performance compared to other objects of the same class. In particular, industrial policy is seen as a set of activities aimed at improving competitiveness of certain categories of producers (e. g. national producers), or goods (services)1 manufactured in the country (region). However, despite the widespread use of the concept of competitiveness in general and that of competitiveness of the region in particular, there are often quite serious difficulties with offering an operational concept of competitiveness, especially when it concerns the content of the term. The phenomenon of regional competitiveness implies a complex of characteristics, each of which is essential for understanding this phenomenon as a whole. Indeed, the phenomenon of competitiveness in the socio-economic</p>

      <p>1 We will not consider the criteria of belonging to the category of domestic
producers. We will only note that it is not a trivial issue, because the mere fact that goods
and services are produced on a specific territory (in this case in Russia or the
territory of a region) is not a sufficient reason to qualify it as a domestic or regional
producer.
system can hardly be considered outside the relevant context of interaction
between the actors, without defining the characteristics of competitiveness,
or without identification of the necessary criteria to assess the level of
competitiveness or its modifications. These aspects are closely intertwined, that
is why an orderly presentation of their conjunction is essential for the
formation of a unified vision of competitiveness of any subject in general
(including companies, organizations, national economy, etc.), and the region in
particular.</p>
      <p>The main goal of this article is to formulate a framework of the concept
of regional competitiveness. The “framework” of the concept implies, first
and foremost, a number of general issues of regional competitiveness, which
should be specified in relation to a specific territory (a region or a group of
regions).</p>
      <p>Achieving the goal involves a set of tasks, including:
• identification and description of the key components of the theory of
competition by location;</p>
      <p>• elaboration of the content of regional competitiveness as an analytical
tool necessary to define a strategy for regional development;
• identification of the factors conditioning the competitiveness of a region;
• elaboration of regional competitiveness indicators;
• use of non-quantification characteristics of the region's competitiveness.</p>
      <p>We will assume that a region is a relatively separate area with a set of
characteristics significant in terms of economic exchanges in general, and
entrepreneurship, in particular, but at the same time not possessing such
attributes of national sovereignty as its own currency, armed forces, foreign
policy and, therefore, not providing services such as: national security and
macroeconomic stability. Isolation of the territory may be manifested in
different forms, ranging from the existence of customs borders, either de
facto or de jure, to simply registration of a company as a legal entity in a
given territory. It is necessary to emphasize that regions may differ in some
individual characteristics of their institutional environment, for instance the
capacity of regional authorities to establish formal rules and mechanisms and
to ensure compliance with all these rules, both formal and informal.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>1. Location-based competition</title>
      <p>The understanding of the competitiveness of the region, as one of its
important features, is largely dependent on the content of the notion of
competition because competitiveness virtually refers to the subject and/or the result
of a certain activity, while competition is a situation, or a process where
this competitiveness occurs (and/or is formed) irrespective of the category
of subjects, which participants of competition belong to (business entities,
national economies, regions, etc.)</p>
      <p>In other words, competitiveness occurs when a subject, whose
competitiveness is being characterized, is in a privileged position vis-à-vis other
actors/ subjects or at least does not worsen its position in relation to other
actors (competitors). That is why, it is important to understand that there is a
conjunction between the notion of competition and competitiveness, and
there is a separate issue of identification (including a quantitative one) of the
degree of preponderance through a set of indicators.</p>
      <p>That is why understanding the content and possible forms of competition
creates an essential condition for giving a systemic definition and study of
the problem of competitiveness. Before we touch upon various types of
competition, it should be noted that the understanding of competition is also
varied. However, our task does not include a detailed analysis of the content
of competition and major consequences that the chosen definition implies.
We will focus on two approaches to defining competition: the static and
dynamic ones.</p>
      <p>In accordance with the static approach, competition is a situation in
which achievement of the goal by one subject is at the same time
effectively limited by the competitor’s desire to achieve the same goal. To put
it otherwise, the key feature of static competition is inaccessibility of the
same “benefit” for several subjects simultaneously. Though availability of
the same benefit for different subjects is possible if the benefit is public (one
of the distinguishing features is absence of competition in consumption. For
example, the emergence of additional viewers of fireworks does not lead to
inaccessibility of the fireworks as a spectacle for others2).</p>
      <p>In accordance with the dynamic approach, competition is a process of
discovering new opportunities for the use of the already known
resources, as well as a process of using or creating new resources [4]. Since
the discovery of new opportunities is often associated with the use of
information and exchange of knowledge in society, competition can also be seen
as a process of identifying and sharing knowledge and information about
quality, and about alternatives to using various resources in various possible
variants of their use [1, p. 316].</p>
      <p>Unless it is specified otherwise, in future we will use the term
competition in its static understanding, when dealing with the problem of
competitiveness of the region without special emphasis on the composition and
change of structure of the political market at the regional level. We will only
note that the functioning of the political market may lead to both widening
and narrowing of opportunities for entrepreneurial activities which are
focused on creating value rather than its redistribution or destruction. It does
not follow from what has been said that the dynamic approach to the
definition of competition is inapplicable to the situation of interaction of economic
agents on the goods and service market while determining competitiveness
of the object under research.</p>
      <p>Forms of competition, in the static sense, are manifold. In particular, it is
well known that economic theory distinguishes between the following types
of competition: price and non-price competition, fair and unfair, current and
intertemporal, product and location, ex ante and ex post, for the market and
in the market, as well as actual and potential ones.
2 Strictly speaking, this benefit can be attributed to the «transferred» to public, when
after a certain point the marginal cost of providing this service begins growing.</p>
      <p>Both the content of competition and competitive characteristics largely
depend on the properties of the product, which is the result of performance
of a corresponding subject, a party of competition. For example, if a product
(for example, a new computer programme) can easily cross the border but
registering the very fact of its production in the country requires significant
costs, then other factors of regional competitiveness such as, for example,
quality of life of the product’s manufacturer will be of importance.</p>
      <p>If we regard competition between economic agents in the market as a
reference point and assume that the agents belong to the same market (in
terms of their product and geographic boundaries), which actually means
identical location, then this factor has no independent importance from the
point of view of competition. Weakening of this assumptions leads to the
following conclusions:</p>
      <p>(1) location may affect the conditions of actual competition (and,
consequently, the competitiveness of the producer);</p>
      <p>(2) location should be taken into account when assessing potential
competition and corresponding potential competitiveness.</p>
      <p>The second point is important in case the actors do not compete directly
as they work on different markets, but the parameters of their activities, as
well as the results, are comparable. This mechanism is known as yardstick
competition [5].</p>
      <p>Economic activity in general and entrepreneurship in particular, occur at
a certain time and in a certain place. Territorial identity, when the same
entity can not be located in different areas, or in other words, when the same
legal entity is registered in different regions and can not simultaneously
carry out the same activity in different regions, is very important because it
is a basis of location-based competition.</p>
      <p>In its pure form, location-based competition will operate as follows.
Let’s assume that there are some isolated areas among which there are some
randomly distributed economic unit creating a certain value. Each economic
unit is the centre of decision-making, and the decisions reflect the interests
of the entity controlling the unit.</p>
      <p>If the terms of interaction with other economic units and between this
unit and the entity in control of the territory are less favourable than
elsewhere, then for the decision maker in the given economic unit there emerge
incentives for the relocation of its economic activity to another territory. All
other things being equal, ceteris paribus, the more favourable the conditions
of entrepreneurial activity in the region, the more entrepreneurs would run
their business in the region. Moreover, it is important to note that this is not
necessarily true only speaking about the transfer of a business from one
region to another. Competition can also take place indirectly when business
develops as a result of decisions made by those who live in this or that
region and decide to set up their own business3. As a result, the number of
3 It is important to make one reservation: we do not consider specific issues of
specialization of a territory in production of a certain class of products; the default
assumption is that comparative advantages are important, but are not a sole
determinant of economic profile of the territory.
business registration and the number of businesses per a fixed number of
people (usually per 1000) grow.</p>
      <p>It is clear that for effective location-based competition, many conditions
must be fulfilled. But the most important one is that the expected net profit
from the transfer from one territory to another (taking into account the
discount) must not be less than the cost of business transfer, that is, the costs to
be paid by the specified entity to move the business from one territory to
another.</p>
      <p>The costs of business transfer are crucial to ensure the effectiveness of
competition ex post, i.e., for those businesses that are already operating in
the territory of one of the regions. The effectiveness of competition ex post
depends largely on the development level of the markets infrastructure,
including the markets for the buying/selling of businesses (especially when
this is a small and medium size business, which practically does not use
stock exchange mechanisms [3]), housing and other real estate, and labour.
The functioning of infrastructure markets involves a physical movement of
economic agents in territorial space (in economic theory, this kind of
movement, in the context of competition, is called “voting with one’s feet”).</p>
      <p>In addition, consideration should be given to two more options for a
business — switching to the shadow scheme or abandoning business all
together. In this case, the region's competitiveness as such should be separated
from the competitiveness of formal institutions, regulating the activities of
economic agents, and the competitiveness of similar institutions that regulate
the same activity but are outside the framework of government regulations
and security of property rights.</p>
      <p>We would also like to emphasize that at the categorial level, there should
be a distinction between attractiveness (competitiveness) of the region for
entrepreneurship and that for living (free time consumption). The better the
transportation infrastructure, the higher the differentiation of the
neighbouring regions in their living conditions (the cost and quality of housing,
environment, etc.), the more actual the distinction becomes.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>2. Competitiveness of the territory</title>
      <p>Understanding the notion of the competitiveness of the territory is
largely dependent on the context it is used in. Obviously, while studying
interregional links, first and foremost, there emerges a thesis of international,
interregional and, in general, inter-territorial trade. From this perspective, the
fundamental rationale behind the direction of the movement of goods and,
respectively, specialization is comparative advantages resulting from
different opportunities, alternative costs of goods production on these territories.</p>
      <p>For all the complexity of modern theory of international trade, the basic
idea is simple. Territories (countries, regions) can, technically speaking,
produce the same (or quite intersecting) set of goods. However, an increase
in the volume of production of the same product will be directly related to
different levels of reduction in the production of other goods for different
countries.</p>
      <p>However, one should take into account two important considerations
which are crucial for understanding the content of the region's
competitiveness and conditions for its raising.</p>
      <p>Firstly, in the theoretical models comparative advantages are initial
conditions for explaining the direction and scale of trade between territories.
However, in practice, identification of these comparative advantages in a
complex, diversified economy is a separate issue. Accordingly, the more
precise the mechanism with the help of which the comparative advantage is
revealed, the higher the competitiveness of the territory is. However, one
should admit that in bilateral trade, inadequacy in identifying the
comparative advantage may have a negative impact on trade partners.</p>
      <p>Secondly, one can imagine a fairly unique, but yet an important case
when two countries' alternative costs of production of a fixed set of goods
are the same. The differences are only in the direct costs associated with
productivity factors. Does this mean that the two countries (or two regions)
are equally competitive? It is clear that substantial differences in
productivity come from the characteristics of the regions, for example, from the
regulatory regime.</p>
      <p>Competitiveness is a relative (comparative) characteristic of the
subject of actual or potential competition, regardless of the characteristics of
competition. As can be seen from the previous statement, it is necessary to
distinguish between competitiveness of an individual business entity
(industry) and the region's competitiveness. In terms of the market functioning
scheme, competitiveness of the region derives from the competitiveness of
its enterprises. The higher (lower) the competitiveness of enterprises, other
things being equal, the higher (lower) the region's competitiveness is. In its
turn, in the first approximation, competitiveness of an enterprise is expressed
in terms of how efficiently the production factors are used and what the
prices of these factors are. However, it should be born in mind that
companies may belong to different sectors of economy; they may be different in
size, and in their organizational and legal forms. That is why, the specified
ratio is more complex in its character.</p>
      <p>In addition, there is no uniform understanding of the competitiveness of
a separate business, industry or national economy in economic literature. In
Yassin and Yakovleva’s [7, p. 8] works there is a working definition of the
competitiveness of goods and services, which is the “ability to sell them
[goods and services — A. Sh.] at market prices getting normal profit”. By
default, it is assumed that the long term survival of a business in the market
is possible only if its average total costs are not lower than the market price,
which corresponds to the conditions of equilibrium in a competitive market.</p>
      <p>However, as it was already indicated above, the static approach to the
definition of competition is not the only possible one. In principle, there are
five basic approaches to resolve the issue of operationalization of the
concept of competitiveness4:
4 These results were obtained based on a study carried out by the “Bureau of
Economic Analysis” Foundation in 2001.</p>
      <p>1. A simple approach based on a comparison of certain traditional
separate indirect indicators of productivity and competitiveness at the level of an
industry and national economies;</p>
      <p>2. An approach based on the M. Porter’s competitive forces model
identifying competitive advantages of national economies;</p>
      <p>3. An approach based on an assessment of inefficiency of the firm
(compared with best current practices) and a construction of a regression model
so as to explain the reasons for such inefficiency (the OCRA model);
4. Hypotheses about the directions of labour specialization as a factor in
improving the competitiveness of firms.</p>
      <p>5. An approach based on the calculation of competitiveness indicators
for the industry/company performance through the competitiveness of goods.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the names/terms used here, are not universally
accepted but reflect the essence, the main characteristics of the described
methodology.</p>
      <p>The task of elaborating the concept of the region’s competitiveness,
despite the relative simplicity of the general idea that can be laid at the
foundation of this concept, in fact may prove much more difficult than
competitiveness of a branch of industry or a business.</p>
      <p>Competitive location, in the first approximation, actually means that the
region is competitive; it can be viewed through the prism of contractual
relationship between an entrepreneur (investor) and regional authorities. This
does not mean that such a contract must exist explicitly. Typically, there is a
hidden, implicit contract, which, however, can be reconstructed with the help
of the tools of economic analysis.</p>
      <p>Since direct investments, if we do not take into account bank loans, are
subject to greater or lesser territorial fixedness, especially when it comes to
the construction of buildings, as well as to installing equipment which is
difficult to transport distance-wise, the principal concern for the investor is
not only the proposed conditions, but also guarantees that (a) they will not
change and (b) that the alleged conditions are consistent with the actual
conditions (rules and mechanisms to ensure compliance with them will be
consistent with each other). In other words, the task of regional authorities is to
ensure credibility of their commitments. Moreover, de facto the right to
assess reliability of this kind of promises is granted to business community.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, this reliability consists of at least two parts. The first relates
to the reliability of the commitments of the regional authorities to create
such conditions, whereas the second is the reliability of commitments of the
authorities at a higher level, which, in terms of the classification factors of
competitiveness, can be attributed to exogenous ones.</p>
      <p>However, as in any contractual relationship, the problems arising from
the formulation of commitments and ensuring compliance with them are
reciprocal. That is why the fulfilment of any agreement implies that the
reliability of commitments concerning the proposed entrepreneurial activity is
complemented by measures of control and effective restrictions on
misconduct and violations of the rules likely to be committed by economic entities.</p>
      <p>Competitiveness of the region is closely intertwined with its economic
development, so the relation between the two phenomena requires special
attention.</p>
      <p>If competition between regions for attracting business is aimed at
creating value, then economic development can be regarded as a consequence of
this kind of competition. Consequently, competitiveness and economic
development of the region are positively linked.</p>
      <p>A distinction should be drawn between economic development and
economic growth, due to possible changes in the resulting macro-economic
indicators in the first place, and the gross regional product, without innovation as a key
feature of economic development. In other words, economic growth is only
possible if there is an increasing the amount of resources and they are efficiently
used, while technology may remain unchanged, so may the assortment range of
products, acting organizational forms, a set of resources, as well as the market
composition of goods and services that the regions use.</p>
      <p>Competitiveness, defined as survival of a business entity on the market,
is not linked explicitly to efficiency (at least in the short term perspective).
This may be due to the fact that business actors, competing with each other,
may have fundamentally different stocks of resources.</p>
      <p>Let us consider in more detail the relationship between competitiveness
and economic development. At first glance, the relationship between
competitiveness and economic development is simple and unambiguous: the
more competitive the region is, the faster its economic development and vice
versa — the faster the economic development, the higher the
competitiveness. However, when analyzing the relationship between the two
phenomena, a number of circumstances should be taken into account.</p>
      <p>1. The definition of competitiveness, as a rule, implies a correlation of
one entity and the other at the same point of time because competition takes
place in real time. In its turn, economic development is determined by a
correlation of successive emerging states of the same object. One exception is
intertemporal competition, when a business entity actually competes with
itself by supplying the market with durable goods.</p>
      <p>2. It is also possible to define competitiveness of producers outside the
context of economic development as situations in which, according to J.
Schumpeter, there are no new combinations which are being important signs
of economic development. It is clear that this is only a theoretical abstraction
which shows that one phenomenon (competitiveness) is not identical to the
other (economic development).</p>
      <p>3. However, an increase of competitiveness is related in an even more
complex way with economic development, because the way how to raise
competitiveness is of great significance. If it involves the creation of
incentives for economic agents to seek new ways of productive and efficient use
of the existing limited resources, and/or discover new resources, in this case
the factors enhancing competitiveness also act as economic development
factors. But if an increase of competitiveness of business entities, as well as
territories, is due to the industrial policy, resulting in a meaningful
redistribution of scarce resources in favour of certain categories of industries or
producers, then as a consequence of distortion of incentives, these factors,
which are seemingly increasing the competitiveness of goods, do not create
sufficient incentives for economic development.</p>
      <p>The main conclusion is that the content of economic development of the
region, considered in the context of competition between regions in the field
of business development and focused on creating value, and the content of
competitiveness of the region largely overlap.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>3. Factors of regional competitiveness</title>
      <p>If competitiveness of the region is a relative characteristic of a territory,
defined in the context of competition as a certain process, then
circumstances, actions of people, or groups of people, who have an impact on the
specified characteristics of the region will be defined as factors of
competitiveness.</p>
      <p>Taking into account a close interconnection and, at the same time, some
ambiguity in the correlation between economic development and the
competitiveness of the region, it should be noted that the relation between them,
described in the previous section, is reflected in the factors of economic
development and competitiveness, respectively.</p>
      <p>The classification of economic development factors of the region was
carried out by L. A. Grigoriev and Y. Urozhaeva [2]. In accordance with
their classification, three groups of factors are identified: “natural”
(objective), factors external to the region and institutional ones. Accepting the
basis of the proposed classification, we would like to point out, however, that
the above mentioned classification does not meet the requirements of the
theoretical classification, since the classification grounds are not clearly
defined and many factors within the groups may partly overlap. This fact will
be taken into account in the further discussion of the issue of the factors of
the competitiveness of the region. Since the region’s competitiveness (its
increase or sustaining its high level) is the goal of socio-economic policies,
there is also a practical question of how this goal can be achieved.</p>
      <p>We can formulate several working criteria for a classification of the
factors of the region’s competitiveness:
(1) the significance of the factor;
(2) the dependence of the factor on decisions taken by actors in the
socio-economic policies in the region;
(3) duration of the factor (short, medium and long term ones).</p>
      <p>
        The following sections focus on the exogenous and endogenous factors
of competitiveness, i. e. factors of the second group. That is why, in this
section we will briefly comment on two other groups as well. In terms of
their impact on the level of competitiveness, the factors are not equal. For
example, if one considers the change in GDP as a reflection of
entrepreneurial activity, then among such factors as human capital, macroeconomic
policy, and the quality of institutions the latter is most significant5 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">9</xref>
        ]. By
insti5 Note that some researchers point to interdependence of macroeconomic policy and
quality of institutions.
tutions we mean rules (formal and informal), as well as mechanisms to
ensure compliance with them, including arrangements relating to the
application of sanctions to violators. Accordingly, if one compares the relative
dynamics of the GDP during a reasonably long period of time, it will broadly
reflect the quality of institutions.
      </p>
      <p>Exogenous factors are such factors of regional competitiveness, any
change in which is not a direct consequence of economic decisions and
actions, taken at the level of the region.</p>
      <p>Exogenous factors include, first of all, institutional conditions of
economic activity reflected in the federal laws; they are connected to
mechanisms ensuring compliance with these laws through federal institutions and
their territorial branches. There is only one limitation: if this region is not
dominant in terms of creating system rules.</p>
      <p>In this context decentralization and deregulation of economy can be
important factors of enhancing competitiveness of peripheral regions, when the
right to make meaningful decisions and the corresponding tax sources are
delegated to the level of the region.</p>
      <p>Integration processes in economies, that create a need for decisions
related to business development at a larger scope than that of one particular
region, are of great importance too. First of all, it refers to large integrated
business groups (IBG). On the one hand, decisions concerning IBGs affect
many regions at once, so the influence on the behaviour of any IBG, which
presupposes reaching a certain “critical mass”, involves problems of a
collective action of the regions concerned. However, as a rule, IBGs make
strategic decisions without any interaction with a group of interested regions.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the number of IBGs whose interests are represented in
the region can be an important factor, just as important as the location of the
headquarters. As it was already mentioned, the presence of a large number of
IBGs in the region greatly diminishes the problem of dependence of regional
decisions on the interests of one separate IBG, particularly if IBGs are
heterogeneous.</p>
      <p>Another group of exogenous factors is associated with the state of key
resources before business entities, operating in the region and affecting its
competitiveness, make a decision. This is due to the fact that the history of
the region is important; it makes an impact on the competitiveness of
different forms of accumulated capital — human, physical and social, if the latter
implies a set of institutions.</p>
      <p>Finally, another group of factors involves changes which are exogenous
both, in relation to the actions of the federal government and in relation to
the business behaviour of a vast majority of IBGs.</p>
      <p>In particular, we are speaking about changes in the world commodity
markets, as they are an important component of production in a corresponding
region and export from the country in general. For Russia, this is, above all,
energy (oil and gas), as well as products of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy.</p>
      <p>However, it should be understood that within a fairly narrow food segment
there is a possibility of influence of the players’ decisions in the national
economy, in terms of economic exchanges across the world market, which in its turn
could have the opposite effect on the competitiveness of a region.</p>
      <p>Thus, exogenous factors include:
(1) decisions of the federal government (including decision to devalue
the national currency, decision about privatization or nationalization of
certain objects);</p>
      <p>(2) decisions made in integrated business groups, whose activities are
carried out simultaneously in many regions;</p>
      <p>(3) accumulated characteristics of production factors (fixed capital stock,
human capital, natural resources, organizational capital);
(4) fluctuations in world commodity markets.</p>
      <p>All the factors listed above are not exogenous by definition if, for example, a
region itself or together with other regions can influence the decision of
important issues for the region (e.g., elaboration of the regional industrial policy).</p>
      <p>Endogenous factors are such factors of regional competitiveness, the
change of value of which is a direct consequence of decisions and actions
of the economic policy at the level of the region.</p>
      <p>One of the most important endogenous factors of the competitiveness of
the region is socio-economic policy of the authorities that affects the price,
which economic agents have to pay for services provided by the regional
authorities (institutional infrastructure, real infrastructure) and the quality of
these services. It has to be noted that a reduction in prices in the form of
easing the tax burden can be considered as a factor enhancing
competitiveness of the region, which, nevertheless, can be outweighed by other factors;
firstly, due to poor quality of services, especially public benefits, and
secondly, due to diminishing competitiveness in the future (a decrease in
regional public finance).</p>
      <p>There is another aspect of the influence of socio-economic policies on the
region's competitiveness. Most clearly it can be seen in the ratio of industrial and
competition policies. Industrial policy is a redistribution of resources
targeted at specific industries or groups of companies. Competition policy
aims at creating incentives for economic agents in terms of generating
innovation (technological, product, and organizational) by means of creation
and maintenance of competitive conditions in the target markets.</p>
      <p>Strictly speaking, the establishment of formal institutions is the only
factor which the authorities can control. This factor affects the
competitiveness of the region through incentives for those economic agents who make
decisions related to the creation of value, and also (if it would be preferable),
redistribution of value or even its destruction. From this perspective,
location competitiveness is, above all, competitiveness of institutions
(national and regional).</p>
      <p>In accordance with the approach proposed by Yassin and Yakovleva [7,
p. 8], the competitiveness of institutions is the compliance of formal and
non-formal institutions in the country (laws, norms and traditions of
behaviour of the authorities, use of power, degree of freedom, the radius of trust)
with the requirements of production of competitive goods and services. In
connection with the given definition it is important to say the following:
1. One can speak about not only the competitiveness of national
institutions, but also regional institutions competitiveness;
2. It is necessary to confine to formal and informal rules governing the
interaction between economic agents, as well as the interaction of economic
agents with state authorities;</p>
      <p>3. Mechanisms ensuring compliance with the established rules should be
regarded as a special component of institutions. Rules for permitted (or
prohibited) actions should be consistent with best practices. But this is not
enough for the elaboration of adequate incentives.</p>

      <title>4. Indicators of regional competitiveness</title>
      <p>The effect of the factors of regional competitiveness determine the
characteristics of the region, which were described in the second section in the
context of determining the quality characteristics that affect the incentives of
individuals taking economic decisions.</p>
      <p>However, in order to operationalize this conception, it is important to
identify indicators of competitiveness.</p>
      <p>As there are many factors as well indicators of competitiveness, it is
necessary to streamline them and analyze their relation to one another. The first
subsection deals with specific indicators of competitiveness which reflect
some aspects of the business agent’s performance. The second subsection
deals with the problem of formulating a generalized indicator of
competitiveness. The third subsection identifies indicators associated with
competitiveness.</p>
      <p>Specific indicator is an indicator of the region's competitiveness,
which reflects a subset of location competition aspects.</p>
      <p>In accordance with the existing standard approaches used to quantify
competitiveness, one can single out the following indicators: (1) productivity
level (2) labour cost per production unit, (3) the coefficient of identified
comparative advantages.</p>
      <p>If the theory of international trade is taken as a starting point, then the
key indicator is associated with the comparative advantages of the country
(region). In research, the coefficient of identified comparative advantages is
used; it is calculated as the ratio of the share of the country (region) in the
world (national) market of the product (export) to the share of the country's
imports of this product (import from other regions6 [7, p. 16]).</p>
      <p>
        Mathematically, this coefficient can be represented as follows [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">8</xref>
        ]:
      </p>
      <p>RCAi = (Xi /Σ Xi — Mi/Σ Mi) · 100,
where RCAi is the coefficient of the identified comparative advantages
which, theoretically, can change from -100 to 100, Xi/ΣXi is the country’s
share of world export, Mi / ΣMi is the country’s share of world import.</p>
      <p>It should be noted at once that this indicator is not practicable for regions
for lack of adequate statistics on the movement of goods between regions
(without crossing national borders).
6 Adjustment to the definition of the regional component is presented by the author
of the article.</p>
      <p>Among the indicators that reflect individual aspects of the region's
competitiveness one can also take into account direct investments, changing
numbers of small enterprises per 1000 inhabitants (adjusted for the
proportion of non-operating SMEs), actually reflecting the intensity of the business
registration process.</p>
      <p>The greater the number of SMEs per capita, given all other conditions
being equal, the more competitive the region is. In this thesis, the principle
of “other conditions being equal” is essential. It is clear that “traces” of
regional competitiveness can also be found in retrospect if we assume that the
dynamics of key indicators is the result of location-based competition. This
applies, above all, to such indicators as GRP, including GDP per capita,
current investments and others.</p>
      <p>Among the most obvious indicators of competitiveness to be applied is
the amount of added value per worker. As the impact of economic activity is
estimated through added value, thus the more value is added in the region,
ceteris paribus, the more competitive the business operating in the region is,
and, consequently, the more competitive the region is (if one uses the logic
of competition by location in association with the region's competitiveness
on the one hand, and the correlation between the region's competitiveness
and competitiveness of the region's products, manufactured in the territory,
on the other). However, in most cases data on added value is not available.</p>
      <p>Generalized indicator of competitiveness is the one that takes into
account all major aspects of competitiveness. The generalized indicator of
competitiveness is unlikely to have any dimension: it is, probably, a numeral
as is, for example, the indicator of elasticity. Approaches to the calculation
mechanism of this numeral may be different.</p>
      <p>1. One option: one can calculate the average fraction for the entire set of
major factors affecting competitiveness, assessing the significance and role
of each factor. If the value of this indicator for a particular region is above
average, then the region is competitive.</p>
      <p>2. Another option: choosing, as a starting point, the best value for the
entire set and comparing it with specific values obtained for the region. In this
case the value can not be greater than one (1), although it is possible that this
value will be equal to 1 (for the leader region).</p>
      <p>3. The third option: the reference point is maximum possible values of
the indicators, whereas the actual values for each region indicate deviations
due to the untapped reserves. In this case, the standard value would be less
than one (1) for all regions (including the leader region).</p>
      <p>Among important indicators and characteristics of the region (which are
related to its competitiveness, but do not exhaust its full content, though they
are used as stand-alone characteristics of this region), one can point out
investment attractiveness of the region and the regional budgets reflected in
the ratings of paying capacity.</p>
      <p>In the comparative assessment of any region, various kinds of ratings are often
used as they can help sort out the regions according to the established criteria.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that investment attractiveness ratings may indicate the
specialization of the region, if we assume that in the world markets there are
relatively stable favourable conditions for goods that are consistent with the
specialization of the region. That is why, there can be a positive correlation
between the level of investment attractiveness and competitiveness of the
region but it is not as strong as it may seem at first glance.</p>
      <p>As the region is the subject of location-based competition, the state of
the regional budget is very important, because it reflects not only the current
but also future regime of entrepreneurial activity in the region. Indeed, if the
budget of the region is made with a significant deficit, and is financed
through borrowings in the financial market and financing of medium-and
long-term programmes is implemented through the “short” money, then in
terms of attractiveness, ceteris paribus, the region will lose.</p>

      <title>5. Enhancing competitiveness of the region with the help of measures of socioeconomic policies at the regional level</title>
      <p>Understanding the content of competitiveness in positive terms is of
great importance for the development of socio-economic policies, both at the
level of economy as a whole and at the level of the region, given a set of
exogenous and endogenous factors (variables). Interdependence of various
aspects of competitiveness with social and economic policy has many
important aspects, two of which we will pay special attention to.</p>
      <p>There are three groups of tools, which can affect competitiveness of the
region. They are applicable to both national governments as well as regional ones.</p>
      <p>1. General measures to strengthen the regional economy and its position
in national and world economy, leading eventually to an increase of
competitiveness of firms and their products. Such measures shall provide the
basis for competitiveness for national economy and that of the region. These
general measures include, first and foremost, institutional framework for
economic activities, related to the formation of business environment,
regardless of the expected gains of specific groups of businesses.</p>
      <p>2. State aid in the form of direct support to companies in their export
activities (grants, tax incentives, exemption from import duties on raw
materials, information support of export activities). For the regional government
this direction is less accessible than for the federal government (there is no
way to exempt from import duties on raw materials), as well as it involves
the risk of applying to them the norms of the federal law “On protection of
competition” in the event their activity restricts competition.</p>
      <p>3. Measures aimed at creating demand for regional producers in other
regions, as well as foreign markets (exhibitions, establishment abroad or in
other regions trade and information centres, etc.)</p>
      <p>These measures are not completely equivalent in terms of setting
appropriate incentives. However, they form a space for choice both in normal
conditions and in the conditions of a crisis. In this regard it should be noted
that the region's competitiveness will largely depend on the balance of
measures aimed at improving its competitiveness.</p>
      <p>Given the fact that the competitiveness of the region derives from the
competitiveness of products manufactured in its territory, identification of
strategies for improving the region's competitiveness in the context of
improving the competitiveness of the industries is of vital importance. It is
clear that the impact of efforts aimed at improving competitiveness of
industries will be different. Moreover, it is understandable that it is rational to
resolve issues related to enhancement of competitiveness of the region,
focusing on enhancement of competitiveness of the industry with a bigger
competitiveness potential.</p>
      <p>In this perspective there emerges a separate issue of a group of
industries, both in terms of potential impact of improving competitiveness and in
terms of tools that can be used to enhance this competitiveness.</p>
      <p>Problems with the use of indicators of competitiveness in quality control
actually minimize the risk of manipulating them. Let's try to explain the
essence of the problem. Let’s assume that all players use the assumption that
the proposed indicators are adequate, in terms of comparative assessment of
the region (its competitiveness).</p>
      <p>If the welfare of a player depends on the level or the dynamics of this
indicator, there is a stimulus for a corresponding change of the indicator. Moreover,
the actors will look for ways to achieve this goal with minimum expenditures.
For example, if the dynamics of labour productivity is taken as a control
indicator, it might, other things being equal, encourage the use of labour-saving,
capital-intensive technologies. However, in the circumstances where a relatively
cheap labour is a competitive advantage, in terms of resources, the choice of this
indicator may lead to reduced competitiveness (at least in some areas).</p>
      <p>The assessment of competitiveness of the region involves a necessity to
take into account factors which are impossible or rather difficult to quantify.</p>
      <p>This is especially true for factors that are actually very complicated, in
terms of structure. Among them is the quality of the institutional
environment at the regional level, including not only the content of laws, but also
mechanisms ensuring compliance with them.</p>
      <p>In this respect, so as to solve this issue, it is necessary to pay more
attention to the characteristics of the institutional framework concerning the use
of limited resources, paying special attention to the significance of each of
the identified characteristics.</p>
      <p>Understanding the above-mentioned issue will ensure more caution
when applying all quantitative estimates of all changes in competitiveness
and, on the one hand, will encouraged seeking methods of quantification for
“non-quantifiable”, for the time being, factors, on the other hand.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The presented material on regional competitiveness provides the
following conclusions:</p>
      <p>1. Competitiveness of the region is an important component in
explaining both the level of economic development and the living standards in the
region. That is why improving competitiveness of the region is an important
task of economic policy at both the federal and regional levels;
2. Currently there is no generally accepted, rigorous and operational
definition of the term “competitiveness”, applicable to all cases of empirical
research in this area. This concerns the definition of the term in relation to
specific products or manufacturers, as well as to individual regions.</p>
      <p>3. However, competitiveness in the long run should be considered
through the prism of setting incentives for decision makers to seek new
areas, to use the already known resources, as well as to identify unknown ex
ante resources of creating added value. This applies to business entities and
to those decision makers who determine the quality of the institutional
environment in the territory. This approach is based on interdependence of the
notions “competition” and “competitiveness”.</p>
      <p>4. Competitiveness of the region depends on many factors which can be
classified. In terms of decision-making process the most important groups
are endogenous and exogenous factors of competitiveness.</p>
      <p>5. In applied research a variety of techniques are used to assess
competitiveness on the basis of designing a set of indicators, each of which has
comparative advantages and shortcomings. Among the most common are such
indicators as a comparative advantage, productivity and cost of labour per
unit of output. The choice of methods for assessing competitiveness depends
on the objective and accessible information. It should be born in mind that
available information is not always significant, and important information is
not always available. The ideal method applicable to all cases of assessment
of competitiveness has not been identified yet.</p>
      <p>6. It is necessary to distinguish between competitiveness of
manufacturers in the industry and market. If competitiveness of manufacturers in the
market is directly linked to the level of unit costs, competitiveness within the
industry (manufacturing heterogeneous and not always easily
interchangeable commodities) is linked to an additional factor — the choice of
specialization which adequately reflects the manufacturer’s comparative advantage.
In its turn competitiveness of the region implies not only the cost factor but
also specific institutional conditions of production, which should lead to
differentiation of the producer’s costs not only because of natural
comparative advantages or benefits in the organization, but because of differences in
costs associated with compliance with the mandatory requirements
established by the State (at the federal and regional levels).</p>
