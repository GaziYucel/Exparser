        <p>Aims To ascertain physicians' and parents' attitudes towards varicella vaccination acceptance and to compare them between Germany (G), where routine varicella vaccination is recommended in children, and France (F), where it is not. Methods Study design: cross-sectional pharmacoepidemiological study conducted in pediatric practice. Data included descriptions of the vaccinated children by pediatricians and descriptions of the parents' attitudes using a self-administered questionnaire. The next five successive children, under 15 years old, vaccinated against varicella were included in the study. Results Six hundred ninety-five pediatricians (F: 186; G: 509) and 2,593 parents (F: 664; G: 1,929) were included in the study. Initially, 7.1% of the German parents and 15.3% of the French parents were reluctant to have their children inoculated with the varicella vaccine (p &lt; 0.0001). The main reason for their reluctance was the 'fear of complications due to the vaccination' in both countries (G: 60.0% vs 55.5%; p: ns). Fewer German parents thought that the varicella vaccine was too recent (5.9%</p>

due to the cost of the vaccination (G: 11.9% vs F:22.8%;

for parents who were initially reluctant were ‘information on

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Many studies have shown that vaccines can protect children
and adults from bacterial and viral infections. Vaccination
has led to important reductions in the incidences of several
diseases and even eradication in same instances, for
example, small pox. Despite their proven effectiveness,
many children do not receive vaccines because of their
parents’ philosophy or religious beliefs, their concerns
about costs, or doubts about the usefulness, safety, or
efficacy of vaccines
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref15 ref2 ref4 ref6 ref8">(Poland and Jacobson 2001; Taylor et
al. 2002; Alfredsson et al. 2004; Fredrickson et al. 2004;
Freed et al. 2004)</xref>
        . Reluctance to use vaccines has been
fueled by reports of alleged adverse events from vaccines
spread by anti-vaccination web sites, as well as by recent
vaccine recalls and modifications
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref3 ref5">(Freed et al. 1996; Wolfe
et al. 2002; Flanagan-Klygis et al. 2005)</xref>
        . The situation is
worse when the vaccine is not universally recommended,
and even when a vaccine is recommended, not all
physicians immediately adopt it in routine use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Varicella vaccine is one example for which these issues
have slowed uptake. In the US, varicella vaccination has
been recommended since 1996, but it took nearly 5 years to
reach satisfactory coverage of more than 80% of children
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Sengupta et al. 2007)</xref>
        . This vaccination has led to a
reduction in the incidence of varicella of about 75%
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(CDC
2003)</xref>
        . Doctors must be ready to answer parents’ questions
and address misconceptions since parental beliefs may be a
major factor influencing whether a child receives the
varicella vaccine
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Taylor and Newman 2000)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The varicella vaccine is being increasingly used
throughout Europe, although with different administrative and
regulatory modalities. For example, in France, the varicella
vaccine has been registered since December 2003, but there
are no national recommendations for its routine use in
children. Recommendations exist for health-care and
childcare workers, those who have close contacts with
immunocompromised people, and children requiring a solid
organ transplant, and for people, at least 18 years old,
within 3 days of contact with an infected person. In
addition, this vaccine is not reimbursed by the health-care
insurance system. In contrast, in Germany, routine
administration to healthy children has been officially
recommended since July 2004, and it is reimbursed in most
administrative areas
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Rasch and Hellenbrand 2004)</xref>
        . Thus,
Germany and France provide an interesting comparison for
studying the effect of recommendations and funding on the
attitudes of parents concerning varicella vaccination. For
this we surveyed parents of children that were vaccinated
against varicella by private pediatricians or general
practitioners in Germany and France between March 2005 and
March 2006.
      </p>

      <title>Materials and methods</title>
      <p>The purpose of this cross-sectional study conducted
between March 2005 and March 2006 was to ascertain
physicians’ and parents’ attitudes towards varicella
vaccination acceptance and to compare them between Germany
(G), where routine varicella vaccination is recommended in
children, and France (F), where it is not. Two samples of
600 pediatricians (or GPs with essentially child-oriented
practices) selected at random in France and Germany were
involved. They were asked to include the next five
successive children they vaccinated against varicella during
the next month. These recruitment conditions led in each
country to a sample of 3,000 cases providing a confidence
interval of under 2% in case of an observed percentage
under 5%. This choice was made due to the fact that we
expected a low value for some questions, in particular for
the spontaneous request for varicella vaccination, especially
in France, where it is not reimbursed. These children had to
be under 15 years of age and had to have no
contraindications to the vaccine. Information on the main
demographic and clinical characteristics of the vaccinated
children as well as why the parents accepted the vaccination
was recorded by the physician on the physician’s
questionnaire. Information on the parents’ attitudes concerning the
varicella vaccination was recorded on a self-administered
questionnaire that the pediatrician gave them after having
explained how to fill it in. This questionnaire was returned
directly to the data analysis center in a prepaid envelope to
protect anonymity. A common number included in the two
documents allowed matching the pediatrician form with the
self-administered questionnaire for the purposes of the
statistical analysis.</p>
      <p>Results are expressed as means with their standard
deviations for quantitative variables and by numbers and
frequency distributions for qualitative variables. Chi-square
analysis and analysis of variance were respectively
performed to compare qualitative and quantitative values
between France and Germany. A P-value of less than 0.05
was considered to indicate statistical significance.</p>

        <title>Population and context of the vaccination</title>
        <p>Between March 2005 and March 2006, 509 German
pediatricians participated in the study and only 186 French
pediatricians because of some recruitment difficulties in
relation to the absence of varicella vaccination
recommendations in France. This point will be discussed. The
questionnaire was given to the parents of 3,033 vaccinated
children. A total of 2,593 questionnaires was returned
(85.6% response rate; 1,929 from Germany and 664 from
France). The mean age, percentage of girls, family size, and
rank of the vaccinated children were similar for the two
countries (Table 1). The only variable that was significantly
different was the parent’s education level: 36.1% of parents
in Germany vs. 55.3% of parents in France were university
or advanced technical college graduates (P&lt; 0.0001).</p>
        <p>The rate of spontaneously requested varicella
vaccination was significantly higher for German parents than for
French parents (20.9% vs 12.6%; P&lt; 0.0001). As shown in
Fig. 1, except for ‘avoid illness’ and ‘child living in close
contact with other children,’ which are the two main
reasons for spontaneous requests for vaccination, nearly
all the other reasons given by parents were significantly
different between the two countries: ‘Prevent
complications’ was mentioned more often in Germany than in

media’ (42.3% vs 19.2%; P &lt; 0.0001). The reasons for a
spontaneous request for varicella vaccination were less
often in Germany than in France ‘avoid social and
professional impact of child’s illness’ (29.1% vs 47.7%;
P &lt; 0.0001), ‘child’s relative currently has varicella’ (5.6%

        <title>Parents’ opinions concerning varicella vaccination</title>
        <p>The analysis of the parents’ questionnaire (Fig. 2) reveals
that 7.1% of the German and 15.3% of the French parents
were initially reluctant to allow their children to receive the
varicella vaccine (P &lt; 0.0001). The two main reasons for
their reluctance were similar in the two countries, and both
concerned the vaccination itself: ‘Complications following
vaccination’ (G: 60.0% vs F: 55.5%; p: ns) and ‘too many
vaccinations’ (G: 43.0% vs F: 40.6%; p: ns). The varicella

vaccine was considered as being too recent by more French
than German parents (G: 5.9% vs F: 45.5%; p &lt; 0.0001).
Also, more French parents were reluctant due to the cost of
the vaccination (G: 11.9% vs F: 22.8%; p &lt; 0.02) or because
they considered their child too young (G: 5.9% vs F:
13.9%; p &lt; 0.05).</p>
        <p>In both countries, the most convincing arguments for
parents who were initially reluctant or who did not know
that a varicella vaccine existed were ‘information on the
potential seriousness of the disease,’ which was reported by
three-quarters of the parents, and ‘availability of an
effective, well-tolerated vaccine,’ which was mentioned
by 59.4% and 64.0% of the parents in Germany and France,
respectively (p: ns) (Fig. 3). The other reasons, in
decreasing order of importance, were information that
‘varicella is frequent and contagious’ and ‘prevention of
varicella scars’ and ‘impact on the family of the disease.’
Finally, the fact that vaccination is free of charge in
Germany was indicated as an advantage by 23.4% of the
German parents.

    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the current study, we investigated parents’ attitudes to
accepting varicella vaccination between France and Germany
and the best way to convince them to have their children
vaccinated.</p>
      <p>
        The comparison with Germany was chosen because it
was the first country in Europe that added varicella
vaccination to the national routine vaccination schedule
for all children; it was the first country in the European
Union to do this. The Ständige Impfkommission (Standing
Committee on Vaccination, STIKO) at the Robert Koch
Institute in Germany announced the change in their
published update to the national vaccine schedule
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11">(Robert
Koch-Institut 2004a, b)</xref>
        . According to these official
recommendations, varicella vaccination is scheduled for
infants aged between 11 and 14 months (given preferably
at the same time as the MMR vaccine). Catch-up
vaccination for children and adults is recommended, in
particular for persons aged 9–17 years who have not had
varicella infection. In France, no such recommendation
exists, and the comparison with Germany was done in
order to evaluate the impact of this recommendation and,
moreover, to analyze if the existence a such
recommendations was a sine qua non condition to the spreading of
the varicella vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>Potential biases should be considered before generalizing
the results to all parents of young children.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3 Most convincing
arguments in favor of varicella
vaccination. Comparison
between Germany and France</p>
      <p>The most important possible bias is that the physicians
who agreed to participate in the study may be those who are
most in favor of varicella vaccination and therefore the
most inclined to convince the parents. This bias is
unavoidable, but its influence would be the same in both
countries. This potential bias may also have had some
impact on the parents’ opinion, but the effect would have
been minimal because the parents completed a strictly
anonymous self-administered questionnaire that they sent
directly to the data analysis center.</p>
      <p>One other bias could be linked to the fact that the rate of
pediatricians participating to the study in France was much
lower than in Germany. The lack of a recommendation in favor
of varicella vaccination in France (and consequently the
absence of reimbursement) explains why many practitioners
are still reluctant to propose it to parents and thus the difficulties
we met recruiting regular varicella vaccine prescribers. These
recruitment difficulties have an unavoidable effect on the
precision of the results, providing an average confidence
interval of 2% for the German data and of 4% for the French
data rather than the initially expected &lt;2%. However,
taking into account that the lowest percentage described for
the French sample is 12.6% of spontaneously requested
varicella vaccination, this precision of 4% still appears
satisfactory.</p>
      <p>Another limit of our study is also due to the fact that we
only considered vaccinated children, while it could have
been interesting to describe the attitude and intentions from
the parents who refused the vaccination of their child. This
choice to focus our study on vaccination acceptance and
eventual previous reluctance and not on refusal was
dictated by the lack of recommendation for varicella
vaccination in France. Also, a written inquiry about the
patient’s refusal could have been interpreted by the health
authority as an unacceptable attempt to strongly influence
them, and the rate of spontaneous answer would have been
very low.</p>
      <p>Despite potential biases and limits, our results revealed
that the presence of a recommendation for the vaccination
in Germany and its absence in France have a major impact
on the parents’ knowledge about the disease and its
complications as well as on health-care promotion of the
vaccine.</p>
      <p>A first remark concerns the educational level of the
parents of the vaccinated children, which was higher in
France than in Germany. This reflects that in France, due to
the lack of official recommendation and of reimbursement,
the educational level and the level of income of parents has
a strong influence on the acceptance of varicella.</p>
      <p>
        Due to the availability of an official recommendation,
more German parents were aware of the varicella vaccine
and spontaneously requested vaccination. In addition, their
reasons for requesting vaccination were different. German
parents identified the main purpose of the vaccine as
preventing complications and were convinced by information
from the media, whereas the French parents’ motivations were
linked to the social and professional consequences of the
disease, the prevention of infection of others, or the fear of
scars. These findings suggest that even the French parents who
spontaneously requested the vaccine were not aware of the
seriousness of the complications of varicella. In Germany, the
parents’ attitudes are similar to those described for parents in
the US
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Taylor and Newman 2000)</xref>
        . In particular, when a
recommendation exists, parents are more convinced about the
advantages of the vaccine to prevent serious complications
than its ability to reduce time lost from work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The percentage of parents reluctant to accept varicella
vaccination in the current study does not reflect the
percentage in the global population; it reflects the initial
rate of reluctance of parents who finally agreed to have
their children vaccinated. Thus, the percentages reported
here cannot be used as the basis for making conclusions
about the reluctance for vaccination in the overall
population. The parents’ reluctance is mostly due to the fact that
they consider varicella to be a harmless disease and, above
all, fear of complications from the vaccine. The percentages
of parents who were reluctant due to fear of complications
of the vaccine (55.5% in France and 60.0% in Germany)
are similar to that reported in the US (69%)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Salmon et al.
2005)</xref>
        . The high proportion of French parents who said they
were reluctant because the varicella vaccine is too recent
(45.5%) is surprising, but is probably due to the fact that
since varicella vaccine is not officially recommended in
France, little information on varicella vaccination is
targeted to the general population. This is illustrated by
the fact that nearly half the French parents in our study
were unaware that a varicella vaccine has been available for
more than 10 years in the US, compared with 5.9% in
Germany.
      </p>
      <p>Differences in reluctance to have children vaccinated due
to cost were not as big as expected. However, this finding
may be biased by the socioeconomic profile of the French
participants; on average, they have a higher educational
level and therefore a higher income than their German
counterparts. We cannot, therefore, conclude that French
parents are probably more willing to pay than German
parents. This finding could suggest that, in the absence of
reimbursement, the use of the vaccine will be dependent on
the parents’ incomes.</p>
      <p>
        Our results show that in both countries the most
convincing argument in favor of the varicella vaccine is
the information given by the practitioner regarding the
seriousness of the disease and the availability of a
welltolerated vaccine. The results from a study in the US, where
the varicella vaccine has been recommended for more than
10 years, were similar; the most frequent factor influencing
parents’ decision was their doctor’s advice
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Freeman and
Freed 1999)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>In summary, our results show that both German and
French parents readily accepted varicella vaccination when
the practitioner recommended it and/or when they were
appropriately informed about the potential severity of
varicella disease and the safety of the vaccine, irrespective
of an official recommendation and reimbursement for the
vaccine. However, the absence of reimbursement may
affect some parents’ decision, due to the cost, and therefore,
this may lead to social inequality.</p>
