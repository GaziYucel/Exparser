      <p>The EU “Northern Dimension” initiative was put forward by Finland in
1997 and was first adopted by the European Commission as a strategy of the
EU for 2000—2003 in 1999. The key element of the “Northern Dimension”
is the development of cross-border cooperation between separate
administrative units of member states. In accordance with the EU documents, it
includes the territories of Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Baltic States and
Poland, as well as Karelia, the Murmansk, Arkhangelsk, Leningrad, Pskov,
Novgorod, Vologda, Kaliningrad regions of the Russian Federation and
Saint-Petersburg.</p>
      <p>The unique character of the “Northern Dimension” programme (ND) lies
in cooperation between participants conducted both vertically and
horizontally at several levels: the state, regional and local ones. For Russia, the ND
means an additional possibility to attract the attention of partners to the use
of resources located in underdeveloped areas, as well as to find joint
solutions to the problems of the Russian North-West cross border areas [2,
p. 180]. For instance: environment protection, transport and border
infrastructure, unemployment and healthcare problems and other issues.</p>
      <p>The development of the ND is, to a great extent, an activity in the
framework of certain policies. But it has a distinct horizontal dimension,
where coordination plays a significant role. Interaction and coordination of
the EU instruments and international finance institutions can provide for
higher efficiency and lead to practical results, especially in funding</p>
      <p>In 2003, the European Commission adopted the Second Northern
Dimension Action Plan for 2004—2006. The second ND was aimed at
contributing to the implementation of the Neighbourhood policy. Now, two
partnerships are taking place in the ND framework: the Environmental Partnership
and Partnership in Public Health and Social Well-being (established in
accordance with the Declaration adopted at the Oslo International Conference
on October 27—28, 2003). In four years, the Environmental Partnership has
proved itself an efficient multilateral cooperation mechanism with an
adequate financial base and project manager — The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. The total amount of funding is 1.8 billion euros.
Fifteen projects are being implemented in the Partnership framework that are
mainly financed by international development banks on a repayable basis,
while a part of finance is provided by the Special Environmental Partnership
Foundation as grants.</p>
      <p>The first priority projects in the framework of the partnership are
SouthEastern sewage disposal plants in Saint Petersburg (completed in 2005), the
flood protection system in Saint Petersburg, the sludge combustion plant in
Saint Petersburg (completed in 2007), the environmental investment
programme for the Leningrad region; modernisation of housing and public
utilities in Arkhangelsk, Syktyvkar and Novgorod, the modernisation of central
heating systems in Kaliningrad and Murmansk, the organisation of waste
management in Kaliningrad, cessation of waste disposal into the Neva, the
Ladoga ecological programme, water supply in Kaliningrad and Vologda [3,
p. 31].</p>
      <p>
        Though the ND initiative was highly criticized from the beginning, it led
to certain tangible results. Perhaps, its main advantage is the contribution to
the efficient involvement of Russia into European structures beyond the
socalled “high politics”. The interest in the ND, its implementation and
theoretical experience are expanding beyond Northern Europe and immediate
participant states [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">6</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the ND initiative is not merely interesting in itself, but also in
the context of EU-Russia relations. From a theoretical perspective, the ND
can be considered an element of strategically connected multilevel
interactions between the EU member states and Russia. Researchers have
repeatedly emphasised the principal importance of the multilevel character of
relations between these actors. It concerns (1) relations between the EU and
Russian institutions; (2) bilateral Russia-the EU member states relations; (3)
cross-border relations and cooperation at regional (subnational) level [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">12</xref>
        ].
Proceeding from this, we can take the next step and try to analyse the
consequences and effects of strategic interdependence between all Russia-the EU
relation levels in more details.
      </p>
      <p>Our basic argument is that both actors interacting at numerous
institutional levels and balancing between them are trying to achieve different
goals at the same time. The key actors should take into account the
consequences of interaction at different levels, but at the same time they
differently estimate the results of these interactions. Thus the choice or rejection
of cooperation strategy (or tactics) at one level can explain the character of
decisions made at other levels.</p>

      <title>The EU-Russia Relations: General Context</title>
      <p>Recently, the EU-Russia relations have developed in a peculiar manner:
there is a growing discrepancy between the actively developing trade and
foreign policy relations, which are approaching the ‘freezing point’. In 2007,
this discrepancy formed a steady tendency, since trade was developing to the
benefit of both parties, while the sphere of external relations was
increasingly taking forms unfavourable for Russia, significantly weakening the
international position of Russia not only at the present moment, but also for
the future. The middle of 2007 conceivably saw the transition to a
principally new paradigm of the EU standpoints in its relation to Russia —
European leaders admitted the inadequacy of the attempts to influence the
reforms in Russia and started establishing mechanisms aimed at the
elaboration of joint solutions allowing neutralisation of possible negative actions of
Russia towards the EU.</p>
      <p>The favourable vector of international relations development reached its
maximum in 1997 when, finally, the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation
Agreement, signed in 1994, came into effect. At that moment, the Treaty of
Amsterdam defined the constitutional (contractual) principles of the EU
foreign policy.</p>
      <p>Relations with Russia were considered a general foreign policy project
that is characterised by the concordance of the member state objectives, At
the same time it would be a “pilot project” to test new mechanisms of the
interaction of the EU (as a body) with the outer world. It was crucial to find
such a project, because the difficulty of the EU common policy development
consists in contradictory foreign policy interests of different states, first of
all, Germany, France and the UK. But, since all the EU member states are
interested in the predictability of Russia, the provision of this predictability
is the most evident first priority project of the new common foreign policy
[1]. The Treaty of Amsterdam defined the EU “common strategies” in
foreign policy as one of the most important instruments of the EU foreign
policy. The first “common strategy” (adopted in June 1999) was the programme
aimed at the development of democracy and market competition in Russia.
In general, it was expected by means of joint efforts it would be possible to
influence Russia in the same way Western victorious powers influenced the
development of post-war Germany and Japan, aspiring to the establishment
of democracy and competitive market as basic tools of a predictable
goodneighbour policy. It is well-know that states with democratically elected
governments cannot allow themselves to be at enmity with each other.</p>
      <p>In summer 1999, it could seem that Russia got an opportunity to benefit
from the interest of the EU states in the success of their first foreign policy
project aimed at the transformation of Russia into a democratic European
power, consistent with the common European rules. But soon after Vladimir
Putin had come to power, Russia started resisting the EU attempts to conduct
common foreign policy towards Russia. First of all, Russia tried to take
advantage of the contradictions within the EU. But soon the attempts to take
advantage of the contradictions and, especially, to oppose ‘old’ Europe to the
new members of the EU proved to be counterproductive. It became evident
in 2007, when, unexpectedly for the Russian diplomacy, Poland blocked the
subscription of the new PCA planned at the EU-Russia summit in Samara,
which Russia had been aiming at for five years. The leaders of the Union did
not merely refrained from calling Poland to ‘order’, but at the summit itself
(which was not successful due to the Polish veto) Manuel Barroso, the
President of the European Commission, firmly declared his support to Poland.</p>
      <p>It is important to mention, that one of the peculiarities of the EU is the
fact that this intergovernmental structure is still undergoing the process of
formation. It defines, to a great extent, the foreign policy strategies of the
Union, which are motivated more by attempts to create conditions for the
further accretion of the power to make the EU a real actor of foreign policy
than by the EU foreign policy interests. Thus member states should reject the
most significant part of their sovereignty which needs serious stimuli. Now,
economic cooperation in the framework of the EU has almost reached the
level of a federative union; and the Union represents the interests of all the
member states. In other spheres, first of all, in foreign policy, solidarity is
limited: the principles of decision-making have an intergovernmental
character, i.e. a decision is made only if the member states reached an accord. It
means that the mechanism of formulating “common interests” in this sphere
has not been elaborated yet; there is only a “common denominator” of
different interests.</p>
      <p>The prerequisite — the EU has not formed a mechanism of formulating
common interests — sometimes brings Russian diplomats to the false
conclusion that it is possible (and one should try) to take advantage of the
contradictions between the EU member states. At the same time they do not take
into account that for many European politicians the basic interest consists in
establishing common institutes (rules) of the EU foreign policy. Despite
different positions on certain issues, there is a collective comprehension of
the necessity to elaborate rules defining the future development of the EU
foreign policy.</p>
      <p>However, the increasing political tension between the EU and Russia can
be ‘compensated’ by cooperation at other institutional levels. So, political
frictions at the highest level can stimulate the participation of the Russian
government in regional EU initiatives (such as the ND). At the same time, it
is crucial that, in order to succeed in this balancing between levels, the ND
context should be separated from the problem field of the ‘high politics’. In
this case, cross-border and interregional programme(s) will be more efficient
if they are concentrated around local and not political issues. One should
admit that such programmes are hardly applicable to such ‘highly’
politicised issues as the development of democracy in Russia, the freedom of
media, human rights, security and energy resource supply. In other words,
experts working at both practical and ideological levels of the ND should
consciously avoid being involved in certain (political) problems.</p>
      <p>It is possible to assume that if some actors choose the level of EU-Russia
relations in general as a priority; others will be interested in the development
of bilateral relations. So, the priorities of different actors will differ. In
general, it can be expected that the EU member states and subnational territories
(regions) will follow different and, maybe, contradictory strategies towards
Russia. Moreover, the same actor will conduct different strategies at
different institutional levels. For instance, Finland will act differently in the
European Council, in the ND, and in bilateral relations with Russia. This lack of
consistency in EU foreign policy is a natural consequence of its multilevel
governmental structure.</p>
      <p>The development of the ND is a good example of how the tension in the
‘high politics’ do not restrict cooperation at lower levels. Different forms of
interregional cooperation in the framework of the ND achieved more
significant progress that it was expected by the critics of the initiative. Despite
numerous difficulties, the initiative was not seriously affected and involved in
the deteriorating relations between Russia and the EU and, what is most
important, Russia did not withdraw from the initiative maintaining its liabilities.</p>

      <title>The Formula of Success: Small Steps of Small Powers</title>
      <p>
        As Aalto shows [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">4</xref>
        ], the ND was, first of all, an attempt to overcome the
increasing demarcation between the EU and Russia by means of finding joint
solutions to functional problems and not meeting at another ‘high politics’
battle field. Security and political issues were either excluded from the
agenda or discussed in brief. Maybe, the best decision was not to tackle the
issue of oil and gas supply in mass media. Only nuclear safety and energy
efficiency were included in the ND Environmental Partnership. The
importance of the North for the EU energy strategy is understood by ‘European
bureaucrats’ perfectly well: “The Northern Dimension represents one
essential frontier for security of supply due to the importance of Russian and
Norwegian energy supplies.” (The EU Commission 1999:11).
      </p>
      <p>
        From the very beginning, the ND was oriented towards partnership and
equality approach, was open to equal partnership of non-EU member states.
As Lannon and Elsuwege point out: “The fact that these partner countries
have become involved in the process from the very beginning and
participated in the Foreign Ministers’ conferences on the Northern Dimension is
rather unusual in the EU context. In other words, the partner countries were
expected to be not only policy-takers but also policy-makers” [9, p. 25].
Browning and Joenniemi [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">5</xref>
        ] agree that openness to external participants is
indeed a peculiar feature of the ND. For all member-states this involvement
into the initiative grants an opportunity and grounds for the discussion of
urgent problems on the basis of equality. The equality and partnership
approach almost guaranteed that the ND would deal with a certain number of
issues, ‘acceptable’ for all participants. And indeed, the ND, as a rule,
conducts functional cooperation in the field of ‘low’ politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, Finland started to make efforts to transform the image of the ND
— from a foreign policy to a cooperation project that equally belonged to the
participant states and the EU [14, p. 6]. From all the partner states only
Finland is a member of the EMU, but is still sceptical about a common
defence policy. For an outside observer, the ND may seem a project, in the
framework of which Northern European States try to separately build their
relations with the rest of the world and Russia in particular. The ND can be
also considered as a ‘Northern alternative’ to the eastern and southern
vectors of the EU development. As Trenin assumes [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">13</xref>
        ] there is a possibility of
forming a new common global identity — the ‘Northern’ one.
      </p>
      <p>It was repeatedly emphasized that the ND proves the ability of small EU
powers to achieve much conducting ‘smart small policies’. If in the case of
Russia, it concerns the regions that actively participated in the ND activity
and success depended to a great extend on the interest and involvement of
local and regional (subnational) actors.</p>
      <p>It is not a coincidence that such initiatives and projects are implemented
at subnational level — it demands, in addition, the technology of
practicallyoriented cooperation. The attempts to harmonise and realise such projects
among national governments inevitably lead to significant transaction costs.
On the contrary, interregional contacts allow keeping costs low; cooperation
is developing as a ‘general practice’ beyond the ‘high’ policy context.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>EU Foreign Policy Subsidiarity Principle and Northern Dimension</title>
      <p>
        The development of “dimensions” is a form of exclusion: partnership in
a certain dimension means that the state cannot count on full membership in
the Union [8, p. 7]. The ND has both northern and eastern elements. And
from the point of view of its eastern “geography” it is indeed a border
between Europe and non-Europe [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">11</xref>
        ]. If one understands the ND in this way,
then it is based in Brussels in the offices where the EU foreign policy is
being elaborated [11, p. 97]. In other words, if one conceptualises the ND as an
element of the EU foreign policy, then it becomes a restricted regional part
of the common EU strategy towards Russia.
      </p>
      <p>Alternative future for the ND could consist in maintaining a certain
degree of independence from the EU foreign policy; the ND already has
important innovations and is different from the traditional instruments of foreign
policy, which makes it easier to achieve autonomy. The ND is a combination
of the partnership, equality and multilevel approaches, and such a unique
combination creates a “special subsidiarity form” — the EU states formulate
and realise foreign policy in collaboration with external actors able to
generate necessary ‘power’ to solve certain problems [7, p. 390]. Such subsidiary
allows the EU to conduct its multilevel foreign policy. On the other hand, the
most concerned member states can avoid the contradictions of ‘high’ politics
focusing on those fields of cooperation where the participation of regional
and subregional actors will lead to the creation of additional value (the
Northern Dimension Policy Framework Document, 2006).</p>
      <p>
        The subsidiarity principle applied to the ND drastically differs from the
ideas of “two-speed Europe” and “Europe of regions”. Perhaps, it can be
easily explained by means of multilevel governance approach, which implies
that the actors can influence the decision-making process in the EU by
numerous means — from collaborating with European institutions to indirect
actions through regional, national and subnational bodies. The policy thus
formed is a result of overlapping jurisdictions, tensions and conflicts in the
multilevel governance system [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">10</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>Applying this subsidiarity logic to the ND one can expect the process of
‘localised’ decision making become decentralised, i. e. dispersed among
different institutional levels — regional, national, subnational; while
supranational institutions will maintain responsibility for formulating the common
policy towards Russia. Thus, different questions will be located in the
jurisdiction of different actor in dependence on their importance and presence of
common interest.</p>
      <p>Let us mention, that the ND subsidiarity logic does not contradict (but
supplements) our argument put forward in the beginning of the article: the
key actors will define their strategies in accordance with, firstly, the general
context of EU-Russia relations, and, secondly, prioritisation at different
levels and concerning different issues. European (supranational) actors are more
likely to benefit from the participation of the ND in ‘high’ politics then the
participant states, subnational units and the Region in general.</p>
