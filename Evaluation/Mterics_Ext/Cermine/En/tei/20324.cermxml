        <p>A common feature in the empirical literature of intra-industry trade is the analysis of trade between a given reference country and a set of partners. This article differs from previous studies by examining the bilateral trade among all trading partners within a set of partners. Using a panel data approach, we find that differences in factor endowments seem not to be important as a driving force behind vertical intra-industry trade for European countries over the chosen period. More important driving forces are production size, geographical proximity, average income per capita and income distribution overlap.</p>

      <title>1 Introduction</title>
      <p>Trade between two countries within a product category is characterized as
intraindustry trade (IIT) if both export and import exist, and IIT is characterized as
horizontal (HIIT) if trade consists of varieties of the same quality, and as vertical
(VIIT) if the varieties are of a different quality. Empirical research1 points out that
VIIT is the dominant type of total IIT.</p>
      <p>A common feature of the above mentioned investigations is the analysis of trade
between a given reference country and a set of partners. The empirical results are
not unambiguous with regard to the relationship between differences in factor
endowments between trade partners on the one side and the two types of IIT on the
other. It is possible that the estimated relationships depend on the reference country.
Therefore, it is relevant to examine the bilateral trade among all partners within a set
of partners. Such an analysis has not yet been conducted in the international
literature. We conduct an econometric analysis of European VIIT in manufactured
goods from 1996 to 2005. The countries are the EU-15 countries and four East
European countries: Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic. The choice
of countries is determined by two considerations: (1) the availability of data for both
trade flows and explanatory variables and (2) the countries should operate on a
common market so that problems of trade barriers etc. can be left out of
consideration. We also analyze the implications of geographical proximity. This
determinant captures such factors as similarities in language and culture and thereby
similarity of consumer patterns. Finally, we investigate the role of income
distribution overlap between countries and the effect of production size.</p>
      <p>In Sect. 2, theoretical foundations and empirical applications are discussed. The
measurement of IIT is worked through in Sect. 3, and after some preliminary
investigations in Sect. 4, explanatory variables and hypotheses are listed in Sect. 5.
The results of the econometric estimations are shown in Sects. 6, and 7 concludes
the article.</p>

      <title>2 Theoretical foundations</title>
      <p>In this section, we discuss theoretical foundations of determinants that may explain
VIIT. We discuss the effect of income distribution overlap, difference in factor
endowment, production size and geographical proximity. By capital endowment we
mean physical capital, technological capital as well as human capital. In the
analysis, we discuss both the demand side and the production side.</p>
      <p>
        The theoretical framework of VIIT is rooted in the work of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">Linder (1961)</xref>
        although he did not use the term VIIT explicitly. Linder assumes that the individual
demand for quality of a given variety is increasing with income. Considering two
countries, an overlap in income distribution determines whether the demand for a
given good will exist in both countries. Within this overlap, consumers with low
incomes demand low-quality varieties, whereas high-income consumers demand
high-quality varieties. However, the overlap in income distribution can be so small
that low quality goods demanded in the low-income country are not demanded in
the high-income country. The same applies to high-quality goods. Therefore, a
variety on a given quality level is not demanded in both countries, and then VIIT in
this good cannot exist2.

        and

        also assign a central role to income
distributions. Moreover, the level of income per capita is determined by the capital
intensity, thus the capital-abundant countries have a relatively high income per

Our first hypothesis is

      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>H1: We expect VIIT to be more prominent among countries with a high degree of income distribution overlap.</title>
        <p>
          Turning to the production side, the quality level of a product variety increases
with capital intensity. If a given good is produced in two countries, one of which is
capital-abundant and the other is labor-abundant (or less capital-abundant), we may
assume that the capital-abundant country produces high-quality varieties, whereas
the labor-abundant (or the less capital-abundant) country produces low-quality
varieties. Depending on the demand in the two countries, as discussed above, VIIT
will arise3. Many authors in empirical analysis expect a positive relationship
between VIIT and differences in factor endowments, see e.g.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Durkin and Krygier
(2000)</xref>
          ,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">Mart´ın-Montaner and R´ıos (2002)</xref>

          and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">Zhang et al. (2005)</xref>
          . However, it is not sufficient to look at the
production side; the demand side needs to be included too as discussed above. Since
a large difference in factor endowments between two countries also indicates a large
difference in income per capita, we may even expect VIIT to be small in case of a
too large difference in factor endowments.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we turn to the empirical evidence of the effect of differences in factor
endowments on VIIT,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">Mart´ın-Montaner and R´ıos (2002)</xref>
          and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Mora (2002)</xref>
          use the
three above mentioned variables as a proxy of capital: physical capital,
technological capital and human capital.4

          find a positive
relationship between VIIT and the three variables, whereas
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Mora (2002)</xref>
          finds a
negative relationship between VIIT and physical capital. The two other capital
variables show a positive relationship, although not significant, as regards human
capital.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Durkin and Krygier (2000)</xref>
          investigate HIIT and VIIT in relation to physical
capital and use as a proxy of the latter, GDP per capita. They find a positive
relationship with VIIT. One the one hand, some of the estimated relationships are
insignificant, depending on how IIT is separated into HIIT and VIIT.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Crespo and
Fontoura (2004)</xref>
          also use GDP per capita as a proxy of physical capital and find a
positive relationship with VIIT. On the other hand, Gullstrand (2002b), who also
uses GDP per capita as a proxy of physical capital, expects a negative relationship
with VIIT. However, his empirical results do not support any explanatory power of
differences in factor endowments. Finally, it cannot be ruled out that differences in
factor endowments at industry level have a different impact on VIIT. Mora (2002:
pp 308–310) finds that at industry level for some industries the relationship is
positive and for other industries negative with regard to differences in factor
endowments. Since we chose VIIT as an aggregated index over industries, the
heterogeneity of industries in relation to a trading partner country has implications
for the direction of the relationship between the absolute difference in factor
endowments and VIIT. In other words the effect of differences in factor

endowments is not equal for all countries. Therefore, country-specific effects of
differences in factor endowments have to be investigated too. It appears that the
empirical results are not unambiguous as regards the relationship between
differences in factor endowments and VIIT. This is also confirmed in an analysis
by

          . Hence we can introduce our second hypothesis

        <p>The size of an economy matters too. The greater the size of an economy is, the
more industries will exist due to economies of scale. In order for VIIT to exist in a

likely be produced in a large economy than in a small economy due to diversity of
industries. Our third hypothesis is</p>

        <p>
          A pair of countries with very different industry structures and/or demand patterns
will necessarily have a lower VIIT than a pair of countries with coincident industry
structures and/or demand patterns. Since countries that are close to each other
geographically will tend to have relatively similar industry structures and demand
patterns due to e.g. linguistic and cultural similarities, VIIT may be larger among
such pairs of countries
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(see also Linder 1961)</xref>
          . Furthermore, the information costs
increase with geographical distance thereby hampering VIIT. Finally, geographical
proximity also reflects transportation costs. The smaller the transportation costs are,
the larger is VIIT. In fact, a robust empirical finding is that IIT and accordingly
VIIT decline with distance between trading partners (for further detai

      <p>An IIT index measuring intra-industry trade between two countries should remain
invariant if it is calculated from trade data reported by a certain country or by data
reported from its trade partner due to the symmetry of the formulas. To see whether
this is the case, correlations between IIT indices based on trade data reported by a
country and data reported by its partner are shown in Table 1.

        <p>With respect to Ireland, Greece and Hungary, the reported trade data are not in
accordance with the figures reported by the partners as regards HIIT. The problem
may be caused by erroneously reported trade quantities. These are used to calculate
unit values that serve as a basis to separate horizontal trade from vertical. As regards
IIT, only trade amounts are used and the two sets of reported indices seem to be
reasonably in accordance for all countries. Since correlations of VIIT indices based
on report country and partner countries are high, it is reasonable to use an average of
the VIIT index of a report country and the partner country as the report country as
our measure of VIIT. According to our data, VIIT is the more dominant type of IIT
within European trade. Calculating the fraction of VIIT of total IIT, we found an
average of 81%.</p>
        <p>In Table 2, the average bilateral VIIT from 1996 to 2005 is shown. On the
one hand, countries such as Germany, France and Great Britain have a relatively
high VIIT with the European countries as a whole. These countries are
characterized by being at the same economic and cultural level and by being
large economies. The bilateral VIIT between these countries is at a higher level
than with other countries. On the other hand, countries such as Greece, Portugal,
Finland, Ireland, Poland and Slovakia have a relatively low bilateral VIIT.
Furthermore, it appears from Table 2 that geographical proximity matters.
Countries far from each other have lower VIIT than countries close to each
other.</p>

      <title>5 Explanatory variables and hypothesis</title>
      <p>In this section, we operationalize the following explanatory variables: factor
endowment, production size, proximity, income distribution overlap and average
GDP.
5.1 Explanatory variables</p>
      <sec id="sec-6-1">
        <title>5.1.1 Income distribution overlap</title>
        <p>A measure of the income distribution overlap between two countries is calculated
as follows: Let p1 denote the proportion of the population in the poorer country
that has an income below the 20% quintile of the income distribution of the richer
country. Furthermore, let p2 denote the proportion of the population in the richer
country that has an income above the 80% quintile of the income distribution in
the poorer country. If the income distribution overlap is small, then both p1 and p2
will be large. If income distributions are identical, i.e. with full overlap, then both
p1 and p2 will be 20%. As a measure of income distribution overlap, INCO, we
calculate
p1þp2
2</p>
        <p>0:2
INCO ¼ 1
0:7</p>
        <p>The factor 0.7 in the denominator is due to the calculation of p1 and p2 from
income distribution data that are in the form of deciles. Then the maximum of p1
and p2 is 0.9. In practice, the minimum value of INCO is 0 indicating virtually
no overlap in income distributions. If income distributions are identical, then
INCO is 1.</p>
        <p>
          Income distribution data for the European countries are calculated partly from
income share data (household disposal income earned within each decile) in World
Income Inequality Database (WIID 2C) for a single year (around 1999 for most
countries) and partly from GDP per capita data from OECD in 2000 dollars and
purchasing power parties (PPP). From the two sources deciles of income
distribution can be interpolated. A similar calculation is used by

          , we decompose capital
into three variables: physical capital, technological capital and human capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          We measure the endowment of human capital by the fraction of the population,
25–64 years of age that has attained at least upper secondary education. This is a
commonly used measure of human capital; see e.g.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Barro and Lee (1993)</xref>
          ,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Mora
(2002)</xref>
          and Gullstrand (2002a, b). Data is from Eurostat’s Internet database for the
period from 1996 to 2005. Accordingly, the difference in the endowment of human
capital, DHKL, is measured by the absolute difference between the fraction of the
population that has attained at least upper secondary education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technological capital, TK, is measured by the cumulated value of R&amp;D
expenditures, see e.g.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Coe and Helpman (1995)</xref>
          and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Mora (2002)</xref>
          , and is calculated
by the use of the perpetual inventory method as follows
        </p>
        <p>TKt ¼ ð1</p>
        <p>dÞTKt 1 þ RDEt 1</p>
        <p>TKt is the technological capital for the year t, and d is the depreciation rate which
is assumed to be 15%.5 RDE is R&amp;D expenditure estimated in 2000 US$ and PPP
and is based on data from the OECD. The initial technological capital stock, TK0, is
calculated as</p>
        <p>TK0 ¼ RDE0=ð1 þ dÞ
where RDE0 is R&amp;D expenditure in the first year, and l is the average annual
logarithmic growth rate of R&amp;D expenditures over the analyzed period. The
technological capital for each year is divided by the level of employment to obtain
the technological capital stock per worker, TKL. Thereby, the difference in the
endowment of technological capital can be measured by the absolute difference in
technological capital per worker, DTKL.</p>
        <p>
          The physical capital per worker, PKL, is in 2000 US$ and PPP. As in
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">Leamer
(1984)</xref>
          the physical capital is measured by the depreciated sum of cumulated gross
domestic investment using the perpetual inventory method. We use data from 1970
to 2007 from the OECD, and the depreciation rate is 7%.6 Thereby, the difference in
the endowment of physical capital can be measured by the absolute difference in
physical capital per worker, DPKL.

the total industrial production of all the analyzed countries, p. Accordingly, we
measure the production size of a country by the country’s share of the total

interaction between difference in income distribution within countries (measured as

the effect of AGDPC to depend on INCO. The sign of the interaction will be
determined empirically.
5.2 Model
Some of the explanatory variables from the present panel data set are
timedependent (DPKL, AGDPC, INCO, DHKL and DTKL) while others are
timeinvariant (ASP and DISTANCE). Since VIIT is bounded between 0 and 100%, a
linear model will not guarantee expected values between these limits. Consequently,
a logistic transformation of VIIT is employed. The data are analyzed by means of
(mixed) linear models of the form
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(see e.g. Frees 2004)</xref>
          :

        <p>VIITit
¼ yit ¼ X1itb1i þ X2ib2 þ ai þ eit
ð5Þ
in which i is an index of country pair and t is an index of time. X1 is a row
vector of the time dependent variables, and X2 is a row vector of the time
independent variables (including a constant to capture an intercept). ai captures
country pair-specific effects (omitted time-invariant explanatory variables), and e
is a stochastic residual. The models cannot handle the extreme values 0 and 100%,
but such values do not occur in the data set. According to the model, the
regression coefficients in b1i may eventually depend on the variable country pair.
Hence, the model permits interaction between country pair and the time-dependent
explanatory variables.

      <title>6 Econometric estimations</title>
      <p>
        A problem with panel data models, as specified in model (5), is the possible
correlation between a and the explanatory variables
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(see e.g. Hausman and Taylor
1981)</xref>
        . Treating a as a random variable (a variance component), generalized least
squares (GLS), in the case of correlation between a and the explanatory variables,
results in biased and inconsistent estimates of regression coefficients
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Hausman and
Taylor 1981)</xref>
        . A possible solution to overcome such a problem is to use so-called
‘‘within’’ estimates of regression coefficients where the ai’s are treated as fixed
constants that enter the model in the form of dummy variables. These ‘‘within’’
estimates are unbiased and consistent even in the presence of correlation between a
and the explanatory variables. However, by this procedure it is not possible to
estimate effects of the time-invariant explanatory variables. Then if the analysis
indicates correlation between a and the explanatory variables, a robust estimation
procedure has to be sought out. Yet another problem with panel data models of type
(5) is the possibility of heteroscedasticity of the residual e as well as correlations of
some form among country pair residuals. We address this problem by using robust
standard errors
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25 ref34">(White 1980; Liang and Zeger 1986)</xref>
        in the estimation of standard
errors. In some of the models, we allow for serial correlation. All the models are
estimated by maximum likelihood.
      </p>
      <p>
        The results of the econometric estimations are shown in Table 3 with a dispersion
factor d = 15%, and in Table 4 with a dispersion factor d = 25%. In column (1) in
Table 3, a model neglecting the variance component a is estimated by OLS. In case
of no correlation between a and the explanatory variables, OLS will result in
unbiased and consistent estimates of regression coefficients, although standard
errors of the estimates are upward biased and thus not reliable. In case of correlation
between a and the explanatory variables, the estimates are biased and inconsistent
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Hausman and Taylor 1981)</xref>
        . In column (2) ‘‘within’’ estimates are displayed. The
large discrepancies between the two sets of estimates indicate a problem with
correlation between a and the explanatory variables. In column (3) GLS estimates
are shown. A Hausman specification test
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Hausman 1978)</xref>
        based on a model (fixed
effect and random component) with homoscedacity and no serial correlation has a
v2-value of 15.29. With 6 degrees of freedom the p-value is 0.018 thus indicating a
problem with correlation between a and the explanatory variables. Accordingly, the
models (1) and (3) can not serve as reference for inference concerning effects of the
explanatory variables.
      </p>
      <p>Since model (2) does not permit time-invariant explanatory variables, we
estimate an ‘‘augmented’’ regression model (4)</p>
      <p>
        yit ¼ X1itb1 þ X2ib2 þ mi þ X1ic þ eit
where X1i is a row vector of averages with respect to time of the time-dependent
explanatory variables
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref14 ref15">(Frees 2001, 2004, see also Arellano 1993)</xref>
        . One may interpret
this model as a model that specifies the dependency of a on the time-dependent
variables as ai ¼ X1ic þ mi.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(See also Hsiao 2003)</xref>
        . Using GLS estimation in this
model results in estimators that are robust to time constant omitted variables bias

specification test. Furthermore, since we use robust standard errors in the estimation
of c, this test is more robust to violation of model assumptions (homoscedasticity
and no serial correlation). Clearly, from Table 3 the c-vector can not be assumed to
be the zero vector. We further note that the ‘‘within’’ estimate and the ‘‘augmented’’
estimate of the vector b1 are equal
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref15">(Frees 2001, 2004)</xref>
        . Some minor discrepancies in
Table 3 are due to the estimation routine.
      </p>
      <p>Judged from model (4) in Table 3, DISTANCE has a negative effect on VIIT.
Thus hypothesis H4 is supported by the data. As regards the effect of ASP and
INCO on VIIT, the signs of the coefficients are as expected and also significant in
these models and thereby offering support for hypothesis H1 and H3. The effect of
AGDPC on VIIT is also significant and positive. On the one hand, AGDPC interacts
significantly with our measure of income distribution overlap, INCO. The negative
interaction implies that the positive effect on VIIT of a larger income distribution
overlap between a country pair levels off when average income of the country pair
increases. On the other hand, the positive effect of AGDPC decreases with larger
income distribution overlap. In fact, since the regression coefficients for AGDPC
and the interaction between INCO and AGDPC are of the same size but of a
different sign, a maximum value of INCO (=1) implies no effect of AGDPC. As
regards the effects of differences in factor endowments these are positive except the
effect of DPKL but not significant. The results of models (2) and (4) indicate that
differences in factor endowments have a minor influence on VIIT.</p>
      <p>In order to further investigate the effects of differences in factor endowments we
set up a model allowing for serial correlation (AR (1)) and variable slopes (random
coefficients) as regards DTKL and DPKL. The random slopes can be expressed as
b ? di with b as the fixed part and di as a random component with mean zero. Thus
b is the average slope and di is the difference between the average slope and
the slope for country pair i. None of the variance components are significant (results
not shown). Hence we do not find support for hypothesis H2, i.e. the effect of
differences in factor endowments on VIIT does not depend on trade partners.
Model (5) takes account of serial correlation and reveals practical identical results
as model (4).</p>
      <p>In Table 3, some fit-measures are supplied in order to choose the ‘‘best’’ model
for inference. R2 is a pseudo coefficient of determination, calculated as the squared
correlation between the dependent variable y and the estimated values of y based on
fixed (non-random) effects. Since the country pair level in model (2) is included, the
value of R2 is very high but at the expense of many parameters. Without the country
pair level the value is 0.026. This shows that the included time-dependent
explanatory variables have only a small effect on VIIT. As a fit measure that also
takes into account the number of parameters of the fitted model is Baysian
information criterion (BIC), calculated as</p>
      <p>BIC ¼</p>
      <p>2 log likelihood þ number of parameters logðN*Þ
where N* is the number of subjects or country pairs (=153). A smaller value
indicates a better and more parsimonious model. In this sense, model (5) in Table 3
is the best model among the relevant models (2), (4) and (5) indicating that
inference concerning effects should be performed in model (5).</p>
      <p>In order to investigate the robustness of the conclusions to different choices of
dispersion factor, results for d = 25% are shown in Table 4. The conclusions
regarding the effect of the explanatory variables are the same as with d = 15%.</p>

      <title>7 Conclusions</title>
      <p>Using panel data methods, we conducted an econometric analysis of intra-industry
trade with vertically differentiated products among the EU-15 countries and four
East European countries: Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic. We
investigated the effect of differences in factor endowments and other determinants
that emerge from theory: income distribution overlap, average income, share of the
total industrial production and geographical proximity.</p>
      <p>We find that differences in factor endowments seem not to be important as a
driving force behind VIIT for European countries in the period 1996–2005. More
important driving forces are production size, geographical proximity, average
income per capita and income distribution overlap. Countries characterized by being
on a high economic level and by being large economies have a higher bilateral VIIT
with each other than with other countries. Furthermore, countries with large income
distribution overlap tend to have a large VIIT. Finally, countries far from each other
have lower VIIT than countries close to each other.</p>
