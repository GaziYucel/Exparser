        <p>Sport's historic attraction for policy makers has been its claims that it can offer an economy of remedies to seemingly intractable social problems-“social inclusion”, “development”. Such usually vague and ill-defined claims reflect sport's marginal policy status and its attempts to prove its more general relevance. The dominance of evangelical beliefs and interest groups, who tend to view research in terms of affirmation of their beliefs, is restricting conceptual and methodological development of policy and practice. There is a need to de-reify “sport” and to address the issue of sufficient conditions-the mechanisms, processes and experiences which might produce positive impacts for some participants. This requires researchers and practitioners to develop approaches based on robust and systematic programme theories. However, even if systematic and robust evidence is produced for the relative effectiveness of certain types of programme, we are left with the problem of displacement of scope-the process of wrongly generalising micro level (programme) effects to the macro (social). Although programme rhetoric frequently claims to address social issues most programmes have an inevitably individualist perspective. Further, as participation in sport is closely related to socially structured inequalities, it might be that rather than sport contributing to “social inclusion”, various aspects of social inclusion may precede such participation. In this regard academics and researchers need to adopt a degree of scepticism and to reflect critically on what we and, most especially, others might already know. There is a need to theorise sportfor-change's limitations as well as its “potential”.</p>

        <title>1. Inflated and Vague Promises</title>
        <p>
          Despite claims that sport-for-development or
sport-forchange is “new”, the historic rationale for investment
in sport has consistently been based on supposed
externalities—sport’s presumed ability to teach “lessons
for life”, to contribute to “character building”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 2006)</xref>
          and its supposed ability to contribute to the reduction of
a variety of social problems. Sport’s attraction for policy
makers has been a perception that it can offer an
economy of remedies to seemingly intractable social
problems (e.g., crime, “social inclusion”, “development”).
Despite the absence of systematic, robust
supportive evidence
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref7">(Coalter, 2007; President’s Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports, 2006)</xref>
          , sports evangelists
have made wide-ranging, if rather vague and
illdefined, claims about sport’s capacity to address issues
of personal and social development. In part this
reflects Weiss’s (1993) contention that inflated promises
are most likely to occur in marginal policy areas which
are seeking to gain legitimacy and funding from
mainstream agencies. For example, Houlihan and White
(2002) contend that sport tends to be opportunistic
and reactive—a policy taker and not a policy maker. In
such circumstances “holders of diverse values and
different interests have to be won over, and in the
process a host of inflated and unrealistic goal
commitments are made” (Weiss, 1993, p. 96).
        </p>
        <p>
          These processes were given a major boost by two
broad shifts in social policy in the late 1990s. Firstly,
starting in the UK, but soon spreading worldwide
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref4">(Bloom, Grant, &amp; Watt, 2005; The Australian Sports
Commission, 2006)</xref>
          , was a shift from the traditional
welfare approach of developing sport in the community, to
seeking to develop communities through sport
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Coalter,
2007)</xref>
          as sport promoted itself as being able to
contribute to the new, ill-defined, “social inclusion” agenda.
        </p>
        <p>The second opportunity arose with the United
Nations’ embrace of sport to support the achievement of
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Like the
concept of social inclusion, the MDGs shifted the focus
of investment from economic capital to social capital,
with a focus on personal and “social inclusion” issues—
strengthening education, improving community safety
and social cohesion, helping girls and women and
youth at risk and addressing issues of public health
(including HIV and AIDS) (Kidd, 2008). Such
peoplecentred objectives resonated with many of sport’s
traditional claims about contributing to personal and social
development. However, as with social inclusion, the
concept of sport-for-development remains “intriguingly
vague and open for several interpretations” (Kruse,
2006, p. 8).</p>
        <p>Kruse’s comment indicates that, despite sport’s
new opportunities (and its opportunism), there are a
number of unresolved issues with the assertions made
by the conceptual entrepreneurs of sport-for-change.
For example, Coakley (2011, p. 307) argues much of
the rhetoric of sports evangelists can be viewed as
“unquestioned beliefs grounded in wishful thinking”.
Hartmann and Kwauk (2011, pp. 285-286) refer to
“anecdotal evidence, beliefs about the impact of sport in
sound bites of individual and community
transformation, packaged and delivered more often than not
by those running the programs”.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-1-2">
        <title>2. From Faith to Theory</title>
        <p>Firstly, the presumed developmental impacts and
outcomes of such programmes tend to be vague,
illdefined and lack the clarity and intellectual coherence
that evaluation criteria should have. There is a general
conceptual weakness, with a widespread failure to
offer precise definitions of “sport”; a failure to consider
the nature, extent and duration of participation to
achieve presumed impacts; the precise nature of
individual impacts (i.e., the effect of sport on participants)
and the nature of their presumed causal relationship
with outcomes (the resulting individual behaviour
change). Such variety and lack of precision raise
substantial issues of validity and comparability and reduce
greatly the possibility of cumulative research findings.
This conceptual imprecision is accompanied by
methodological weaknesses. It must be admitted there
are generic methodological difficulties in defining and
measuring the impacts and outcomes of many social
interventions and attributing cause and effect in any
simple and straightforward way. However, such basic
issues of social science methods are often ignored,
especially by the evangelists. In part this is because some
view research in terms of affirmation rather than
understanding or critique. In the words of Johan Koss,
President of Right to Play, “we invite people to do
research into things like sport and development, sport
and peace. We need to prove what we say that we do”
(van Kampen, 2003, p. 15). Or, UNICEF (2006, p. 1)
arguing that there was “a shared belief in the power of
sport-for-development [and] a shared determination to
find ways to document and objectively verify the
positive impact of sport”.</p>
        <p>
          These beliefs exist despite the existence of an
extensive body of sport and related research which raises
fundamental questions about the validity of the overly
generalised assertions about sport’s capacity to
achieve certain developmental impacts
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Coalter, 2007)</xref>
          .
It is significant that such research is frequently ignored
on the basis of the spurious, legitimating, claim that
this is a “new” area of policy and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          More fundamentally and related to the lack of
clarity is the issue of sufficient conditions. Participation in
“sport”, however defined and however provided, is a
necessary but not sufficient condition to obtain any
supposed benefits. In this regard
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Coakley (1998</xref>
          , p. 2)
argues that we need to regard “sports as sites for
socialisation experiences, not causes of socialisation
outcomes” and Hartmann (2003, p. 134) argues that “the
success of any sports-based social intervention
program is largely determined by the strength of its
nonsport components”. It might be argued that the
widespread use of sport plus approaches
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Coalter, 2007)</xref>
          indicates a recognition of the developmental limits of
“sport”. Consequently, there is a need for more
systematic, analytical information about the various
mechanisms, processes and experiences associated
with participation in “sport”. We require a better
understanding about what sports and sports’ processes,
produce what impacts, for which participants and in
what circumstances. One possible approach to such
issues is provided by a theory of change (Granger, 1998),
or programme theory
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11 ref8 ref9">(Coalter, 2013a; Pawson, 2006;
Weiss, 1997)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>A programme theory seeks to identify the
components, mechanisms, relationships and sequences of
causes and effects which programme providers presume
lead to desired impacts and outcomes—a theory of
value, attitude and behaviour change. It seeks to
understand the nature of sufficient conditions—the processes
and experiences necessary to maximise the potential to
achieve desired impacts. Such an approach:
 Assists in the formulation of theoretically
coherent, realistic and precise impacts related to
programme processes and participants;
 Enables the identification of critical success
factors enabling a more informed approach to
programme design and management;
 Explores potentially generic mechanisms, thus
providing a basis for generalisation in order to
inform future programme design.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-1-3">
        <title>3. Displacement of Scope and Structural Inequalities</title>
        <p>
          However, even if systematic and robust evidence is
produced for the relative effectiveness of certain types
of programme, even if we can identify the generic
mechanisms which enable some programmes to
contribute to the personal development of some
participants
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref8 ref9">(Coalter, 2013b; Pawson, 2006)</xref>
          , we are left with
the problem of displacement of scope (Wagner, 1964).
This refers to the process of wrongly generalising micro
level (programme) effects to the macro (social). This in
part relates to old debates within social science about
the relationship between the individual and the social,
or even between values, attitudes, intentions and
behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>Although programme rhetoric frequently claims to
address social issues—crime, social exclusion,
“development”—most programmes have an essentially, and
inevitably, individualist perspective. Weiss (1993, p.
103) suggests that many social interventions fail
because they are “fragmented, one-service-at-a-time
programs, dissociated from people’s total patterns of
living”. Further, Weiss’s (1993, p. 105) more general
comment about social policy interventions and their
“blame the victim” perspectives can be viewed within
the context of sport-for-change programmes:
We mount limited-focus programs to cope with
broad-gauge problems. We devote limited
resources to long-standing and stubborn problems.
Above all we concentrate attention on changing the
attitudes and behaviour of target groups without
concomitant attention to the institutional
structures and social arrangements that tend to keep
them “target groups”.</p>
        <p>
          In relation to such structural issues the work of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">Wilkinson and Pickett (2009)</xref>
          raises even more fundamental
issues. Their core argument relates to the central
importance of the relative inequality of income and low
levels of social mobility in explaining a range of social
problems. Their data illustrate that many of the
problems commonly associated with social exclusion (and
to which sport offers solutions)—crime, obesity, poor
general health, poor educational performance, weak
community cohesion—are strongly correlated with
societal levels of relative inequality, with more equal
countries having much lower levels of such problems.
Further, it is clear that sports participation is related to
structural issues underpinning social inclusion. For
example, van Bottenburg, Rijnen, &amp; van Sterkenburg (2005)
illustrate that the level of educational achievement is
the most important determinant of sports behaviour.
Also given the very strong relationship between social
class and educational opportunity, it is not surprising
that there is a strong relationship between social class
and sports participation. Also, the level of female
sports participation is clearly strongly correlated with
the relative status of women in society
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref8 ref9">(Coalter, 2013c;
van Bottenburg et al., 2005)</xref>
          —one which is closely
related to levels on inequality.
        </p>
        <p>Such consistent relationships between social
structure and sports participation have led one major
international review of the effectiveness of sports policy
interventions (Nicholson, Hoye &amp; Houlihan, 2011, p. 305)
to conclude that:</p>
        <p>It is evident…that government policies designed to
increase sports participation have had limited
success….Some have had success…within small
communities or specific cohorts…[but] the same level of
success has not been apparent within the mass
population….It is also clear that governments and
researchers don’t know enough about the way in
which complex systems of organisations function to
either induce or disrupt sports participation
patterns.</p>
        <p>Such persistent differentials raise important issues for
policies of ‘sport and social inclusion’, whose success
depends on achieving the necessary condition of increased
participation in sport by many socially marginal and
consistently “under-participating” groups. In this regard van
Bottenburg et al. (2005, p. 208) raise significant
questions about using sport to address social issues via an
individualistic perspective, by arguing that exercise and
sport are thoroughly social phenomena and that “the
choice to take part in sport, how, where, what and with
whom is directly related to the issue of how people see
and wish to present themselves…socio-culturally
determined views and expectations also play a role here”.</p>
        <p>The broad conclusion to be drawn from the above
analyses is to reverse the current fashion for arguing
that sport can contribute to increased “social inclusion”
and suggests that various aspects of social inclusion
precede such participation. Further, even if sport
provides some degree of individual amelioration for some
of these problems, Wilkinson and Pickett (2009, p. 26)
offer a salutary warning about neo-Liberal,
individualized approaches to such problems:</p>
        <p>Even when the various services are successful in
stopping someone reoffending…getting someone
off drugs or dealing with educational failure, we
know that our societies are endlessly re-creating
these problems in each new generation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-1-4">
        <title>4. A Need for Scepticism</title>
        <p>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">Black (2010</xref>
          , p. 122) argues that the recent expansion of
sport-for-development policy and practice has not been
underpinned by “critical and theoretically-informed
reflection” and others have suggested that there is a need
to step back and to reflect critically on what we and,
most especially, others might already know
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Coakley,
2011; Crabbe, 2008; Tacon, 2007)</xref>
          . In this regard Portes
(2000, p. 4) argues that “gaps between received theory
and actual reality have been so consistent as to
institutionalize a disciplinary skepticism in sociology against
sweeping statements, no matter from what ideological
quarter they come”. The need for scepticism is nowhere
more relevant than in the area of sport-for-change. Such
an approach can contribute to the intellectual and
practical development of sport-for-development by placing it
within a much wider world of knowledge and research
and by theorising its limitations as well as outlining its
“potential”.
