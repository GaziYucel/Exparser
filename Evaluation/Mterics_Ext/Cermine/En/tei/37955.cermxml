      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) … is a holistic, all encompassing data
collection exercise about a whole community. The research process is put
as far as possible into the hands of ordinary people. Although ‘experts’
(the community educators) are involved, their role is to facilitate, not take
over, the investigation. It has very practical goals. The aim of the inquiry
is to obtain a detailed understanding and analysis of a specific local
context; then for local people to prioritise their needs based on this enhanced
understanding. The outcome of this process is a community action plan,
devised with a view to helping local communities solve their own
problems through different local initiatives. The PRA embraces diversity. It
can be applied in a range of adult education contexts, such as health,
agriculture, biodiversity and urban planning. It is used to address specific
African problems such as desertification, low food production, declining
productivity and fuelwood shortage. PRA, then, is: ‘built on the premise
that participation by the beneficiaries in any project is fundamental’ and
that ‘locally developed technologies are more likely to succeed’ in
building community confidence and capacity
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Egerton University 2000, 4)</xref>
        . Its
strategy is to encourage the use of local cultural values, organisations and
knowledge systems for solving problems. The community is involved in
every stage of the PRA process
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Chilisa/Preece 2005: 198)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>PRA emanated from countries in the global South1 as a strategy to involve
poor rural communities in their own development. Drawing on relevant
literature this paper will explore to what extent PRA lives up to its rhetoric, and
how effectively it contributes to sustainable outcomes. The paper will also
explore what lessons we can learn about PRA and its applicability as a
methodology for marginalised social groups in European contexts. We begin with
a brief introduction to the evolution of PRA as a participatory methodology.</p>

      <title>2. Evolution of participatory methodologies</title>
      <p>
        Traditional research approaches are often criticised for failing to address
issues of ownership and control or power relations between the ‘expert
academic’ and practitioner or layperson involved in the study
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Green et al.
1995)</xref>
        . Countries from the so called developing world have particularly
voiced their concerns about the way powerful outsiders investigate local
communities with only partial knowledge of local contexts
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Mulenga 1999)</xref>
        .
The concept of participatory research, as an antidote to these criticisms, has
evolved from a number of directions. On the one hand development agencies
and policymakers who sought quick access to socio economic data were
responding to critiques of trickle down economic development theory and
concerns about top-down development without consultation with local
communities
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref15 ref4">(Boyde 2000; Campbell 2002; Hayward et al. 2004)</xref>
        ; on the other hand
1
      </p>
      <p>
        The global South is one of many terms given to countries such as Africa and Asia
which are seen as in need of development aid. All terms have derogatory and
sometimes inaccurate connotations. It was felt that this particular term is less offensive than
other ones currently in use, whilst recognising that no term accurately describes such a
range of countries or their circumstances.
communities themselves have increased their demands to be included in
decisions that affected their daily lives
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Hayward et al. 2004)</xref>
        . Furthermore, in the
past decade there has been increasing emphasis on the need to respect
multiple voices and a reluctance among researchers to speak for the ‘other’ in
contexts where there were significant power differentials between the researcher
and the researched
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Cottrell and Parpart 2006)</xref>
        . Collaboration and
participation have now become an ethical issue in their own right, particularly for the
poor and marginalised:
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for pro-poor development to become a reality, poor people
themselves must be not only involved as respondents, but also have access to
the information generated, a role in its analysis and in identifying the
practical implications for change
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Chambers/Mayoux 2005: 7)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Gray et al. (2000: 244) argue that the philosophical commitment to
participatory research has been influenced by these two traditions – third world
development and action research – now ‘subsumed under the unifying umbrella of
participatory research’. Participatory methods claimed to produce knowledge
that was more valid and reliable in representing context specific ways of
knowing the social world
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Campbell 2002)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The range of terminologies that come under this unifying umbrella are
considerable. They include: participatory research, participatory action
research, action research, collaborative enquiry, emancipatory research and
participatory rural appraisal amongst others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Green et al. 1995)</xref>
        . They are seen as
being positioned within a range of radical theories such as neo-Marxism,
critical theory and feminist frameworks
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Mulenga 1999)</xref>
        .
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">Fox (2006)</xref>
        suggests
that many of these research terms are complementary but different in their
approach and purpose. They seem to lie along a continuum of radical to
liberal goals. At the more radical end he includes amongst them such terms as
‘power-structure research’- as pioneered in Latin America. Here the goal is to
reveal injustices and pressure points in the system that causes these injustices
so people’s anger will provoke them into targeted action
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Fox 2006: 27)</xref>
        . On
the other hand he sees the ‘testimonial research’ of many feminist scholars as
a means of enabling marginalised voices and histories to be heard, so that the
‘other’ is better understood in context. Other participatory research may be
focused on making invisible problems visible, so as to redefine what counts
Participatory Rural Appraisal 201
as a problem and enable us to see, for example, that environmental threats are
intertwined with issues of race or class. But there is a common goal of all
these terms to shift the focus away from the researcher, who simply raises
awareness amongst the researched, to a goal of mutual learning and agenda
sharing amongst researchers and participants.
      </p>
      <p>So what are the distinctive features of participatory rural appraisal? And
does it achieve what it claims to do?</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>3. Participatory rural appraisal</title>
      <p>
        To answer these questions we must briefly explore the origins of the term and
look at some of its characteristics. Southern contexts such as Latin America
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Percy 1999)</xref>
        and Africa
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref9">(De Vos 1998 and Mulenga 1999)</xref>
        are often cited as
the source of participatory research as a response to development methods
that were being overshadowed by neo-colonial interference:
      </p>
      <p>
        Critics of African development such as Julius Nyerere of Tanzania argued
that any meaningful development could only be achieved if the people’s
culture and popular knowledges were integrated into the process
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Mulenga
1999: 3)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        There were problems with the term participatory research in African
development contexts, however. Development agencies were using the word
tokenistically without transferring any real ownership of the research process or
its outcomes. Centralised, top down approaches to development had left the
rural poor increasingly dependent on public provision with no sense of
ownership over their own destiny
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Chilisa/Preece 2005: 197)</xref>
        . Since 2002
decentralised governance systems in many countries have provided the impetus to
cascade decision making responsibilities down to local communities. This
required in most cases a re-training of institutional officers to build confidence
in community leadership structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        To facilitate this transition, participatory rural appraisal was offered as a
response to policy maker and aid agency needs for quick access to socio
economic data at local levels
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Campbell 2002)</xref>
        . Drawing on Chambers’ work,
Campbell (2002: 21) states that it embodies five principles: to function as a
trade-off between the traditional preference for quantifiable data and the
reality need to collect relevant information; to counteract the biases of
development tourism; to serve as a triangulation method; to provide a flexible way of
learning directly from and with rural people; and to be an interactive process
that embraces diversity and multiple realities. The goal of PRA is to
maximise the skills, knowledge, expertise and analytical skills of village
communities through a process of data collection, discussion of issues and possible
solutions and the creation of an agreed community action plan that will not
only include action by community members themselves, but also engage
officials over an agreed timescale. Sometimes the community may raise a
particular problem, but more often than not a change agent initiates the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people engaged in PRA are not necessarily trained researchers, as the
case studies cited in the latter part of this paper demonstrate. Often, therefore,
there is a requirement that officials, such as extension workers in rural
communities, have to review their whole approach to their development
responsibilities. Instead of seeing farmers or other client groups as mere recipients of
new techniques or information provided by the extension workers, for
instance, the participatory appraisal approach requires a new form of
engagement, whereby extension workers listen and farmers articulate their local
knowledge in a shared process of learning and working together to look for
solutions to identified problems
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Percy 1999)</xref>
        . It is sometimes argued that the
main gain from this process is what the researcher-facilitators learn about
their clients’ own skills and understanding, rather than new technical
knowledge that can guide the goal for change or development
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Doyle/Krasny
2003)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        PRA has now evolved into a methodology for use in a variety of situations
including urban communities, and it is often now simply known as
participatory appraisal
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(PEANuT 2005)</xref>
        . While its primary goal is to transfer
ownership of knowledge creation to communities, it does more than simply gather
data, however, since action is the intended outcome. There is an explicit aim
to reduce the distance between the researcher and the researched
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Gray et al.
2000)</xref>
        and the research process has come to be defined as:
      </p>
      <p>
        Systematic inquiry, with the collaboration of those affected by the issue
being studied, for the purposes of education and taking action or effecting
social change
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Green et al. 1995: 54)</xref>
        .

      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>The process</title>
        <p>
          The goal of the participatory appraisal (PA) process is to be as inclusive as
possible in collecting views from across the community population. This
usually involves several people acting as facilitators, rather than interaction with
one researcher. Data collection techniques are designed to be useable
amongst communities where literacy levels are low. PA has been described
as embracing a family of methods and approaches that involve group based
learning and planning, using different techniques to investigate an issue from
several different angles
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Kapoor 2002)</xref>
          . The aim is to gradually build up a
knowledge base of whole communities through visual activities, walks,
discussions, role play, interviews, photos, seasonal calendars, diagrams –
exploring what people think, how they live their lives and specific cultural
domains of those lives. By recording information from such a diverse range of
techniques, and feeding back to community members they are challenged to
consider perspectives other than their own in the effort to find common
solutions. Many of the techniques are borrowed from qualitative social research,
though the emphasis is on visual and group data, rather than individualised
information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Handbooks for conducting the PA process are documented from a variety
of sources
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref24">(for example Egerton University 2000; Trust for Community
Outreach and Education 2001; Chambers 2002)</xref>
          . Although diversity and
flexibility is encouraged there is a recommended approach that maximises
community involvement. The Egerton University PRA Field Handbook (2000, 4)
proposed eight steps for an external facilitator in the African village context,
in the following order: site selection; preliminary site visits to establish
contact and build relationships; public announcement of activities through
traditional information dissemination meetings; data gathering; data collation and
analysis; preparation of the community action plan; adoption of the plan and
strategies for its implementation; and then ongoing participatory monitoring
and evaluation. Community members are usually recruited as co-research
facilitators, and also to bridge communication gaps with various population
sectors. Whilst the notion of ‘community’, for these purposes, originated as a
‘village community’ it may in different contexts be translated more broadly
as, for example, business community
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Michaels et al 2001)</xref>
          or special interest
group community
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Taylor 1999)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Data is collected over an extended period. Since this is done in a variety
of ways it is often fragmented and needs to be organised by the facilitators,
whilst allowing the community members themselves to make sense of the
whole. It is often the style of data collection which gives participatory
appraisal its distinctive feel. Maps are often constructed out of local materials
on the ground and only copied onto paper once they are completed. The map
evolves through discussion and identification of particular issues. A ‘transect
map’ is effectively a walking map, where community members walk through
a particular area and talk about various landmarks or activities. In similar
fashion, people can discuss interagency links by physically grouping
themselves into large Venn diagrams drawn on the ground, using coloured ribbon
or other resources to signify connections or communication links, depending
on the community context
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Michaels et al. 2001)</xref>
          . Other examples of data
collection include timelines that list key events in the life of a community,
seasonal and daily calendars that record activities for men and women,
livelihood maps that list the resources a household needs on a daily basis and
where they collect them from. Issues for men and women are often discussed
separately, revealing the problematics of gendered decision making in one
African context, as the following extract shows:
        </p>
        <p>It was no surprise that the problems which the women raised were
different from those of the men. Shortage of wood for fuel is a major problem
for the women, for example, as they often have to spend many hours
searching for it, and they were therefore very interested in economical
stoves. Traditional harmful practices such as circumcision were also
mentioned by the women.</p>
        <p>
          The men were more interested in training in non-agricultural fields. In
both villages in Oromia, almost half the population no longer have enough
land to be able to live off what it produces. These men, most of whom are
young, have to hire themselves out as wage labourers on other farms,
assuming that they find work at all
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Burkhardt 2000: 310-311)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>Participatory Rural Appraisal 205
During all these activities problems issues and solutions are discussed and
recorded. Occasionally technical data (such as soil testing) is included at the
request of the community.</p>
        <p>If the discussions have been facilitated effectively the causes and potential
solutions to problems will be emerging throughout the process in readiness
for action planning. At this stage community members often divide into
thematic groups to address particular issues in more detail. The PA team
facilitate decision making by drawing attention to the recorded discussions,
including references to solutions that may have worked in the past. Community
action planning is undertaken through the same participative process, including
any identification of training needs that would facilitate action and
monitoring. An example of such a discussion process is taken from the Trust for
Community Outreach and Education (TCOE) Training Manual (2001). This
particular scenario represents the final stages of a community empowerment
process, facilitated by Nondwe, and designed to address poverty issues in a
South African township:</p>
        <p>
          Together they analysed the summaries … After a while clear patterns
began to emerge …. After a short while, as people calmed down, Nondwe
put up a big drawing …. Then she asked … ‘why is there a higher rate of
gastroenteritis among children living on the south side of Umzekelo along
the banks of the river?’ ‘Because they play in the river most often’, said
someone. ‘Yes but who lives there?’ …’the poorest of the poor live in that
area’ … Then Eunice got up again and said: ‘That’s another thing our
investigation revealed. Gastroenteritis is more prevalent in the areas of
greatest poverty in Umzekelo. And infants who get gastroenteritis are
more likely to die from dehydration’ ….With Nondwe’s careful
facilitation, people first began to use their growing understanding of local
conditions
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(TCOE 2001: 185)</xref>
          …All that was left to do now was to plan ….
Several women … said they would like to present a play based on what
they had learnt …Eunice said that she would like to borrow her church
minister’s camera and document the health and sanitation problems
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(TCOE 2001: 191)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          This example demonstrates that the facilitator needs to be highly skilled at
group dynamics, organisation data management and critical awareness
raising. Participatory data collection evolves into participatory education in order
to arrive at collective action for empowerment and change. Freirian notions
of conscientisation or
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">Brookfield’s (1987</xref>
          ) description of critical thinking
would be appropriate pedagogical skills for the facilitator-as-researcher here.
The effectiveness of the process is heavily dependent on how it is managed
by the research leaders.

      <title>4. Critiques of the process</title>
      <p>The rhetoric of participation, empowerment and development and the
potential of the process to produce sustainable outcomes have come under
increasing scrutiny, however. The criticisms relate to methodological, outcome and
ethical concerns.

      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Participation techniques</title>
        <p>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Hayward and Simpson (2004)</xref>
          point out that the experience of participation is
not always a positive experience for the participants in developing countries
in terms of inclusiveness and ownership. Often this reflects poor training on
the part of facilitators who are either trained by or are Westerners. The choice
of technique may reflect the importing of implicit western cultural bias into
different cultural contexts
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Campbell 2002)</xref>
          . Some data gathering tools can
fail to address issues of gender, age or lifestyle
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Boyde 2000)</xref>
          meaning that
the participants themselves often have to learn new skills in order to
participate at all and the nature of the data collected still reflects the goals of the
researchers. Boyde points out that PRA techniques, in their effort to counteract
criticisms of bias in quantitative methods, fail to acknowledge that no data
gathering tool is entirely value free. For example visualisation strategies
designed to enable local people to conduct their own analysis and action plans
may fail to take into account the controlling role that facilitators play in
steering the group deliberations. Similarly group interviews themselves may ‘not
address the problem of selecting members to groups, the composition of the
group, or the role of the moderator’
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Campbell 2002: 24)</xref>
          . In close association
with this concern Green et al (1995) highlight the concern of
representativeness. If only a few self selected individuals take part in the appraisal process
they may purport to represent the views of many when this is not the case.
Participatory Rural Appraisal 207
Chambers and Mayoux (2005: 26) acknowledge that there may be problems
in who participates or people’s willingness to contribute. Campbell sums
these issues up as a lack of transparency in reporting the techniques and
procedures used and lack of flexibility in adjusting to context.
        </p>
        <p>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Boyde (2000)</xref>
          adds to these concerns by pointing out that PRAs are often
conducted by non governmental organisations (NGOs) which are rarely
locally owned so this results in a ‘subtle top-down intervention, controlled and
managed by external forces’ so that participation actually becomes ‘covert
manipulation’ (pages unnumbered). He also reminds us that many of the
problems which communities unearth can be attributed to wider structural
concerns, over which the facilitators of PRA projects have little control.
Sometimes these issues become so large that the process pays insufficient
attention to highlighting local strengths that could solve more focused
problems. At other times there are attempts by researchers to claim more
generalisable outcomes than localised context specific situations can reflect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issue of power relations in PRA methodologies, can therefore be
hidden in the discourse of ‘participatory’, thus re-creating all the problems that
participatory research claims to overcome. For instance
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Kapoor (2002)</xref>
          states
that there is no quality assurance over the PRA process to ensure that
discussions are coercion free or the facilitator is not abusing his or her power and
authority (p.108). Kapoor also points out that it is unclear how PRA provides
opportunities to critique which community claims are erroneous.
Furthermore,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Boyde (2000)</xref>
          ,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Mulenga (1999)</xref>
          and others’ concerns that there is an
inevitable tension between the development practitioner’s values and personal
agendas and those of the more career oriented and institutionally pressurised
academic require a constant trade-off between the ideology of participation
and the reality of the research process.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Cottrell and Parpart (2006)</xref>
          suggest
that frank and open discussions from the beginning may help to resolve some
of these issues.

          Finally
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Kapoor (2002)</xref>
          articulates the concern that participatory appraisal
literature is under-theorised. Although issues of empowerment and
participation are central to its work, there is almost no reference to theoretical notions
of power or democracy. He cites Foucault’s concept of power as a
relationship and the role that power plays in legitimising knowledge. He also refers
to Habermasian literature that discusses deliberative democracy as a strategy
for challenging the state. The absence of such a critical theoretical overview,
he argues, means that ‘difference’ is denied in the pursuit of consensus and
political activism is suppressed in favour of liberalism
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Kapoor 2002: 114f.)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the above criticisms could apply to the mis-use of any
methodology, of course.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Chambers and Mayoux (2005)</xref>
          suggest we should look at the
problem slightly differently. For instance we should ask how reliable is the
alternative – quantitative, top down collected data - in addressing the above
concerns, especially those of power relations and the inter-linkages between
multi-dimensional aspects of poverty
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Chambers/Mayoux 2005: 4)</xref>
          . From
here we can look for ways to enhance the quality of participatory
methodologies, to minimise their deficiencies. Chambers and Mayoux point out that
local people’s knowledge is more useful for community analysis than ‘official’
information. But, as the TCOE extract indicated, there is a need for
appropriate training of facilitators, cultural sensitising and pilot testing of methods.
Also analysis should be ongoing, rather than short, one-off exercises. The
triangulation process is necessary to offset concerns of bias or
representativeness, but the range of tools used need not include diagrams or methods that
are inappropriate for any particular circumstance. Chambers and Mayoux
argue that although empowerment cannot be assumed, the methods, when used
sensitively and correctly have greater potential to increase accountability in
the development process:
        </p>
        <p>
          The main challenge is not rigour, but how to enable the poorest to have a
voice in definitions and policies for pro-poor growth and civil society
development in the face of institutional prejudice against a process which
challenges conventional norms of expertise and power relations

        <p>
          So, they and others argue, it is down to questions of ethics as to whose voices
are taken seriously and to whom the data belongs. Such concerns include
ensuring sensitive community data is not put into the wrong hands – at
community or local government level. Questions that must be asked of the PA
project include: Whose interests are being served? Whose indicators are most
Participatory Rural Appraisal 209
relevant for assessing the development process? Whose numbers count?
Whose analysis is most relevant and reliable? Who needs the information?
Who is most likely to be empowered in the process?

          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Boyde (2000)</xref>
          adds a further question: ‘Is this a search to discover
something from which all parties can learn?’ (pages unnumbered) and invites
us to consider whether the documented outcomes will really help to improve
the situation of the least powerful. In other words, whose voices are being
heard?
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Chambers and Mayoux (2005)</xref>
          also raise the issue of how much
community time it is ethical to demand of people who are using all their energy to
sustain themselves and how much of the data should be removed for analysis
from outside of the community itself. Kapoor, however, points out the danger
of placing so much emphasis on accepting the validity of community data at
the expense of injecting a critical stance into the process:
        </p>
        <p>
          To privilege what is is often to unquestioningly accept the status quo …
can mean simplifying or ignoring broader relationships between say local
communities and socio economic power structures
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Kapoor 2002: 102)</xref>
          .
We can see, therefore, that the participatory appraisal approach requires
sensitivity, cultural awareness, and a commitment to giving voice to the
disadvantaged. At the same time it requires an ethical commitment to respect
diversity and difference whilst also facilitating awareness raising and ultimately
empowerment through highlighting contradictions in people’s stories,
situations and perspectives. The action plan must tread a fine line between too
much or too little control and the creation of realistic agendas for change. In
particular participants must be facilitated in such a way that they learn to
critique themselves and their findings. In adult education terms this cuts across a
Frierian conscientisation process or Habermasian concept of deliberative
democracy, within feminist or similar critical frameworks that are sensitive to
issues of power. An analysis of two case studies taken from very different
situations shows the degree of reflexivity required by researchers if they are
to maintain an ethical balance. They show the trade-offs or compromises as
well as potential for flexibility that participatory appraisal generates and they
also demonstrate the applicability of this approach in widely different
contexts.

      <title>5. Case studies</title>
      <p>
        The author of this paper has used certain aspects of PRA methods as a
researcher
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(see Preece/Ntseane 2003 for example)</xref>
        2 and has also been privy to
discussions amongst rural development government officers in Botswana
about community action plan implementation concerns, and the degree to
which PRA can overcome ethnicity exclusions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Mompati and Prinsen 2000)</xref>
        .
However, recent funding failures have delayed the opportunity for a planned
comparative study in PRA. This paper therefore draws on existing literature
to critique two case studies in an attempt to reflect on the learning that took
place between the researchers and their target participants and the extent to
which action for change took place.
The first example is taken from a World Bank funded project in April 1995
(Massiah 1997). Its significance lies in the fact that this was, at the time, an
innovation for World Bank engagement in non quantitative studies. Its
significance also lies in the extent to which the report could be assessed as
following a community agenda that would result in community owned
outcomes. The report describes the first phase of a project to prevent sexually
transmitted diseases and HIV infection in three communities in Nigeria’s
Plateau State. The research team consisted of personnel from the State Ministry
of Health, AIDS Action Managers in the participating local authorities, a
university academic and representative from the World Bank. University
students who spoke the local languages served as interviewers during the field
work.

      <p>The author was a member of a small team which conducted several open ended focus
group discussions with employees in Botswana based companies where employees
discussed culturally contextual issues, concerns and possible solutions to the country’s
HIV/AIDS pandemic. These responses were then organised into a three-person
dialogue drama that was played back to the focus groups who responded in terms of action
they were prepared to agree with, or not. The author has also participated with African
and British students and academics in a participatory appraisal training workshop
where participants undertook a variety of appraisal activities including thematically
organising and prioritising issues raised by the group, pair ranking and action
planning, visual construction of concepts and producing historical time lines.
Participatory Rural Appraisal 211</p>
      <p>The problem situation identified by the researchers was that HIV and
syphilis prevalence rates in Nigeria were increasing and the Plateau State had
the highest levels in the country. The goal was to collect information about
STD/AIDS that could inform subsequent monitoring activities in the areas.
The criteria for site selection was that each district contained at least one
private or public health facility and was accessible by road. The three sites are
briefly described as follows. Jos North local government authority includes
the capital city and is a prime trading centre for long distance truck drivers. It
also includes two smaller and more traditional communities that have three
different ethnic populations. Mangu local authority has both an urban and
rural settlement with four different ethnic groups and the third local
government authority, Langtang, is primarily rural with limited transport facilities.</p>
      <p>The process of involvement was conducted by the local authority AIDS
Action Managers through village elders who introduced the team to their
communities. The precise means of selecting the target group is not described
in the report (merely saying that ‘participants were selected by their own
communities’ (Massiah 1997: 42), but they consisted of professional health
workers, traditional healers and pharmacists, male and female community
members, long distant truck drivers and STD patients. Interviews with
commercial sex workers and village elders were conducted by the AIDS Action
Managers. Questions related to identifying and prioritising development
concerns and health concerns. A total of 16 data collection methods were used,
including social and institutional mapping, interviews, and matrix ranking.
Data was collected over a period of two weeks.</p>
      <p>Findings were reported bilingually by the team to community meetings, in
the form of participatory workshops consisting of participants in the
fieldwork. The research coordinator summarised the research findings and
community members commented on issues, prioritised and added to them. A key
recommendation in relation to the focus of the study was that health
education should be provided in local languages and be distributed through more
traditional communication routes rather than as posters written in English. A
number of recommendations for decreasing confusions about picture content
in the HIV/AIDS prevention posters were also made. In addition problems of
literacy, education, roads and water supply were highlighted by the
community, along with general health concerns such as malaria. Cultural and
religious norms impacted on health and sexual behaviour generally. An
important recommendation included the need to foster collaboration between
traditional and medical care providers, since community members relied on
traditional healers far more than the professionals had realised.</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>Commentary</title>
        <p>A significant feature of the findings was that the communities themselves did
not rank STDs and HIV/AIDS as their main health concerns:</p>
        <p>In general, women perceive childhood diseases as priorities, and they rank
them higher than men do. Among women, the main health concerns are
measles, dysentery / diarrhea, and hypertension; men’s main health
concerns are meningitis, typhoid, and hernia. Malaria is mentioned more by
men than women ….. Doctors and nurses identify similar health priorities
(Massiah 1997: 16).</p>
        <p>Indeed lack of health care facilities generally were secondary to wider
development concerns related to poverty, such as existence of potable water,
access to credit and agriculture markets (Massiah 1997: 14). Yet the project’s
priorities were STDs and AIDS. This remains the title of the project and these
items are the only ones identified in the report summary. This would suggest
that although the consultation process was adhered to as a strategy, the
research team still filtered out the issues that they intended to spend their
energies on.</p>
        <p>
          Another concern is the nature of who participated. Whilst key people were
identified through traditional community structures, it has already been
highlighted that minority ethnic groups are often marginalised in this process
since traditional expectations of entitlement and participation can intercede.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Mompati and Prinsen (2000)</xref>
          , for instance, describe how the participatory
appraisal process in Botswana resulted in minority ethnic groups and women
being systematically excluded from consultation opportunities, or being
withdrawn from meetings if they spoke out against dominant values. The
World Bank report makes no observation about problems that may have
arisen during consultation processes, other than recognising that the lack of
Participatory Rural Appraisal 213
sustained support at community action planning stages is a reason for failure
to implement changes. Furthermore, whilst the field work of two weeks was
identified as time consuming, reference is not made to the length of time the
workers took to gain access to these communities. Although some of the
teams would have been relatively well known to the communities, some may
not have been, suggesting that barriers of trust may not have fully dissipated
during such a short time-frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless reflection amongst the researchers suggested that the activity
itself had built cross-sectoral partnerships and raised the professionals’
consciousness of their own biases towards community members, a clearer
understanding of the dynamics of community behaviours and interpretation of
health messages, and the potential of communities to identify solutions to
their own problems (Massiah 1997: 2). These latter features were a
significant finding of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">Youngman and Maruatona (1998)</xref>
          during their assessment of a
pilot PRA project in Botswana. A key learning curve for appraisal teams is to
realise that their communities have relevant skills and knowledge and can
actively engage in programme research.
        </p>
        <p>For the community members it was felt that the PRA process had
facilitated new partnerships and lines of accountability though they expressed
scepticism about the likelihood that action would be taken without sufficient
follow-up and input from relevant professionals (Massiah 1997: 2). The issue
of sustainability is highlighted particularly when there is a perceived distance
between the appraisal team and community members themselves. In spite of
its innovatory nature for the World Bank, this project still reflected a top
down structure whose limitations filtered through to the participants
themselves. A theoretical understanding in terms of power relations or group
dynamics was not discussed.

engaged American youth in learning about ethnic gardening practices using
research methods adapted from participatory rural appraisal. The context for
this project focuses on issues of intergenerational and ethnic marginalisation
in poor American urban neighbourhoods. The youth and community
gardeners were low income Puerto Ricans, Hispanic immigrants and African
Americans with roots in the American south:
          </p>
          <p>
            Community gardeners in the US tend to be low-income minorities and
recent immigrants living in apartment buildings in neighbourhoods with
little open space and few grocery stores that carry fresh fruit and vegetables.
They voluntarily work in the gardens, which provide a place to socialize,
relax and appreciate nature, and a means of accessing fresh produce
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Doyle/Krasny 2003: 94)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>The project was stimulated by cooperative extension educators who wanted
to use PRA as an educational/community action tool for local youth from the
same minority backgrounds as the adult community gardeners. The youth
would be trained as PRA researchers to document gardening practices and
then conduct community action based on their results. The idea was to
stimulate interest in ‘urban agro-ecology and food systems’ to compensate for the
lack of grocery stores. The youth in this case were therefore both
researcherfacilitators but also community members who would be expected to
subsequently undertake their own action with their elders. The educators both
trained the youth and maintained a presence throughout the PRA exercise,
sometimes sharing responsibility for the data collection when the youth
encountered difficulties. The self reflection process therefore took place at three
levels – the gardeners, the youth researchers, the educators. Six PRA methods
were used – a visual time-line and interviews to document garden history,
mapping of plots and gardens and seasonal calendar to identify planting
practices, soil tests, Venn diagrams to locate resource flows within the wider
community, followed by a shared action plan between gardeners and youth to
identify problems and solutions. The project took place over several weeks
during the long summer vacation.</p>
          <p>A total of 31 educators involved 85 youth to work with 26 gardeners
across seven neighbourhoods. Youth participants were drawn from
community centres and school gardening programmes serving low-income children.
The project author (Doyle) conducted her own assessment of the total process
through observations, interactions and interviews at the beginning, middle
Participatory Rural Appraisal 215
and end of the programme, supplemented by end of project focus groups and
youth diaries. Ultimately only four sites followed the full PRA process.</p>
          <p>A significant action outcome for the project was that youth at two sites
started their own garden and at a third site youth developed long term
mentoring relationships with their neighbourhood gardeners. They also gave
presentations about their findings to gardeners and community members at a
garden event and county fairs.</p>
          <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">Doyle and Krasny (2003)</xref>
            report that the youth experienced some
challenges in facilitating the more hands-on activities such as mapping and
diagrams and sometimes the educators helped to adapt the processes, for
example by encouraging the youth to interpret the Venn diagram activity as a
‘puzzle about how the people fit together within the garden’ (p.96). There
were also some language and cultural differences between the youth
researchers and minority ethnic community members. More practical issues to
do with time management, transport and attention spans were also cited
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Doyle/Krasny 2003: 103)</xref>
            . The youth found interviewing a more familiar
technique, stimulated by the fact that the gardeners loved telling stories, but
the gardeners felt more awkward when asked to draw a map or diagram.
Nevertheless, they eventually became deeply engaged in mapping their plots,
when the youth started drawing a map and asking gardeners for help in filling
the details. The message here, of course, is to fit methods to context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The expertise of the older, minority ethnic research ‘subjects’ and the age
differentials for the youth researchers suggest that perhaps power differentials
and the subsequent learning processes were unusually complementary in this
project. So, for instance, the youth acquired substantial historical knowledge
about the evolution of the gardens, the influence of surrounding environment
such as pollution on the gardens and connections between the garden and
broader city. They increased their knowledge about soils and soil testing.
Through the necessary listening process of interviewing they were able to
build a relationship with the gardeners. By the same token the educators
learned to respect the young adults’ own ability to take initiative:
I would say [to the youth], ‘Do you want me to go over to the gardener
with you? Do you want me to do anything or just be here?’ They’d say,
‘No, just be here,’ and they’d come back and I’d let them tell me how it
went. …(Educator, Philadelphia)
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Doyle/Krasny 2003: 97)</xref>
            The activities also generated insights about people and emotions associated
with gardening, as well as sustainability issues and the contribution the
products made to the community. From the gardeners’ perspectives the
interactions enhanced their own self respect and feeling of belonging

        <p>Reflections on the total action research process highlighted the difficulties in
balancing a complex set of research, education and community action
objectives. It was felt that the educational outcomes were achieved more
successfully than research outcomes, with consequences for sustainable action.
Equally the ‘total participation’ of youth and gardeners in determining
objectives and devising research questions was subliminated by the educators’
overall control of the whole process, although youth were encouraged to add
research questions of their own. The gardeners themselves were confused
about their role in the exercise, sometimes believing they were teachers rather
than participants in a shared objective. The youths’ own communication and
academic skills varied, with consequent outcomes for their engagement in all
the activities. A general observation was that all participants needed longer
preparation time to fully understand the PRA process.</p>
        <p>This was a complex and ambitious arrangement that made genuine
attempts to involve people who would not normally have a voice in their own
community. It perhaps lacked direction in that the objectives for change were
not clear, and the mutual roles of each layer of participant were not always
understood. Perhaps the greatest gain – as for the World Bank study – was in
the breaking down of misconceptions and inter-generational stereotype
expectations of each other.</p>

      <title>6. Lessons to be learned?</title>
      <p>A number of observations can be made concerning the relevance of literature
arguments about Participatory appraisal in analysing these two case studies.
Participatory Rural Appraisal 217</p>
      <p>
        On the plus side the above cases demonstrate the versatility of the
participatory approach to a variety of situations around the world. The
distinctiveness of participatory rural appraisal – or participatory appraisal (PA) as it is
now coming to be known – originated as a methodology that was applied to
rural communities where literacy levels were low and were people felt
removed from public decision making processes. These issues can be applied
globally to marginalised groups and people whose levels of literacy, or
knowledge of technical language, is less than that of people making decisions
that affect their lives. PA not only broadens the range of strategies available
to low literacy groups. It can also be effective in community mobilisation.
The studies demonstrated the opportunity for data collection partnerships that
would not otherwise have existed and created new dynamics between the
researchers and participants. As a result of these opportunities and dynamics,
knowledge was secured that would otherwise have been hidden (for example,
the extent to which community members in the African context use
traditional healers in relation to conventional medical resources). New knowledge
often then emerges as a re-working of solutions that are context sensitive.
The outcomes should not be overstated, but methods can be used to provide
innovative ways of engaging with marginalised social groups, and adapted to
suit particular circumstances. In addition to the above examples it has been
used in situations that can range from health care situations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Gray et al 2000)</xref>
        ,
to team building
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Michaels et al 2001)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>However, there are some pervading issues. For instance, another
continuing distinctiveness of participatory appraisal from other forms of
participatory research perhaps lies in the criticism that it is under-theorised. Therein
lies the rub. A more theoretical approach (perhaps using Third World
Feminisms or post colonial analysis as a framework) might give the methodology
academic credibility within institutions. Consequently, its strength as a
userfriendly signifier of research that de-mystifies its language and accessibility
to marginalised research participants might be compromised and challenge
the overall purpose of retaining knowledge within the community. Another
weakness of many participatory appraisals is not so much the collection or
reliability of data, but the effectiveness of subsequent action plans. Perhaps a
way forward would be to persuade funding sources to support research
programmes that allowed for more deliberative community engagement over
longer periods of time to enable communities themselves to critique, rather
than simply participate in, participatory research.</p>
      <p>Both cases also highlight that the situation to be changed is rarely
identified by the target participants. It is the external agent who stimulates the
exploration of the issue and the participants contribute to identifying the
complexity or detail of the issue or problem situation. Therefore, the extent to
which participatory appraisal is a truly grass roots led process is entirely
dependent on how flexible the researchers are prepared to be regarding research
outcomes. In the World Bank study for instance, the target issue of
HIV/AIDS was not a priority for the participant communities. It is
questionable, therefore, what sustainable outcomes would have been achieved from
the community perspectives, since funding would have been linked to an
agenda for HIV/AIDS change strategies alone. In the urban garden project
follow up action did ensue, but it was not necessarily action for change and it
was not clear whether any such action had been prioritised.</p>
      <p>An overall criticism of the quality of, and suitability of, data gathering
techniques lies, arguably, not just in the newness of those techniques but also
in the quality of facilitation training. The case studies cited above seem to
share the need for facilitation skills that derive from good adult education
practice. So participatory appraisal methodologies require a combination of
pedagogical and cultural sensitivity skills that stretch beyond those normally
required of a lone researcher who may be more practised at moving into a
research environment, collecting data and then moving back out to analyse it
independently. Whilst methods are adaptable, there is sometimes an apparent
mismatch between the researcher-facilitator’s skills and the participants’
skills and understanding. Again time and flexibility need to accommodate
these concerns.</p>
      <p>Other criticisms of PA’s credibility as a research approach must also take
into account that no research is value free. Participatory research is not
designed to produce a universal truth but it does aim to produce something
valuable for the participants. Action research is centred around engaging
people in a critique of their present situation to improve practice for the
future. Both case studies were attempting to contribute to the quality of life of
Participatory Rural Appraisal 219
poor communities. The impact on sustainable development and poverty
reduction will depend to what extent the outcomes can move us towards that
goal. In view of the fact that poverty is multi dimensional and
multidirectional (Eversole/Routh 2005) it would seem important to operationlise
the findings at several levels. As researchers we also have a responsibility to
reach as large an audience as possible. So whilst we may be furthering our
own careers in the dissemination process we can do so ethically – by using
data that draws on community voices but also presents that data in a form that
will be accepted by those wider structures in society that continue to provide
marginalising infrastructures, legislation and attitudinal barriers. At the same
time the process needs to give local people the skills, understanding and
knowledge to raise their own voices. Our ethical responsibility is in
respecting difference, being open about power differentials but trying to avoid
exploitation of these differences in a way that will undermine the very people
we are trying to help. It is the purpose (participation at all stages with a view
to local empowerment) that should be the focus, and attention to ethical
responsibilities (a commitment to methods that are appropriate for purpose, a
willingness to listen and recognise local indigenous strengths and abilities)
that will achieve new knowledge production and political will (letting go
control) that can, in turn, enable grass roots led action for change, but perhaps as
a longer term strategy than PA alone can allow.</p>
      <p>We must be realistic, however. It is highly unlikely that participatory or
any other engagement with human beings will produce consensus within any
community of different voices. Perhaps the best we can hope for is to start a
process of deepening understanding and allow the natural course of events to
slowly drip feed into an improvement in sensitivities and recognition of the
positive elements of this kind of research. The process, however, has to be
linked to wider development initiatives that can build on what PA has started.</p>
      <p>This, then, is the final justification for participatory appraisal. If
participatory methodologies provide access to data that is otherwise unavailable, then
it has a part to play in filling the gap in knowledge about disempowerment
and poverty production from the perspectives of the least empowered in
society. This holds true for all countries in the world.
