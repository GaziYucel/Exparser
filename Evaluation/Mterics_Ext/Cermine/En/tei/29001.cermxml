        In the field of educational research, the dominant discourse is squarely focused
on the practices of humans such as teachers and students (SØRENSON, 2007).
This makes a great deal of sense since education is primarily concerned with
human learning. In some cases, however, this focus on human practices may
mask the roles that materials play and furthermore limit the richness of
understanding concerning learning situations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(SHAFFER &amp; CLINTON, 2006)</xref>
        . In
mathematics education, for example, some researchers have gone as far as to
suggest that the intrinsic characteristics of educational technologies cease to
mediate learning and become increasingly transparent as learners' incorporate
them in their mathematical activities (MEIRA, 1998). Such approaches privilege
the role of humans to the point of obscuring important aspects of the meditational
role that materials have in mathematics learning and any intrinsic educational
value they might have
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11">(SHAFFER &amp; CLINTON, 2005, 2006)</xref>
        . [1]
In this paper, I focus on the role of materials in education by investigating the
inclusion of a handheld digital technology in mathematics classrooms. As a
particular technological case, I examine the development and use of the
TINspire™1 graphing calculator from Texas Instruments (see Figure 1).
Part of the latest generation of graphing calculators to be created specifically for
educational use, devices like TI-Nspire have closed the gap between what might
be considered a calculator and what might be considered a computer (DRIJVERS
&amp; WEIGAND, 2010; KAPUT &amp; SCHORR, 2008). These new technologies use
advances in mobile computer processors and displays to offer a range of
software applications such as spreadsheet tools, dynamic geometry software and
computer algebra systems (CAS) on relatively inexpensive handheld devices
(DRIJVERS &amp; WEIGAND, 2010). [3]
To investigate the role of TI-Nspire in mathematics classrooms, I draw on
educational research related to the use of educational technology in mathematics
learning but I also draw on the field of Science and Technology Studies and in
particular Actor-Network theory (CALLON, 1986; LAW, 2002; LAW &amp; MOL, 2001;
LATOUR, 2007). Specifically, I use the theoretical tools of Actor-Network theory
(ANT) to understand the relationship between humans and materials without
overtly obscuring the role that materials play and without discounting their
potential intrinsic educational value. Taking the ANT concept that the social is
comprised of networks of both humans and non-humans, I map the formation of
socio-technical networks in two mathematics classrooms where TI-Nspire from
Texas Instruments is used. [4]

        Within the mathematics education research community, several researchers
looking specifically at educational technology such as TI-Nspire have suggested
approaches to understanding the relationship between technology, teachers and
students that avoid masking its potential role

TROUCHE &amp; DRIJVERS, 2010; VERILLON &amp; RABARDEL, 1995)</xref>
        . One
particularly prominent view is known as the in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">strumental approach (LAGRANGE,
1999</xref>
        ; TROUCHE &amp; DRIJVERS, 2010; VERILLON &amp; RABARDEL, 1995). From
this perspective, learner and technology are considered to have a reciprocal
relationship and the process by which a technology becomes useful is
conceptualized as a movement from tool to instrument as the learner develops
schemata associated with the mathematical task that he/she uses the technology
to complete. Research drawing on the instrumental approach focuses on the
ways in which teachers organize the technologies available to them in the
classroom for pedagogical purposes and the ways technologies become
meaningful in the context of mathematical activity (DRIJVERS, DOORMAN,
BOON, REED &amp; GRAVEMEIJER, 2010; TROUCHE, 2004). While the
instrumental approach foregrounds the important relationship between learner
and technology, it reduces the role of the technology to that of a mere object
waiting to be made an instrument by learners. This understanding moves away
from the view that the intrinsic characteristics of a technology become transparent
as it is made useful in the context of human practice but still obscures much of
the intrinsic educational value that a material may potentially bring to an
interaction with a learner. [5]
In a bid to address the problem of obscuring the potential role and intrinsic value
of materials in investigations of mathematics learning, SHAFFER and CLINTON
(2005, 2006) have suggested another approach that draws on elements of ANT
to conceptualize the relationship between learners and materials. In particular,
SHAFFER and CLINTON (2006) take the ANT notion that when agents, whether
human or non-human, act within socio-technical networks the capacity to act is
not located in either party but instead emerges from their interaction
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(SUCHMAN,
2007; LATOUR, 2007; LAW, 2002)</xref>
        . Drawing on this notion, they assert that in
relation to computing technologies such as TI-Nspire an overt focus on the
human side of human-technology relationships may limit understanding of the
role technology plays in learning. They note that while "this may not be a problem
in a theoretic culture of static inscriptional systems. In a virtual culture based on
offloading of symbolic processing, however, using human action to analyse activity
obscures the active role tools play"
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(SHAFFER &amp; CLINTON, 2006, p.289)</xref>
        . [6]
While the use of ANT is relatively rare in educational research, Shaffer and
Clinton's approach shares a number of common features with a small group of
researchers drawing on ANT to investigate a wide range of educational topics
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref9">(ROTH, 2002; FENWICK &amp; EDWARDS, 2010; GOUGH, 2004;
SAMARAWICKREMA &amp; STACEY, 2007; SØRENSEN, 2007)</xref>
        . A key common
theme in the approaches of these researchers is a focus on the materiality of
learning situations without assuming the agency or role of any actors whether
human or non-human before examining their local interactions. SØRENSEN
(2007) for example, examined physical and virtual materials in primary school
classrooms by considering the activity between humans and materials to be a
relational effect rather than focusing on the agency of any individual or group of
actors. Her analysis describes a situation where both space and time within the
classroom are emergent phenomena of the relationships between students,
teachers and materials (SØRENSEN, 2007). [7]
Beyond conceptualizing the relationships between humans and non-humans
without making a priori assumptions about the agency of any actor, another key
common feature in studies of learning and educational settings that draw on ANT
is the combination of theoretical perspectives. Since by design ANT is more a
loose set of ideas rather than a well-defined theory, many researchers choose to
simultaneously draw on other theories to inform their work. This reflects the
evolving nature of ANT as a perspective on networks of social activity (FENWICK
&amp; EDWARDS, 2010). SAMARAWICKREMA and STACEY (2007), for example,
drew on
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">ROGERS' (2003</xref>
        ) theory of diffusion of innovations in combination with
ANT to investigate the adoption of web-based distance learning technologies by
university level instructors. Using ROGERS' theory to examine the individual
motivations and actions of the instructors and ANT to understand the networks of
humans and technology, they analyzed the cases of six Australian universities as
they adopted web-based learning technologies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(SAMARAWICKREMA &amp;
STACEY, 2007)</xref>
        . Their finding that successful adoption of technology by
instructors had little to do with general comfort with digital technology and was
instead influenced by such factors as funding grants and faculty politics illustrates
the broad range of inquiries that ANT can be implicated in through careful
combination with other theory. [8]
SAMARAWICKREMA and STACEY's (2007) choice to work with a combination of
theoretical perspectives is common amongst educational researchers who draw
on ANT (FENWICK &amp; EDWARDS, 2010). Returning to SHAFFER and
CLINTON's (2005, 2006) approach to conceptualizing the relationship between
humans and technology in learning situations, they also combine ANT with other
theory. In this case, SHAFFER and CLINTON draw on ANT together with activity
theory
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref5">(COLE, 1998; ENGESTRÖM, 2001; LEON'TEV, 1978; NARDI, 1995;
ROTH &amp; LEE, 2007; VYGOTSKY, 1986 [1934])</xref>
        . This approach addresses the
major criticism that ANT lacks tools for conceptualizing the internal properties of
agents within social networks (ENGESTRÖM, 2001). To address this limitation,
SHAFFER and CLINTON (2006) draw particularly on the activity theory notion
that all human action including cognition takes place within activity systems that
are mediated by tools, whether psychological or technical
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(LEONT'EV, 1978;
VYGOTSKY, 1986 [1934])</xref>
        . With this conceptualization, learning is considered to
be an integral aspect of all human activity that necessarily involves tools whether
or not technical tools such as educational technologies are involved

      <title>3. Theoretical Perspective</title>
      <p>
        As a theoretical perspective for this study, I follow SHAFFER and CLINTON's
(2006) approach by drawing on Actor-Network theory (ANT) in combination with
activity theory. Originating with the ideas of VYGOTSKY (1986 [1934]) and
LEONT'EV (1978), activity theory is a psychological approach that is particularly
concerned with the socially and culturally situated nature of cognition. As a
sociocultural approach to understanding cognition, it, "takes as its point of
departure the mediated nature of human knowledge and action" (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">SÄLJÖ, 1999</xref>
        ,
p.151). The theory contends that all human activity takes place within systems
that are mediated by cultural tools. These tools can be both internal or
psychological and external or technical yielding the notion that all learning
involves tools
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(SÄLJÖ et al., 2006; WERTSCH, 1991)</xref>
        . From this sociocultural
perspective, tools are understood to mediate all human activity whether we notice
them or not and are recognized as the vehicles through which we make meaning
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(WERTSCH, 1998)</xref>
        . This conception of tools, including technologies such as
TINspire, as the crucial vehicles with which we make meaning is an important part
of the way learning is conceptualized in this study as tool mediated activity. [10]
While both activity theory and ANT are concerned with the mediation of systems
of activity, activity theory refers to systems of human activity mediated by tools
whereas ANT speaks to networks of humans and non-humans all mediating each
other's activity. From an ANT perspective, the properties of technologies in
learning situations cannot be ignored or considered transparent since both they
and the humans that use them mediate each other
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(LATOUR, 2007; LAW, 2002;
SHAFFER &amp; CLINTON, 2006)</xref>
        . Instead, ANT focuses on the ways in which
sociotechnical networks form as humans and non-humans interact and their practices
stabilize (LATOUR, 2007). These networks are composed of relations of
networkobjects themselves enacted by nested networks of humans and non-humans
(LAW, 2002; LAW &amp; MOL, 2001). In the case of this study, for example, TI-Nspire
is treated as both a material object and a network-object. As a network-object it is
an element of classroom socio-technical networks that is enacted through nested
networks that include its developers, the teachers and students who use it,
electronics, software, and mathematical knowledge. Network-objects such as
TINspire become what LATOUR (1990) refers to as "immutable" as the networks
that form them become stable. While network-objects stabilize in the context of
patterns of relations, the networks themselves remain fluid (LATOUR, 1990). In
this fluid space, the relations between network-objects constantly adapt as new
elements emerge or existing elements reconfigure but throughout this fluidity,
there is by necessity continuity. Otherwise, networks cease to remain intact, "If
everything is taken apart at the same time the result is rupture, the loss of
shapecontinuity, the loss of identity. The result is more likely to be the creation of an
alternative object" (LAW, 2002, p.99). In these cases, network-objects become
new entities such as a phonebook being repurposed as a doorstop or a bolt
dissolving into the car it holds together. Drawing on ANT conceptions of
sociotechnical networks of humans and non-humans, and the activity theory
understanding of cognition as tool mediated activity, in this study I examine
classrooms using TI-Nspire. This examination is at a scale in which the
technology is viewed as a network-object while recognizing that it and other
implicated network-objects are themselves enacted through complex nested
networks. [11]

      <title>4. Method</title>
      <p>
        To develop an understanding of the ways TI-Nspire is used in classrooms, I
observed and interviewed two teachers who regularly include the technology as
part of their instructional practices. These teachers were chosen because they
are both fluent users of the technology who make extensive use of it in their
classrooms but have distinct teaching and technology use backgrounds. One
teacher is an experienced mathematics educator who has worked with graphing
calculators for more than ten years while, at the time of the study, the other
teacher was new to teaching mathematics but had a background in computer
programming and teaching technology. Choosing teachers with a high level of
technical literacy afforded me access to contexts where the technology was
embedded in many mathematics education practices but, by the same token,
such levels of technical fluency are likely not present in most classrooms and this
limits my view of the ways TI-Nspire is used. [12]
First, I conducted audio-recorded interviews using a semi-structured schedule
that focused on the teachers' use of TI-Nspire and their experiences with
technology in the classroom. I drew on the work of MISHLER (1986, 2004) and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">WEISS (1995</xref>
        ) to guide the interview process and strove for conversations that
were informal and flexible in nature. Following these initial interviews, I observed
a series of five sessions in a ninth grade class taught by each teacher. During the
five sessions in each class, I followed a complete teaching unit. In one class the
unit involved the teaching of the algebraic skills necessary to perform operations
such as simplification on binomial expressions. In the other class, the unit
focused on working with data to produce graphs and functions to model trends. I
chose to follow a complete teaching unit in each class so that I would have the
opportunity to observe both when TI-Nspire was used as well as when it wasn't. I
chose ninth grade classes because in this particular school, this was the grade
level at which students either purchased or were given a TI-Nspire handheld to
use rather than only having access to the technology during class time. This
situation offered me the interesting opportunity of observing students who were
relatively new to the technology and yet had unfettered access for developing
fluency with it. [13]
While observing the classes, I recorded the activity with a video camera from the
back corner of the classrooms. In general, I followed the teachers with the
camera since my intention for the classroom observations was to concentrate on
the ways they included TI-Nspire in their instructional practices and situated the
technology for their students. This focus on the teachers guided the majority of
the in-camera editing decisions made about where to focus recording but I also
made efforts to maintain a wide view as much as possible using panning and
zooming sparingly. As DERRY et al. suggest, while a certain amount of pan and
zoom may be needed to get a detailed view of activities of interest, "too much
selection at recording time may rule out later lines of analysis" (2010, p.48).
Drawing on this principle while concentrating my in-camera selection decisions on
the teacher, I constantly considered the balance between recording detailed
views of teacher activities such as writing on the board or interacting with an
individual student and maintaining an impression of the activity in the classroom
as a whole. Following each observed session, I invited the teachers to participate
in debriefing interviews to help unpack the events that took place and to gain
more insight into the decisions made about when and how TI-Nspire was used. [14]
Once interviews and observation had been completed, I transcribed and added
the interview recordings and the observational videos to the qualitative analysis
software package Transana that allows efficient organization and analysis of
multiple media sources
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(WOODS &amp; FASSNACHT, 2009)</xref>
        . Within Transana each
recording and transcript pair was synchronized so that sections identified in one
medium would automatically correspond with the same sections in the other
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(see
DEMPSTER &amp; WOODS, 2011 for a detailed description of a similar process)</xref>
        .
This freedom to move between recording and transcript while maintaining
synchronization afforded flexibility to the analytic process during which multiple
passes of each interview and video-recording were made. While I analyzed the
interviews and observational videos, I also examined artifacts such as digital
documents created by the teachers to load onto TI-Nspire and worksheets
collected from the observed classrooms. [15]
As an approach to the analysis of the collected multimodal data, I drew on
interaction analysis (JORDAN &amp; HENDERSON, 1995). This approach shares
many of the same or similar theoretical assumptions that are to be found in this
study. In particular, the approach assumes "that knowledge and action are
fundamentally social in origin, organization, and use, and are situated in particular
social and material ecologies" (p.41). This basic assumption is shared by both
activity theory and ANT and forms a key element of the theoretical perspective of
this study. From this underlying assumption, interaction analysis suggests a
number of ways of working with, in particular, video recordings to analyze
ethnographic data. These methods include creating content logs that outline the
activity on a recording as soon as possible having recorded an observational
session and conducting collaborative viewings with other researchers (JORDAN
&amp; HENDERSON, 1995). Drawing on these suggestions, I assembled content logs
following each interview or observed session and at least one viewing of the
recordings was made in collaboration with another researcher. [16]
Drawing on interaction analysis procedures in concert with the theoretical
perspective developed by the combination of ANT and activity theory, I examined
the interviews with teachers and students for discussion of the ways they
perceive their practices to have changed in relation to TI-Nspire. Using the
themes identified from this analysis, I then examined the classroom and
lunchtime activity session video-recordings along with collected artifacts for
patterns of relations between human and non-human agents that relate to the
use of TI-Nspire. This analysis drew on the work of several ANT researchers
concerned with the spatiality of socio-technical networks (LAW, 2002; LAW &amp;
MOL, 2001; SØRENSON, 2007). These researchers describe the socio-technical
networks that are enacted through the practices of human and non-human
agents in terms of "fluid spatiality." They suggest that the shape of
sociotechnical networks is constantly adapting and is never fixed but, importantly,
"while the connections which make a shape invariant in fluid space change
shape, they do so gradually and incrementally" (LAW &amp; MOL, 2001, p.6). Paying
attention to the continuity of network-objects within fluid socio-technical networks,
I attended to the patterns of relations in the classrooms looking specifically for
gradual formations involving TI-Nspire. I then mapped these patterns of relations
to produce a snapshot of the fluid networks as they were enacted through the
activity of the human and non-human agents in the classrooms. [17]

      <title>5. Findings</title>
      <p>From the analysis of the interviews, observational recordings and artifacts I
identified and mapped patterns of socio-technical relations involving TI-Nspire.
This mapping resulted in a geography of connections with three key areas
representing different aspects of the classroom socio-technical networks that
were identified by participants as having adapted in relation to TI-Nspire.
These areas: locations of mathematical authority, locations of mathematical
tasks, and locations of mathematical activity are illustrated in Figure 2. In the
following sections each network area will be addressed and patterns of relations
between implicated network-objects in the classrooms will be discussed. [19]</p>
      <sec id="sec-6-1">
        <title>5.1 Locations of mathematical authority</title>
        <p>
          One key area of the classroom socio-technical networks in relation to TI-Nspire
that was identified during interviews involves locations of mathematical authority
in the classrooms. Both teacher and student participants spoke about the role of
TI-Nspire as a source of mathematical guidance and way of checking answers. In
particular, teacher participants described students' asking TI-Nspire to answer
questions rather than coming to them, a phenomenon that they encouraged and
has been observed by a number of researchers in relation to other technologies
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(MONAGHAN, 2004; PIERCE, STACEY &amp; WANDER, 2010)</xref>
          . During a debriefing
session, for example, one teacher spoke about how he had encouraged students
to go to their TI-Nspire when they were stuck on a problem involving the
application of a formula to determine the volume of a solid:
"So the minute [the student] writes down the volume formula he's like 'oh is that the
right one?' Like he wants to ask me, is that the right one, am I right? And we started to
make some progress at the beginning of the year, like I said 'when solving equations
don't ask me, check [TI-Nspire], it'll tell you if its right or not'" (teacher two). [20]
This practice of suggesting to students that the technology could be a source of
mathematical help and verification was also apparent during the observed
classes. Typifying the phenomenon, in one lesson that involved a period devoted
to completing a worksheet in pairs, the other teacher participant instructed the
class to, "Work through it, talk with each other, use the handheld to check what
you're thinking to see if its giving you what you expect" (teacher one). As this
teacher often did, he reminds the class that TI-Nspire can give them definitive
answers and help them to find misconceptions in their mathematical thinking. [21]
These practices reveal new patterns of relations between teacher and students in
terms of the sources of mathematical authority in the classroom. Speaking in an
interview about the resources students have for checking their mathematical
reasoning, one teacher noted,
"They do see this [TI-Nspire] as being in the hierarchy of who you trust. Like they'll
trust the textbook, they'll trust the teacher, they'll trust the handheld right? They'll be a
little sceptical of their partners but willing to listen" (teacher one). [22]
With the introduction of a technology that can provide trusted answers to a broad
range of mathematical questions, the role of the teacher as a source of
mathematical authority changes as students can turn to the technology to resolve
mathematical problems or disagreements with others. [23]
A network-object that directly relates to the role of the teacher and TI-Nspire in
terms of locations of mathematical authority is the textbook. Similar to the way
students were encouraged to use TI-Nspire to check answers before asking their
teacher, they also tended to use the technology instead of the answer pages at
the back of their textbook. Speaking about this behavior in an interview, one of
the teachers offered, "They've realized the limitations with the textbooks, that
their answers are wrong in the back of the book. Well there's a certainty and a
trust to this [TI-Nspire]—kind of that the answers are right" (teacher one). The
teacher indicates that he has noticed his students choosing to verify answers with
TI-Nspire because it is more reliable than the back of their textbook. This practice
was observed in the classrooms with both teachers encouraging the use of the
technology to check answers by verifying each component operation used in a
solution. During one class, the same teacher described some benefits of using
TI-Nspire to verify answers telling his students:
"The back of the book lets you know if your answer is right. It doesn't necessarily
know where your thinking went wrong ok? So you're not totally lost in space if you
don't have a TI-Nspire. If you're understanding this stuff and you're confident and
you're not making silly numeric mistakes. I want you-, Each question you do check
the back of the book. I don't want you doing 15 questions all wrong and then realising
after 15 you did them all wrong ok? Those of you with TI-Nspires, you don't need the
back of the book. You check each transformational move that you make, so each
equivalence transformation, write it down, put it in your handheld and see what you
get ok? So you'll know not only if your answer is right, you'll know if each move is
appropriate" (teacher one). [24]
By offering the possibility to check each step of a solution to a problem, the
teacher asserts that TI-Nspire affords students much more information than the
correct answer at the back of a textbook can provide in isolation. It can act more
as a guide than as a simple arbiter of correct answers. Reflecting this advantage,
both teachers encouraged their students to work with the technology and their
textbook by taking questions from the book but turning to TI-Nspire for guidance
about mathematical concepts and procedures. Speaking about the benefits of
this practice during an interview, one teacher explained:
"I think the TI-Nspire allows them to play around with partial understandings much
more comfortably than the textbook. You need to fit yourself into the correct ways that
the textbook proposes you do things and some kids just can't find it in themselves to
do that. So they can still be incorrect and playing around with their ideas and trying to
resolve them with the TI-Nspire with feedback all the time. The only feedback you get
with the textbook is 'I'm wrong'" (teacher one). [25]
This teacher notes that like the back of the textbook TI-Nspire can be used to
check if an answer is correct. He asserts that unlike the back of the textbook,
however, TI-Nspire is more flexible giving students more latitude to explore
mathematical ideas. The teacher suggests that when students are working on
questions from their textbook, the technology becomes a partner in the activity.
Similar to the relationship between teacher, student and TI-Nspire in terms of
locations of mathematical authority, the socio-technical network of student,
textbook and TI-Nspire affords new possibilities for learning that would be difficult
to realize with student and textbook alone. [26]

      <sec id="sec-6-2">
        <title>5.2 Locations of mathematical tasks</title>
        <p>We have just seen how new patterns of relations were formed with TI-Nspire as a
locus of mathematical authority in the classrooms. Now we will look at the ways in
which the mathematical tasks that were assigned to students were adapted.
Speaking to such changing practices, teacher one noted that by affording
students a more flexible way to work through problems, TI-Nspire had changed
the types of questions he felt comfortable assigning. Talking specifically about
assigning homework, he suggested:
"It's changed the nature of the homework that I give because if I'm assuming a kid
has access to this [TI-Nspire] at home what I can envision them doing is very
different than if all they have is their textbook and a notebook" (teacher one). [27]
Similarly, the technology also changed the way the other teacher gave
assignments. Instead of handing out a paper worksheet or assigning questions
from the textbook, teacher two often created self-contained digital documents
that he then distributed to each student's TI-Nspire (see Figure 3).
These digital documents contained pages such as those presented in Figure 3.
Each page contained different elements of an activity such as instructions,
questions, calculation, tables, graphing, and space for recording answers. Once
students had completed all the pages of an activity, the teacher could digitally
collect their work so that he could examine it on his own TI-Nspire or using a
computer based version of the technology. During an interview, the teacher
expressed a preference for this approach over the more traditional worksheet or
questions from the textbook saying:
"I kind of actually prefer to have [digital documents] cause I can open them up. I don't
have to cart around like this stack of papers. I can just cart around the files, they're
fairly small so whether it be on the handheld or on the computer, I can just look at
what they've done" (teacher two). [29]
While here the teacher focuses on pragmatic reasons for assigning digital
documents instead of using worksheets or the textbook, during a debrief after an
observed class he spoke about how using digital documents changed his
instructional practice. Discussing a session in which students were given class
time to work with a data set that described life expectancy for males and females
based on year of birth, the teacher spoke about how he had approached the
activity before TI-Nspire:
"What I've done before is I would have given them an instruction sheet. It's a
doublesided sheet of paper. There's a graph of the men's data so they didn't actually plot the
data or use the table of values. There was the graph, it asked them to draw the line of
best fit, it asked them to make the predictions on the data. The back side was the
women's, draw the line of best fit, make the predictions in the data like the years or
whatever that I've used and then the end of that activity I actually had them do it on
[an earlier graphing calculator model], graph it and have the calculator determine the
line of best fit and then we just compared the answers. So we said ok well this is the
answer you got, the line the calculator gave us, are they close, are they different?
And then we actually from there went about talking about how to create the line and
come up with the equation using a couple of the data points" (teacher two). [30]
When assigning the activity before having access to TI-Nspire, the teacher used
to ask students to graph the male and female life expectancy data sets on paper
and then draw lines of best fit. Then he had students enter the data into older
graphing calculators that do not have all the features of TI-Nspire. With these
more basic calculators, the students then used linear regression to produce lines
of best fit. The students could then compare their drawn lines of best fit to those
produced by the calculators. Since class time was limited and the teacher's goal
was to have students explore the concept of modeling trends in data through
lines of best fit, he did not see the approach as ideal. Graphing the data on paper
took a long time but allowed students to interpret and draw their own lines of best
fit while using the older calculators for graphing took less time but did not afford
students the chance to create their own lines of best fit. TI-Nspire, however,
allows much of the manual work of data entry to be eliminated while still providing
students the opportunity to create their own graphs and lines of best fit using its
graphical functionality. By providing students with a digital document containing
all the necessary data and instructions, the teacher was able to make what he
considered to be much better use of the available class time while still focusing
the activity on the interpretation of data. Particularly by reducing the time required
for students to perform tasks, the relationship between student and TI-Nspire
opens up new instructional possibilities that allow teachers and learners to focus
on mathematical concepts. In response to these possibilities, new patterns of
relations were found in the two classrooms between such network-objects as the
textbook and TI-Nspire that showed ways that the classroom socio-technical
networks adapted in terms of locations of mathematical tasks. [31]</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-6-3">
        <title>5.3 Locations of mathematical activity</title>
        <p>While TI-Nspire may open up new instructional possibilities and ways of working,
it was not the only location of mathematical activity observed in the classrooms. It
was not even the only digital technology used. In the school that this study was
conducted, the teachers had dynamic geometry software such as The
Geometers Sketchpad™, and statistical and graphing software such as Fathom™
and Tinkerplots™ at their disposal. As is the case in many schools, however, this
software was hosted on computers in a lab that required classes to change
classrooms. By contrast, TI-Nspire is a mobile handheld device that can be used
in any classroom but has drawbacks particularly in terms of the limited size of its
screen and keyboard. These factors meant that the teacher participants had to
choose when to use TI-Nspire and when to use the computer lab. Discussing this
relationship, one teacher talked about how TI-Nspire relates to the computer lab:
"It's nice that there's a single tool that the kids can use for pretty much all the math
that we're doing right now. So if I can't get into the computer lab we can still do
Fathom or Tinkerplots things with [TI-Nspire]. Or if we can't get in the lab and use
Sketchpad there are dynamic geometry things we can do with [TI-Nspire]. So the fact
that you've always got a computer lab at the ready without having to book it, march
the kids into a different location is really nice. So that this fits itself to the lesson rather
than the lesson having to fit itself to the technology" (teacher one). [32]
Because TI-Nspire is a handheld technology it is inherently more flexible than a
fixed computer lab in terms of where and when it can be used. As the teacher
notes, it does not necessarily need to be booked and unlike computer labs which
require moving the class to another location can be used for a short part of a
lesson. During the observed classes, both teachers used TI-Nspire at times for
short periods of focused activity that might have been impractical with a computer
lab. For example, guiding the class through the simplification of a polynomial by
writing on the blackboard and describing his actions, one teacher turned to
TINspire during a discussion with two students about what the next operation
should be. The students had different views of how the expression could be
operated upon and the teacher asked them to put it in to the technology saying,
"For those of you with TI-Nspires just try putting that in and hit enter and see what
it gives you back" (teacher one). This kind of quick use of the technology would
not be practical if the class had to move to a computer lab. [33]
Beyond having the flexibility of a handheld device that can be easily transported
and used on an ad-hoc basis during a lesson, TI-Nspire was also seen by the
teachers as supporting richer mathematical conversation than traditional
computer labs. One teacher in particular indicated that part of his decision when
choosing TI-Nspire over taking his class to the computer lab was informed by the
idea that it's handheld nature lent itself to supporting or at least not hampering
conversation between students. He notes that, "The computer lab is a hideous
setup where kids are facing the wall around the outside and it's a bad setup for
learning, it's all about computers. The nice thing about [TI-Nspire] is it's not all
about the handhelds" (teacher one). Despite the perceived beneficial attributes of
TI-Nspire such as those the teacher refers to, many of its functions such as
dynamic geometry and graphing overlap with features of software often found in
school computer labs. The very size and portability of TI-Nspire that makes it
useful in some situations may render it clumsy and difficult to use in others. The
opinions and practices of the teachers show that a relationship exists between
TINspire and the computer lab. While in many cases TI-Nspire was chosen over the
computer lab, it did not totally replace it and the socio-technical networks in the
classrooms adapted to accommodate both technologies. [34]
Another digital technology in the classroom that has a relationship with TI-Nspire
in terms of locations of mathematical activity is the interactive whiteboard. It
displays a projected computer screen and allows users to interact by touching
and writing directly on the image. Teachers can project a computer software
emulator version of TI-Nspire onto an interactive whiteboard and then manipulate
a large image of the handheld (see Figure 4).
Despite this feature of interactive whiteboards that allow users to manipulate a
large projected version of TI-Nspire, in one of the observed classrooms the
teacher preferred to use a blackboard as the primary location of shared
mathematical activity. In this classroom, the blackboard was used in combination
with TI-Nspire and the translation of mathematical notation between the
technology and backboard was a key component of most of the observed
sessions. This teacher described how he had at first frequently used an
interactive whiteboard when he first introduced TI-Nspire to his classes but then
changed his practice saying,
"I used it a lot at first. I quite enjoyed using it, I use it less now. I don't like to use it as
demo because as soon as the lights go off its like it's a movie and the kids are just
like this [sits back in chair and folds arms]" (teacher one). [36]
In the other classroom, an interactive whiteboard was often used in combination
with TI-Nspire instead of the blackboard. It was the primary location of shared
mathematical activity in this classroom and was integral to the way TI-Nspire was
used. Describing his rationale for the arrangement, the teacher described, "It is
so important for them [the students] to be able to have access to it [the interactive
whiteboard] to be able to follow along. It just makes it a lot smoother" (teacher
two). By using an interactive whiteboard in combination with TI-Nspire, the
teacher demonstrated ways of working and discussed activities that in his class
were almost always assigned as self-contained digital documents. In addition,
students could and often did come up to the front of the class and share ways
they had approached problems or ways of working with TI-Nspire. For example,
during an observed session the teacher asked a student to use the interactive
whiteboard to show the class how she arrived at a solution to a problem:</p>
        <sec id="sec-6-3-1">
          <title>Teacher says:</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-6-3-2">
          <title>Student inputs:</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-6-3-3">
          <title>TI-Nspire returns:</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-6-3-4">
          <title>Teacher says:</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-6-3-5">
          <title>Student inputs:</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-6-3-6">
          <title>TI-Nspire returns:</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-6-3-7">
          <title>Teacher says:</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-6-3-8">
          <title>Go head punch it in on my calculator. As [student] punches it in I'm going to describe what she's doing.</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-6-3-9">
          <title>All right so the very first thing is just to enter the formula and again it did simplify for us because six divided by three is two.</title>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-6-3-10">
          <title>So the next step [student] did was to divide by two and she's got 50 is equal to pi times r squared. [37]</title>
          <p>
            Thus, using the TI-Nspire projected on the interactive whiteboard, the student
was able to replicate the work she had done on her handheld. This allowed the
class to discuss her approach to solving the problem without having to work with
a mediator such as a blackboard that would require them to translate between
TINspire mathematical representations and hand-written forms. [38]
A theme that runs through the patterns of relations between TI-Nspire and other
network-objects such as the blackboard and interactive whiteboard in terms of
locations of mathematical activity is the crucial connection between the
technology and paper/pencil work. The importance of this relationship is also
indicated by the large amount of mathematics education research that focuses
upon the interaction between technological and paper/pencil mathematical activity
(ARTIGUE, 2002; CHAPPEL &amp; KILLPATRICK, 2003; DRIJVERS &amp; KIERAN,
2006; KIERAN &amp; SALDANA, 2005; TALL, SMITH &amp; PIEZ, 2008). In the observed
classrooms, students worked with both paper/pencil and TI-Nspire collaboratively.
There were, however, marked differences between classes that relate directly to
the use of such network-objects as paper worksheets, textbooks, self-contained
digital documents, blackboards, and interactive whiteboards. In the class where
assignments were most often given via paper worksheets and the blackboard
was the primary medium for sharing with the group, students tended to work
predominately with paper/pencil with TI-Nspire acting as a partner in their
activities. In the class where most assignments involved self-contained digital
documents and sharing with the group took place on an interactive whiteboard,
TI-Nspire tended to be the focus of student mathematical activity. [39]
Each teacher had distinct impressions of how TI-Nspire and paper/pencil could
be useful as parts of their instructional practices. As is the case with many of the
pedagogical views teachers have, these intentions shaped the role the
technology had in their classrooms (PIERCE, BALL &amp; STACEY, 2009). During
interviews one teacher in particular spoke often about resisting the technology
becoming the focus during lessons. Discussing his choice not to find or create
digital documents and distribute them to his students, he explained:
"The documents I haven't used as much as I thought I would. And I don't think its
because there aren't documents out there that are good. It's just that I don't want it to
be about the documents, the lessons or the handheld. You know I would prefer it to
be in the background and the kids grab it when they need it" (teacher one). [40]
This teacher believed strongly that TI-Nspire should be one of many tools
available to students but that most mathematical activity should be on
paper/pencil. Sharing the view of a number of mathematics education
researchers
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref2">(DRIJVERS, 2000; PIMM, 1995; STACEY, 1997)</xref>
            , that handing-off
procedural tasks to technology may actually make conceptualizing mathematical
concepts more difficult, the teacher also expressed concern about TI-Nspire
becoming a black-box. He described his fear of TI-Nspire becoming an opaque
computational machine into which problems go and solutions come out without
any indication of the processes that have been performed. This motivated him to
de-emphasize the importance of the technology in his classroom, instead
choosing to focus mathematical activity on paper/pencil. [41]
The other teacher whose class was observed, had a distinctly different view and
spoke most often about the advantages of TI-Nspire being the primary location of
mathematical activity. Speaking during a debriefing session about a class in
which he had asked students to create a number of graphs so that they could be
compared, he offered:
"I don't think I would have got that discussion necessarily about the different points of
intersection for the male and female [datasets] today if I didn't have the technology.
Cause what would have happened is with, I don't know what did we have there 20
data points, some of the kids it would take them half an hour to graph 20 data points.
So by the time they get the one graph created and we get that line drawn that's
almost the entire period right? So you can spend a period let's say creating graphs
but now if you want to get through the graphs and just do talking about it and
analysing it and comparing it, it's so much easier to do in an instant have the graph
and now let's discuss" (teacher two) [42]
For this teacher, TI-Nspire made it possible to have more discussion and to
address more concepts than would be possible with paper/pencil. He saw these
advantages as outweighing concerns of black-box effects or the technology
becoming the focus of mathematical activity. In his classroom, the primary
location of mathematical activity was TI-Nspire with the role of paper/pencil
greatly reduced even to the point that students often took notes on the
technology. This arrangement of the technology and paper/pencil is distinctly
different to the arrangement preferred in the other teacher's class and shows
some of the range of ways that socio-technical networks form in relation to
TINspire and locations of mathematical activity. [43]

      <title>6. Discussion</title>
      <p>
        By examining the activity in classrooms where TI-Nspire is used, the findings of
this study illuminate ways that patterns of relations between teachers, students
and classroom materials adapt with the introduction of handheld technologies.
While only those adapted relations that participants expressed in their interviews
were discussed, this subset of the enormously complex set of mediators in
classrooms where handheld technologies are used shows the
interconnectedness of network-objects such as the teacher, the textbook,
worksheets, the computer lab, the board, paper/pencil, handheld technology and
students. In Figure 5, the connections between these network-objects that were
identified as having formed in relation to TI-Nspire are illustrated.
This diagram represents a snapshot of the fluid networks in the two classrooms
and the network-objects within them. It shows not only the interconnectedness of
the socio-technical networks but also the overlapping roles of the network-objects
within them. The humans and materials identified in the diagram fall within three
overlapping areas that represent the roles they play in classrooms. While an
agent such as the teacher, for example, plays a much greater role within the
classroom than just being a location of mathematical authority, this is the role
identified in terms of the networks formed in the two classrooms in relation to
TINspire. [45]
The teacher was not the only agent of the socio-technical networks in the two
observed classrooms that acted as a location of mathematical authority. The
answers at the back of the textbook, software in the computer lab and TI-Nspire
also acted as locations of mathematical authority for students to draw on. This
changed the relationship between teacher and student, allowing students to
explore their thinking further before asking the teacher for help. PIERCE et al.
(2010) also found evidence of shifts in locations of mathematical authority in
relation to the introduction of TI-Nspire. They assert that technology capable of
being a source of mathematical authority changes the didactic contract between
teacher and student and shifts socio-mathematical norms in the classroom
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(PIERCE et al., 2010)</xref>
        . While they speak to the changed relationship between
teacher and student in terms of locations of mathematical authority with the
introduction of TI-Nspire, the present study adds to this work by identifying other
important relationships within classroom socio-technical networks that are also
implicated. The textbook in particular, was identified as also acting as a location
of mathematical authority whose relationship with students shifted in relation to
TI-Nspire. [46]
While the textbook was identified as a location of mathematical authority in the
two observed classrooms, it also served as a location of mathematical tasks.
Along with paper worksheets, the blackboard and interactive whiteboard and
digital documents on TI-Nspire, the textbook acted as a way mathematical tasks
were assigned to students. Each of these network-objects afforded the teachers
different possibilities in terms of the kinds of tasks they could assign with the
network of TI-Nspire and student having distinctly different properties to student
and textbook. DRIJVERS and KIERAN (2006) have also spoken to the
relationship between technology and the kinds of tasks assigned to students.
They assert that when a student undertakes a mathematical task with a computer
algebra system there exists a dialectical relationship between that task and the
technique they use from which mathematical theorizing emerges (DRIJVERS &amp;
KIERAN, 2006; see also KIERAN &amp; SALDANA, 2005). This speaks to the
interrelated nature of materials available to students and the kinds of tasks that
can be assigned. Findings drawn from the two observed classrooms in this study
support DRIJVERS and KIERAN's assertion by suggesting the introduction of
TINspire certainly influences the kinds of tasks assigned to students but, in
addition, suggest that it influences the relationships between teacher, student and
other network elements such as paper worksheets and the blackboard and
interactive whiteboard. [47]
Apart from being implicated as a medium for assigning tasks, the blackboard and
interactive whiteboard also acted as a location of mathematical activity in the
classrooms. Together with the computer lab, paper/pencil and TI-Nspire
handhelds, the blackboard and interactive whiteboard served as locations of both
individual and shared mathematical activity. While none of these locations
replaced any of the others, they were all involved to greater or lesser extents in
the mathematical activity of each classroom. The student, teacher, board,
paper/pencil, computer software, and TI-Nspire were arranged in different ways
with each configuration supporting different activity. As several researchers have
suggested, in terms of learning perhaps what is most important is that multiple
locations of mathematical activity were available for students to work and share
with (DRIJVERS &amp; KIERAN, 2006; KIERAN &amp; SALDANA, 2005). [48]
During the course of this study, I was particularly struck by the relationship
between the activity students engage in individually and activity shared by the
whole class by means of a blackboard or interactive whiteboard. I found that the
materials that participate in this relationship have a distinct role in mediating
mathematical activity and that the interaction between students and materials in
one location had a particular influence on the other and vice versa. In the case of
this study, the materials were most often paper and pencil and TI-Nspire for
private activity, and blackboard and interactive whiteboard for public activity. The
complexity of the relationships among these materials, students and teachers as
they engaged in mathematical activity that I found in this study indicates that
more focused research with other materials and in other settings would help to
further our understanding of this important aspect of classroom practice. [49]
By taking an ANT approach that required me to attend to the interactions
between humans and non-humans in the classrooms while consciously trying to
limit a priori judgments about their roles and agency and by working with both
interviews and video-recorded observational data, the findings of this study
indicate that socio-technical networks in classrooms using handheld technology
operate as a complex interconnected whole. From interactional analysis of the
video recordings of the two classrooms, it is particularly evident that the effects of
the teachers' decisions to include TI-Nspire as part of their instructional practices
were not limited to, for instance, the local patterns of relations between student
and technology while completing an activity. These interactions are instead
extremely broad, influencing practices as diverse as homework and the use of the
computer lab. The findings of this study show as DRIJVERS et al. (2010)
suggest, that the didactical configuration of technologies in mathematics
classrooms has a profound effect on the mathematical practices within them but
also suggest that this is far from a one-way phenomenon. While teachers have
enormous influence through their choices of what technological arrangements to
use, other agents both human and non-human in the classroom mediate these
configurations and are highly interrelated. For instance, the choice to assign
activities as digital documents rather than as questions from the textbook may
influence the decision to share mathematical activity as a class with an interactive
whiteboard and may influence the decision to create digital notes rather than
work with paper/pencil. Each pattern of socio-technical relations mediates the
others and together they reciprocally shape the geography of the classroom. [50]
