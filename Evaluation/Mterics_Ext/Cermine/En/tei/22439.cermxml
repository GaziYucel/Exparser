      <abstract>
        <p>Health issues and medical science receive a lot of attention on television. Of all the sciences, the European public is most interested in medicine, and the public uses television as their main source of information on science. There has been hardly any empirical research, however, into the historical development of the representation of medical science on television. The development of medical television was explored by carrying out a content analysis of Dutch non-fiction medical television programs spanning a period of 40 years. The speaking time allotted to experts has decreased over the years, while that allotted to laypeople has increased. We are seeing fewer references to sources and science and more expression of emotion and tension. The results suggest three periods of medical television: a scientific, a journalistic and a lay period. Medical television in 2000 shows a personified picture of patients against an instrumentalized and symbolized medical backdrop.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        In some social theoretical perspectives, the development of the media is presented as the
core of the cultural transformation into the modern society
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Thompson, 1995)</xref>
        , and is closely
related to the development of science and technology. Thompson calls the development of the
media the “mediazation of culture,” by which patterns of communication and interaction have
changed in “profound and irreversible ways” (1995: 46). By now, mediazation also includes
the rise of “media logic”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref36 ref4">(Altheide and Snow, 1979, 1991; van Vree et al., 2003)</xref>
        , in which the
mass media mainly take an entertainment perspective on social and political life, and when
information is presented. The concept of mediazation was used as a background in this study
in order to examine the historical development of the representation of science on television.
Mediazation was chosen instead of mediatization because mediazation refers primary to
cultural processes and mediatization seems to become more and more defined as a concept used
to describe the penetration of mass media and their logic into other social systems, e.g.
organizations in society
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref30 ref33">(Kepplinger, 2002; Schulz, 2004; Schrott, 2005)</xref>
        . This mediatization is not
the focus of this study.
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-1-1">
        <title>Medical science and medical journalism</title>
        <p>
          In this media analysis, medicine is taken as exemplary of the development of the representation
of science on television over time. This is for several reasons. First, because of its presence
in the media, the importance the public attaches to it and the image medical science has as
being exemplary of science in general. Inhabitants of the European Union also think that
medical science is the most scientific compared to other sciences
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(European Commission, 2001)</xref>
          .
This confirms earlier research conducted in the United Kingdom
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Durant et al., 1992)</xref>
          and
Canada
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Einsiedel, 1992)</xref>
          that showed that medicine dominates the general image the public
has of science. This suggests that at least for a part of the public, medicine is paradigmatic for
science in general. The image of science in general is determined by the familiarity with and
the image of medical science. As
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">Einsiedel (1992)</xref>
          has said, a typical story about science is a
story about medical science, is based on scientific expertise and is a positive occurrence, often
a medical innovation or a treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, when measuring the attention devoted to science and technology, medical
journalism can be positioned between general news journalism and science journalism. On the
general television news, not much attention is paid to science or technology (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">León, 2004</xref>
          ). In
special science programs on television as a part of science journalism the situation is the
opposite: science and technology are very visible because the broadcasts usually are entirely devoted
to science. It can be expected that medical journalism will be positioned somewhere in between.
        </p>
        <p>The above considerations seem to make medical journalism suitable for observing
changes over time.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>2. Theoretical background</title>
      <p>
        The background to the study was the theoretical debate on and arguments concerning the
scientification and mediazation of culture and society. If we look at the development of
science we find it has determined not only the technological processes, economic systems and
social structures of society but also our everyday experience of the world and conscious
thoughts and even unconscious feelings. It is presented as the driving force behind
modernization
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Nowotny et al., 2001)</xref>
        , determining every aspect of society. Processes of
“scientification” and “socialization” have led to a science and society that are fundamentally interwoven
(cf. Ha
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">gendijk, 1996</xref>
        , 2004) and the co-production of a scientificized culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we look at the development of the mass media, we find a great deal of attention has
been devoted to the role and logic of the media and to the “mediazation of culture”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Thompson, 1995: 46)</xref>
        . This has resulted in the transformation of the public sphere, which
now takes the form more of a mediated publicness than a non-mediated agora for dialogue
and debate. Social and political life has become nothing more than a struggle for visibility in
the mass media. Mediazation has entered upon a new phase in recent decades, referred to as
“extended mediazation”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Thompson, 1995: 110–11)</xref>
        : the media have developed a “relatively
high degree of self-referentiality”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Thompson, 1995: 110)</xref>
        . Media messages refer more often
to other media messages and to events reported in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Media logic” is said to have replaced the classical journalistic way of working
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref36 ref4">(Altheide
and Snow, 1979, 1991; van Vree et al., 2003)</xref>
        . It consists of formats for the symbolic
reproduction of events; when it is applied, the form of the communication takes precedence over its
content. These formats determine how the material is organized and in what style it is
presented. They reflect underlying, often implicit rules that apply to the whole media industry,
although there are different formats for different subjects, for example for news, entertainment,
sports and talk shows. They provide the grammar for media content, they arrange actions and
events, provide temporality and produce symbols that express emotion or are meant to evoke
emotions. They are dominated by the “entertainment perspective”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Altheide and Snow, 1979)</xref>
        ,
aiming at entertaining the public instead of informing them. Information presented in an
entertainment format is sometimes referred to as “infotainment”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37 ref7">(Brants, 1998; Wieten, 2002)</xref>

        <title>News values and news factors</title>
        <p>
          Empirical research into the content of news has shown that this development towards media
logic and the self-referentiality of the media started as early as the 1950s. Much research has
shown that media content is consistent and that this content mainly can be explained by the
working of the so-called news values and news factors. Following the classical study by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Galtung and Ruge (1965)</xref>
          , many researchers have worked on extending the news value theory.
For example,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Schulz (1976</xref>
          , 1982) has shown that the content of the news and its production
are not what one would expect on the basis of the professional norms and ideals of journalists.
Important news factors are:
● Threshold: the news is about topics that exceed a certain threshold of intensity to be
noticed by journalists.
● Unambiguity: the news often presents matters as unambiguous.
● Consonance: the news is consonant with what journalists and the public have in their minds.
● Status: the news is about elite people, nations and institutes.
● Dynamics: the news presents the world as constantly changing.
● Valence: the news is about success or conflicts.
● Identification: the news often presents people who evoke compassion.
● Personification: the news is about people with whom the public can identify, people in
action and people’s emotions.

        <title>Television in the Netherlands</title>
        <p>
          The historical development of television journalism has also been described as a process
towards the increasing use of media logic. In the 1950s and 1960s, television used models
taken from the movies, followed by one derived from the press until about 1985. From then
on it started using more and more formats with the characteristics of media logic. Not only
the rise of commercial television but also technological developments are held responsible for
this

          .
        </p>
        <p>
          The Netherlands was one of the last countries in Europe to introduce commercial television
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Bakker and Scholten, 2005)</xref>
          . Until 1989, Dutch television was public television only. All
broadcasters were non-profit organizations. In 1989, commercial television was introduced parallel to
the public broadcasting system. Today, the Netherlands has three public broadcasting channels
and eight national commercial channels (Bakker and Scholten, 2005)

        <title>The mediazation hypothesis</title>
        <p>The question is how the representation of science on television has developed. Has the use of
science—medical science in this case—on television changed during the past decades, and if
so, how? Or, to put it differently, have the narratives and knowledge of journalists taken over
from those of scientists and experts in medical television programs, because of increasing
media logic? The study started out from the mediazation hypothesis, which states that the
narratives and knowledge of journalists have become more present in the media over the years
than those of scientists and experts.</p>

        <title>Medical journalism</title>
        <p>
          In order to answer the research question, a content analysis of a sample of medical documentaries
from the public broadcasting organizations in the Netherlands was carried out. It was decided
to analyze only non-fiction medical television shows, because this genre of medical television
was broadcast throughout almost the entire research period. Although fictional medical
television programs are also relevant, such programs were not broadcast in the Netherlands until
the late 1980s. Furthermore, quite a lot of research on medical drama series has already been
done
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref35 ref36">(e.g. van Dijck, 2002; Kirby, 2003)</xref>
          , in contrast to the amount on medical programs with
a predominantly informational character and aim.

      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-2">
        <title>Sample frame and sample</title>
        <p>
          It emerged from the archives of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision that from the
start of Dutch television in 1951 until 2000 over 40 different medical series were produced
and broadcast, starting in 1961. This is such a broad and varied universe that a random
sample was not suitable for the study. In order to make the historical analysis as internally valid
as possible, a sampling frame was devised. This sampling frame was made up of a group of
seven consecutive medical television series between 1961 and 2000.1 From this sampling
frame a proportionate stratified sample
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(Neuendorf, 2002)</xref>
          was drawn of two episodes per
year. The resulting sample contained 76 different episodes from 38 different years, with a
total length of 34 hours, 30 minutes and 34 seconds.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-3">
        <title>Operationalization, procedure and analysis</title>
        <p>Media content was analyzed at the level of (a) entire episodes and (b) statements, using a
constructed media reference model. This model has two dimensions.</p>
        <p>
          The first dimension—referentiality—consists of variables that measure references to
sources, references to the rules of science, the educational character of the statements and the
speaking times
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(following Adatto, 1990)</xref>
          allotted to the persons appearing in the programs. The
operationalization of the reference to rules of science is based on the Mertonian imperatives
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(Merton, 1942)</xref>
          , usually abbreviated to CUDOS,2 giving rise to such variables as reference to
communality of knowledge, reference to former knowledge, reference to universality and
causality, and reference to scientific research in statements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second dimension—news factors and media factors—consists of variables that
measure the visibility of these factors, as previously defined by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Galtung and Ruge (1965)</xref>
          and
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Schulz (1976</xref>
          , 1982). News factors can be considered the most important forms of expression
in the mediazation process. The concept of news factors gives rise to such variables as
threshold and continuity, thematization, elite persons and elite institutions, dynamics, valence (with
success on the positive side and tension on the negative side), identification, emotion,
personification, contextualization, mentioning of wider implications and presentation of events
as surprising. Also such variables as the visibility of medical clothing and accoutrements, the
discipline (humanities, hard sciences or social sciences) of the speakers in the episodes, the
storyline, the use of metaphor, speaking directly or indirectly, images presented on the screen,
mentioning of risks and moderation of the programs were part of the dimension of news and
media factors.
        </p>
        <p>In total, 31 variables were encoded. Eight variables were coded at whole-episode level,
including the speaking times allotted to various persons. This was only possible for the 1976 to
2000 period, owing to the availability of episodes; before 1976 the broadcasting organizations
did not record whole episodes, but only archived filmed reports.</p>
        <p>After coding the variables of the whole episode, each episode was divided into a
sequence of statements. A “statement” is the number of seconds during which a person talks
before he or she is interrupted. In total, 7,242 different statements were identified in programs
in the period 1961–2000. A total of 24 variables were coded at the statement level.</p>
        <p>
          All the variables and their possible values were defined and described in a code book. Four
coders encoded the data. A reliability subsample of 10 percent of the statements was drawn to
calculate Scott’s pi (π)
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Lombard et al., 2002)</xref>
          , which was calculated for the variables encoded
at statement level. The inter-coder reliability ranged from 0 to .98.
        </p>
        <p>Given the research question, the speaking times allotted to persons were aggregated
annually. Time series were produced from these aggregated data to enable patterns over the
years to be observed.3 To support the interpretation of the patterns a bivariate regression
analysis was carried out. In order to enable variables to be compared the standardized
regression coefficient (β) was reported. In addition to the bivariate regression analysis a one-way
ANOVA was conducted to explore significant differences in content in different time periods.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>4. Results</title>
      <p>Seven consecutive medical series were analyzed, those connected to three television doctors
(Dr. van Swol, Dr. Haneveld, Dr. Gisolf) in the 1960s and 1970s, and Vinger aan de pols
(“Finger on the Pulse”) in the period 1981–2000. Vinger was the dominant medical program
in the Netherlands at the time. It was anchored by medical journalist Ria Bremer, first in
cooperation with television doctor Dr. Lens and later (after 1987) alone.</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Speaking time</title>
        <p>An important indicator of the way medical science is represented on television is the speaking
time allotted to the various participants in the programs. Non-fiction medical television programs
show more than seventeen different groups of participants, falling into three categories: experts,
journalists and laypersons.</p>
        <p>In order to distinguish between different kinds of experts and the different roles experts
can play, the participants in the category experts were encoded into three different
subcategories: pure scientists, other experts (medical and otherwise) and medical doctors. The total
speaking time of all these experts together decreased over time. Medical doctors, in different
roles, have by far the largest share of the speaking time of experts, followed by pure scientists.</p>
        <p>The second category—journalists—also plays various roles in the programs, for example as
moderators or as on-location reporters or commentators. In the third category are laypersons,
such as patients and their families and representatives of patient groups and of the general public.</p>
        <p>Figure 1 shows the speaking times observed in the three categories (i.e. experts, journalists
and laypeople) between 1976 and 2000. From 1976 to 2000 relative speaking times among the
three categories changed greatly. The speaking time allotted to experts decreased significantly
over this period (β = –.373, p &lt; .10) and that allotted to laypersons increased (β = .357, p &lt; .10).
The speaking time allotted to journalists did not change significantly from 1976 to 2000 (β =
.267, not significant). The pattern of the changes enables three periods to be identified. The first
was from 1976 to 1980, when experts had the most speaking time (54.7 percent). Television
doctors (in the roles of anchorman and doctor) moderated the programs and invited medical
specialists and patients and other laypeople (38.9 percent of speaking time) to speak. Journalists
(6.4 percent of speaking time) performed a supporting role as on-location reporters and
occasionally as commentators. Between 1981 and 1987 the pattern changed, with a markedly
increased role for journalists. In spite of visible cooperation with television doctors, journalists
acquired a larger share of speaking time (36.6 percent). Experts had a smaller share of speaking
time (31.3 percent) and from 1981 onwards the broadcasts no longer featured experts in the role
of scientists. Visible cooperation between television doctors and journalists ceased by 1987,
when doctors stopped playing an anchor role: from then on this was performed only by
journalists. This period marks the beginning of a new era of speaking time distribution, which
stabilized further in the third period, from 1988 to 2000: speaking time allotted to experts
decreased even more (21.9 percent) in favor of laypeople (46.1 percent).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>Content of the episodes</title>
        <p>At episode level, we identified some significant changes in the content of medical television, as
shown in Figure 2. The presentation of topics in an impersonal context decreased (β = –.595,
p &lt; .001): after 1988, 80 percent of the topics in medical programs were discussed in a personal
context. Stories were more often personified in the form of specific laypersons, patients and
their families, and less often in generalized stereotypes with which the public could identify.
This is underlined by the decrease in the number of children in the programs as an identifier for
the public (β = –.438, p &lt; .05). Also, topics were less often discussed in a general way, leaving
aside the major or minor implications for certain people: not mentioning implications decreased
significantly (β = –.697, p &lt; .001). This coincided with a decreasing proportion of
non-thematized episodes (β = –.737, p &lt; .001). Gradually more attention was devoted to familiar subjects
and persons, with increasing thematization (β = .367, p &lt; .10).</p>
        <p>The threshold for gaining attention with medical television programs has increased for
basic health problems (everyday topics): interest in these problems has decreased significantly
(β = –.595, p &lt; .001) over time.</p>
        <p>Many of the subjects dealt with in the programs that were produced in the 1960s/1970s
are basic health problems: most attention is paid to such matters as pregnancy and childbirth,
followed by dental care, accidents involving children, illness and holidays, allergies, venereal
diseases, puberty and so on. Besides these basic health problems, attention is also paid to
cancer and to heart and vascular diseases.</p>

          <p>The 1980s gave rise to a dichotomy between attention to basic health problems and
increasing attention to such matters as cancer, heart and vascular diseases and organ transplants—
areas in which first-class clinical care and technological solutions play an important role. The
majority of the post-1988 programs are about diseases that need first-class clinical care or
new and specialized treatments, such as cancer, heart diseases, AIDS, Huntington’s disease

time, as can be seen from the differences in the three periods of speaking time identified.4
Until 1988, the statements analyzed included explicit verbal references to sources and
science, operationalized as mentioning sources and speaking about the results or the
backgrounds of scientific research, mentioning the validity and the foundation of the claims made
in the statement, and referring to previous confirmed knowledge about the subject spoken
about in the statement. After 1988 this was far less the case: reference to sources decreased
significantly (β = –.055, p &lt; .001) over the whole period, as did verbal references to science
(β = –.097, p &lt; .001, shown in Figure 3).5</p>
        <p>There was also a decrease in the number of statements explaining medical problems or
illnesses (β = –.039, p &lt; .001). The number of educational statements was highest from 1970
to 1990; the content of educational statements also changed after 1988, away from the
prevention and explanation of illnesses towards mainly explaining medical treatments. In addition,
the manner in which explanations were given changed, from medical lectures on television in</p>

the 1960s and 1970s to seminars with public participation in the 1980s; after 1988 the focus
was on stories about personal experiences of patients and their families, with explanations
generally kept implicit. This coincided with an increasing number of statements in medical
programs where experts spoke indirectly, that is, not addressing the public or the journalist
directly but being shown talking to patients and families in the consultation room or during
surgery in the operating theatre.</p>
        <p>Also the number of unambiguous statements increased significantly after 1988. Although
there has never been much ambiguity in medical television programs, it has further diminished
since 1988.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, medical experts were presented as merely tools for the treatment of patients
or symbols of the medical or scientific field. After 1988 experts were more often shown
wearing medical clothing (β = .102, p &lt; .001) and with other medical accoutrements on screen
(β = .108, p &lt; .001). The tension and emotion in the programs mounted over time. The
proportion of statements articulating conflicts and disagreements increased significantly (β =
.031, p &lt; .01), especially after 1981, as did the proportion of statements expressing emotions
(β = .031, p &lt; .01). Lastly, there was an increasing sense of instability and drama in the
programs: patients’ conditions were increasingly presented as rapidly changing, as can be
seen from the growing proportion of statements articulating some kind of unpredictable
change (β = .112, p &lt; .001).</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions and discussion</title>
      <p>The study shows that the way medical science is represented and used in the Dutch media
changed from 1961 to 2000. There has been an unmistakable tendency towards mediazation.
The change seems to be more complex than the mediazation hypothesis suggests, however: it
is not a matter of science simply being replaced by journalism. The historical trend shows that
the roles of the various participants in the programs have changed, starting with a change
in the distribution of the available speaking time, which shows what, on the basis of the
mediazation hypothesis, is an unexpected development in the role and position of laypeople.
The speaking time of laypeople has increased significantly and the speaking time of experts
has decreased significantly.</p>
      <p>Three different periods were identified on the basis of the observations. The first, from
1976 to 1980, could be called the “scientific period,” as the speaking time ratio favors experts.
The content analysis of statements indicates that this scientific era started earlier, in 1961. In
the second period, from 1981 to 1987, journalists took over the anchor role in medical
programs, hence it could be labeled the “journalistic period.” This marks the beginning of a
new distribution in which the speaking time allotted to experts decreased in favor of
laypeople. This new distribution intensified and stabilized in the third period, from 1988 to 2000,
which could be termed the “lay period.”</p>
      <p>
        In the 1980s, journalists started to take the lead in and to give direction to medical television
programs. Why this change took place cannot be derived from the content of the programs.
On the basis of the content of the programs, it seems that the “factuality regime” in the
programs has changed from a medical science one via a journalistic one to a lay one. A
factuality re
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">gime is defined by Hagendijk (1996</xref>
        : 186) as a “collection of assumptions, goals,
impressions and rules which play a role in the production and evaluation of factual claims.”
      </p>
      <p>These journalistic and lay factuality regimes increasingly mask science rules in favor of
an instrumentalized and symbolized image of experts, generally painting a picture of medical
science as a mere tool. To put it another way, science has become technology, more or less
simplistically presented as a scenic backdrop to the lives of laypeople. This observation
matches the way news factors function: several of these converged, especially after 1988, in
the direction of personifying laypeople. The speaking layperson is more often a recognizable
person with a personal tale that is followed over a lengthy period of time. This trend is in line
with the “layification” of speaking time in the programs.</p>
      <p>
        This layification of the speaking time might be explained by the transformation in the
patient–doctor relationship that occurred between 1961 and 2000, and the rise of patient
activist groups and activism around specific diseases like AIDS
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Epstein, 1996)</xref>
        or
controversies about treatments
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Kent, 2003)</xref>
        or medicine
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Andsager and Smiley, 1998)</xref>
        . Those
contextual developments cannot be derived from this content analysis, although an increase in
speaking time for patient groups or representatives of activists was not found in this study.
      </p>
      <p>A number of other news factors, however, have developed in a way that diverges from the
personification of laypeople: for instance, less attention is devoted to everyday medical
problems, and after 1988 the television stories of laypeople were increasingly characterized by
change, emotions and conflicts. This indicates that a journalistic regime was also present in
the lay period, which constructs a narrative of personified laypeople, told in terms of news
factors: dynamics, valence, unambiguity and emotion.</p>
      <p>This feature of media content in the lay period illustrates what we might call the paradox
of the layification of medical television: the lives of laypeople are not actually at issue, nor is
their everyday knowledge and context, which—in the journalistic factuality regime—are of
importance only as long as they are compatible with the news factors. This also results in
experts playing a supporting role in the journalistic tale as tools and symbols of the medical
science world.</p>
      <p>
        The study shows the historical development of the content of medical television
programs in the direction of infotainment
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Brants, 1998)</xref>
        and entertainment. References to
science have not completely disappeared, but they are more implicit and symbolical. This
trend could be the result of the introduction of commercial television in the Netherlands, which
began in 1989. The Dutch public broadcasting organizations may have anticipated this by
changing the content of the programs more in the direction of infotainment and entertainment.
This anticipation of the rise of commercial television corresponds theoretically with the
historical development of television journalism, described as a process towards increasing use of
media logic
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref38">(Wijfjes, 2002; Altheide and Snow, 1979)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Medical journalism on television in 2000 paints a personified and instrumentalized
picture of the scientificized society, without problematizing or explaining science explicitly. The
scientification aspects and construction processes of medical science are increasingly
expressed only implicitly or ignored.</p>
      <p>The observed development of medical television towards infotainment and entertainment
shows a picture of a taken for granted, almost consumerist use of medical experts, medical
scientists and medical scientific knowledge. Such a one-dimensional media image of science
and health care as an instrument does not do justice to the complex interrelation of science
and society. Finally, in terms of social effects the question can be raised about the effect that
this way of presenting medicine and health care on television has had and still has on the
public. This is a question for further research.</p>

3 The time series in Figures 1, 2 and 3 were done using a T4253H smoothing filter in order to enable trends to be
recognized and for reasons of presentation. The smoothing technique levels off fluctuations but leaves the original
time series trend unchanged.
