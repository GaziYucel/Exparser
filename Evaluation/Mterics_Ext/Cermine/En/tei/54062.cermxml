      <p>The woman’s life…
A vida da mulher após a mastectomia à luz da teoria adaptativa de Roy</p>
      <p>The woman’s life after mastectomy in the light of Roy Adaptive theory
La vida de las mujeres después de la mastectomía teniendo en cuenta la teoría de adaptación de Roy</p>
      <p>n modern societies, with technological advances, one can notice an increase in
survival of the population, where currently the life expectancy is increasing. It is known that
the exponential increase in survival is advent of advances over the years, the scientific and
technological methods in the intervention of the binomial health and disease.</p>
      <p>Technological advances have also provided the surgical interventions, which has been
one of the alternatives for curing various diseases. The present study addressed the
adaptation of women in daily activities after undergoing mastectomy, correlating it with the
adaptive theory of Roy and the assistance provided by nursing professionals to these clients.</p>
      <p>The Mastectomy is the surgical name that is given to removal of the breasts. This
procedure can be simple with only the removal of the breast tissue, breast quadrantectomy
parts of, or all, which is removed beyond the breast tissue, muscles, and regional lymph
nodes. Early detection of breast cancer makes possible an intervention with higher cure odds
and a better prognosis of doença.¹</p>
      <p>The cancer epidemiology reveals that this is the second most common type in the
world, and the most common among women, accounting for 22% of new cases each year. If
diagnosed and treated in time, the prognosis is relatively good. In Brazil, breast cancer
mortality rates remain high, most likely because the disease is still diagnosed in advanced
stages. In the world population, the median survival after five years is 61%. Relatively rare
before age 35, above this age its incidence is growing fast and steadily. Statistics indicate an
increase in its incidence in developed countries and in developing countries. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), in the 60s and 70s there was an 10-fold increase in
incidence rates adjusted for age in the population-based cancer registries of several
continents.¹</p>
      <p>Breast cancer may be associated with physical carcinogens, chemical, biological or
hereditary; you know, therefore, the importance of mammograms for early detection of
breast cancer, where after diagnosis confirmed by biopsy the patient goes to undergo a
chemotherapeutic process, but currently the only treatment that aims to cure cancer is
surgical. When the cancer is identified to a woman with breast cancer experiences
psychological conflicts and emotional disturbances even before the chemotherapy, and when
it receives the news of the mastectomy impact on your life is very great because the breasts
are a visa agency for many companies as symbol of femininity, this woman can experience a
great inherent conflict due to own cultural factors which this is inserida.¹</p>
      <p>The Sister Callista Roy adaptation model has been one of the most widely studied.
Began in the late 60 when Roy was a graduate course student at the University of California,
Los Angeles. His works were influenced by his training in social sciences and reflect an
individual posture while person.2 In his theory the first area of concern is the identity of those
who receive nursing care, may be a person, a group, a community or society. The idea of an
adaptation system combines the concepts of adaptation and Sistema.3</p>
      <p>Roy describes the person as an adaptive system with inherent fighting mechanisms and
acquired that allows you to compete with the internal and external changes that occur to
him. Classifies such mechanisms as regulators or innate, those whose response is automatic
and resulting from neural activities, chemical and endocrine mechanisms and recognizers or
acquired, those whose answer is given by cognitive / emotional channels, is behavior resulting
from learning experiência.²</p>
      <p>The humanistic values of the Roy Adaptation Model are its definition of the purpose or
specific nursing goal. Human existence is seen as dynamic and intencional³. The person is
respected as creative and active in using their nursing process and as an active participant in
your care. The purpose of nursing to adapt contributes to the health of the individual and the
unity and solidarity of the person, within its self in relation to others.4</p>
      <p>A longer description of the internal processes of the person as an adaptive system, Roy
sets the effectors systems. The four modes are effectors or adaptive physiological function,
self-concept, role function and interdependence. The behavior related to the ways is the
manifestation of adaptive level of the person, and reflects the use of coping mechanisms.
Through observation of the person's behavior with regard to adaptive modes, the nurse can
identify adaptive or inefficient responses in health situations and doença.³</p>
      <p>The work was based on adaptive theory of Roy, in which the author describes that
human beings can adapt to different situations, stimuli and environments, that is, had the
object of investigation the process of adaptation in women with mastectomies correlating it
to Roy's adaptation theory, and the assistance provided by the nursing professional in the pre,
during and after surgery.</p>
      <p>Thus, for better depth in this study the following objectives were outlined: verify the
methods of adaptation of women with mastectomies and correlate the adaptive process
exposed the woman to the theory by Roy; raise the presence of changes in a woman's life
habits after mastectomy; determine the care provided by nurses to women with
mastectomies.</p>
      <p>Research conducted through qualitative approach descriptive, addressing the study of
essences and descriptions of the experiences of patients who experienced the process of
adaptation.</p>
      <p>Study subjects were four women with mastectomies, against the backdrop of the south
Fluminense region in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The collection and analysis of data through
interviews conducted by analytical categorical analysis.</p>
      <p>This study complied with the ethical aspects of research provisions in the resolution
466/2012 of the National Council on Health, it is the research regulation in humans. The free
and informed consent was provided to all those involved in the search for signature.</p>
      <p>The project was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee of the Centro
Universitário de Barra Mansa where he was subjected to the CEP on 06/06/2011, entitled "The
Women's World after Mastectomy in light of Roy Adaptive Theory" under the approval CAAE
number - 0036.0.340.000-11.</p>
      <p>The analysis of questionnaires was held in South region, located within the Rio de
Janeiro, in four women with mastectomies, with the overall objective to know the lives of
women after mastectomy correlating it with the adaptive theory of Roy and describe the care
provided by nursing professionals.</p>
      <p>The breast carcinoma presents as a complex and heterogeneous disease of unknown
etiology, high incidence rate and mortality and few signs and symptoms. Simply put, one can
conceptualize this pathology as a malignant tumor, caused by an excessive multiplication of
cells that invade healthy cells your volta.5</p>
      <p>As for the socio-demographic profile of the subjects was detected which is configured
as follows:</p>
      <p>Sex: 100% Female.</p>
      <p>Age: 100% are concentrated in the age 45-65 years
Woman 01 = 46 years
Women 02 = 50 years</p>
      <p>Women 02 = 61 years
Women 04 = 60 years
Education: 25% High School Incomplete, 25% First Degree Incomplete, 25% and 25%
Magisterium not have training.</p>
      <p>Occupation: They have 50% occupancy and 50% have no occupation.</p>
      <p>Marital Status: Unmarried 25%, 25% Married 25% Wives and Widows 25%.</p>
      <p>Through the survey it was found that the findings broken down by percentage were
dissimilar. Thus, our research has all civil states existing in Brazil (single, married, divorced
and widowed), has uniformity among women with 50% occupancy for those without
occupation 50% and also has different levels of educational background.</p>
      <p>After verification of the socio-demographic profile, began the preparation of the
analytical categories.</p>
      <p>Given the primary objective of the study, this emerged from the question that sought
to reveal what the reactions that the woman presented from the diagnosis of cancer, the
following results were found:</p>
      <p>There are differences between the interviewees' discourse, where the meaning of
cancer for women can be directly associated with death, due to the nature of the problem;
may feel sad wanting to cry and be alone or have a quiet and / or impartial reaction.</p>
      <p>Noted in the account of deponents who was at diagnosis fear of the impact that
represents the disease in their lives and misunderstanding of the meaning of the disease, as
well as detect reactions unbiased view of the diagnosis of the disease. We also observed the
first adaptive reactions, where this first moment (moment diagnosis of breast cancer) the
report of the women 01, 02 and 03 showed negative reactions; Roy classifies "negative
response to the stimulus," the woman 04 showed a reaction of tranquility "positive response
to the stimulus."</p>
      <p>"Facing the diagnosis of breast cancer, the woman experiences feelings of fear,
sadness and denial" 6 In the urgency of view as having a disease that threatens life, which
causes him uncertainty about what will happen with you and future , the person starts to
interact with death. Interactions with death also occur in the form of direct association
between having cancer and being condemned to die.7</p>
      <p>The cancer has stigmatizing character, is seen as synonymous with death and causes
painful transformations in the life of mulher.8 internal and external changes, that is, input
stimuli, are in contact with the person's coping state, where the level of the person adaptation
will determine whether or not elicited a positive response to internal stimuli and externos.³</p>
      <p>The fact that it is found, at a certain time, with cancer, stage which means a
movement that begins with taking knowledge that has this disease, since there are early
indications that clarification and the decision of what to do from that momento.7</p>
      <p>So it should be noted that, at the time a person is diagnosed with cancer, she needs
time to think, time to organize ideas, so that it can find a better solution for dealing with
problems. "The interaction with these means may be decisive for the attribution of meaning
and the definition of the situation, orientation to action taken by the person7.The study of
the following statements is exemplified:</p>
      <p>"The record cost to fall, I was standing looking at the doctor's face, no reaction, then
I started to cry, only after two years that I began to understand better." Woman 01
"She wanted to be alone, away from it all, not as depression, but with the feeling of
being in line to death." 02 Women</p>
      <p>"It was the worst possible reactions, because I thought I could die even though the
chances of a cure." Woman 03</p>
      <p>"There are about twenty years ago, I noticed a lump to palpate my breast so I went
to see a doctor, this referred me immediately to be biopsy, then came the diagnosis of
cancer, it happened so fast, I did not feel any pain, I was very quiet, only stopped to think
and reason about my life, that's all, people around me were more concerned with the disease
than me. I mastectomies and I was fine, at least for another eighteen years. Two years ago
I began to feel a lot of back pain, I again call the doctor, then came the diagnosis of
recurrence, and now the cancer is not only within, it has spread to the bones and it was, I
was quiet too, I think everything that happens has a purpose, but this time is different feel
much pain, cancer will not let me forget he's there. But I'm not sad, I feel good, sometimes
I thought I had to pretend to be sad to please the people who were around me, I am a quiet
person and I ask the same to my family, they are also quiet. The only time I was really upset
was the day I took the prescription to kill the car tax, which was written - patient in
palliative care - I think that day, the first time skin, I had real confidence in knowing that it
will not end up in a month or two, but something bigger, longer" Woman 04</p>
      <p>Given the second objective of the study was to identify the date that had been held
mastectomy, the study reached the following result: The age groups with the highest
incidence of cancer among the women interviewed comprise between 40 to 50 years, and
confirmed the need for clinical breast examination after age 40, which is understood as part
of comprehensive care to women's health. The deponent 04, reports recurrence of the disease
with bone metastasis, thus we highlight the importance of performing diagnostic tests at
intervals for those who have experienced the disease and out mastectomizado due to disease
relapse possibilities.</p>
      <p>Mastectomy is a procedure used to prevent the spread of cancer mama.9 So from these
data it is understood that soon diagnosed cancer, according to its staging, the surgical
procedure was performed. These data enable the identification of the age groups with the
highest incidence of breast cancer, thus serving as a subsidy to develop prevention strategies
through tracking.</p>
      <p>The recommendations and guidelines for the diagnosis of palpable breast lesions for
women under 35 years of age and ultrasonography (USG) for women aged 35 or older,
mammography is the method recomendado.10</p>
      <p>The second category analyzed emerged of the following statements:
"Eighteen of October two thousand and seven, of course I remember that day." Woman
"Twenty-seven January two thousand, a date I will never forget me." Woman 02
"It was in 2006." woman 03
"In June 1992, I am again with cancer, but will not be mastectomies because this has
spread to the bones, just do chemotherapy and take medications for back pain." Woman 04</p>
      <p>In view of the third objective of the study that sought to identify what was the reaction
that the woman appeared before the need for mastectomy, revealed as a result:</p>
      <p>It was noticed that the reports of respondents there were differences at diagnosis
(time of challenge), and 50% had acceptance reactions (positive feedback); 25% did not
believe at first, skepticism about the diagnosis (negative responses) and 25% had mixed
reactions of refreshment and pain before the procedure (neutral). Parameters being used
with the time of diagnosis of mastectomy as (time stimulus) the word "accept" as a (positive
reaction), the words "not accept" as (negative reactions) and other responses were classified
as neutral. These results were found using the following endpoint:</p>
      <p>Time of diagnosis of mastectomy = time stimulus
Rejection = negative reactions;
Acceptance = positive reactions;
Other responses = neutral.</p>
      <p>The reaction to the possibility of being with cancer can also be expressed by a not
believe, looking itself for evidence that depart from the idea that is in danger and that return,
at least temporarily, the lost tranquility "to not believe this is really happening "as well as
the positive reactions" will be released as soon as possible than to disturb "7 The attitude of
thinking is an internal brainstorming exercise where they can be convinced" to accept the
conditions and possibilities of the form of treatment chosen, pondering the urgent need to
treat in order to prevent the spread of the disease and the need to undergo more invasive
and / or radicais.7</p>
      <p>Therefore the activity of thinking (brainstorming exercise) can help women to accept
the proposed therapy. The professional of health, can act indirectly, explaining all procedures
to be performed, showing the possible surgical benefits. Reinforcing this argument, the
statements were extracted:
"I accepted" woman 01
"I did not believe at first, wanted to look for other solutions, each query expect a
different answer." Woman 02</p>
      <p>"It was very fast the time has come between the diagnosis and the diagnosis of
mastectomy, I accepted, I was quiet, the doctor on the day of my surgery told me something
in my memory - I'm just an instrument where that only through God and his power that we
will win this obstacle." Women 04</p>
      <p>Also according to the same purpose search reached a second result: The woman before
mastectomy diagnosis may be uncertain reactions because the surgery is the possibility of
cure while the mutilation of a body part of a feminine characteristic.</p>
      <p>Roy's theory "allows us to recognize people by stimuli can trigger responses, sometimes
positive and negative in others, in stressful situations.11" Given the evidence of neutral
responses, we disagree with the theory proposed by Roy, appearing then the question before
the report "Mixing and pain relief" woman 03. How to measure this reaction was adaptive or
ineffective? Thus one can conclude that neutral responses when generating conflict between
something that may be good and bad at the same time, and do not generate replies, or
positive or negative even for a short period of time, occurring after a hit, negative.
Reinforcing the above analysis it follows the statement:</p>
      <p>"It was a mixture of relief and pain. On the one hand there was the possibility of
ending this disease and the other had the pain of losing a part of my body that would take
me all the feminine vanity." Woman 03</p>
      <p>Given the fourth objective of the study was to identify the presence of any limitations
in daily life of these women, the study behind as a result: The main problems presented by
the deponents were related to shoulder movements; the impossibility of use of accessories,
low-cut clothes and change in daily routine.</p>
      <p>“It was noticed in the account of deponents that 75% of women have a physical
disability, 25% reported psychological limitation, "is very difficult to accept the loss of a part
in my body, even after all this time I had the surgery" woman 03. Complementing the subject
the article published by the Brazilian Journal of Nursing "This shame image is exacerbated,
particularly for the mutilation of a body part, one of the main symbols of female identity.8"</p>
      <p>After excision or mastectomy radiation and the adjacent axillary lymph nodes, the
patient may develop shoulder mobility limitations, particularly in the shoulder flexion and
abduction and adduction movements and combined extensão.12</p>
      <p>The causes of limitation of shoulder joint range may be different: Source limitation
really articulate, limitation due to muscle stiffness, lastly painful limitation in the individual
limits movement aiming the joint reaches the range that triggers the sensations
nociceptivas.13</p>
      <p>There may be pain and muscle spasm in the neck and shoulder as a result of reflex
muscle protection. The levator muscle of the scapula, teres major and minor and
infraspinouts are usually tender to palpation and may restrict the mobility of active ombro.4</p>
      <p>The reduction in the use of the upper limb after surgery involved predisposes the
patient to the development of chronic frozen shoulder and increases the likelihood of lymph
edema in hand and braço.9</p>
      <p>The upper limb lymph edema is a frequent consequence in breast surgery plus
axillary’s dissection. One third of patients treated for breast tumors develop lymph edema,
the severity of which varies and may be mild or very severe, leading to functional constraints,
aesthetic problems, and even profissionais.13</p>
      <p>Lymph edema develops from an imbalance between demand and capacity lymphatic
system draining lymph. The proteins of high molecular weight are outside into the
interstitium. Increasing the concentration of protein in the vascular means generates changes
in osmotic pressure, and results in the ultimate presence in the interstitial fluid that is the
linfedema.13</p>
      <p>It is noticed that all the women interviewed reported some difficulties to deal with
the limitations imposed by breast surgery, the respondents experience the difficulties of
adapting to a new reality, thus complementing the matter Roy describes the person as "an
adaptive system with mechanisms confrontations innate and acquired which allow you to
compete with the internal and external changes that rushes you.2”</p>
      <p>We tried to in the following lines, portray the results found:
"I brought, I cannot make efforts repeatedly, cannot walk fast, I cannot wear bracelets
on her arm, I cannot sunbathe, feel shoulder pain and cannot catch weight." Woman 01
"I brought, I cannot use low-cut blouses, there were changes in the clothes" Woman</p>
      <p>"I did not bring me any physical limitation, but the psychological persists because it
is very difficult to accept the loss of a part in my body, even after all this time I had the
surgery" woman 03</p>
      <p>"Yes, mastectomy withdrew all my direct mama, I did not put prosthesis at the time
more or less saw years ago I saw no need for such a thing, and I see today, but there are
certain environments that I feel uncomfortable, go to the beach, for example. Today with
the recurrence of the disease, where it was also for bones, many feel back pain, repetitive
strain cannot do, I had to stop activities carried out before, such as weight lifting, swimming,
water aerobics; riding a motorcycle. I had to change my routine." Women 04</p>
      <p>Given the fifth objective of the study, which aimed to identify if there was change in
the lives of these women after mastectomy, the result was: The category analyzed identified
that 75% of women showed no change in life after mastectomy, 25% reported change in
routine, but still does not characterize this change as bad. Illustrating the above arguments,
the following statements:
"No, improved until today I am even happier, was a lesson for my life." Woman 01
"He had in everyday life, only in the head." Woman 02
"There were no changes in my daily life." Woman 03
"Yes, and recurrence of the disease cannot do the same things as before, with that, I
changed my routine before practiced many physical exercises, today I cannot due to the
intense back pain, I try to take my time going to the movies, talking with friends, watching
television, reading good books, traveling. I do not feel upset about this; I'm just living longer,
doing things that previously did not. Also go to a psychologist who helps me a lot." Woman
04</p>
      <p>Given the sixth goal of the study, which emerged from the need to evaluate the care
provided by nursing professionals’ pre, during and after surgery, the study reached the
following results: Unprepared of the nursing care professional to act following a surgical
mastectomy process.</p>
      <p>There were differences in the assessment of care provided by nursing professionals;
case reports that characterized the action of these as positive 50%, neglect of case reports
25% and 25% professional attitude change over the years. Thus, the research reveals that
there are still unprepared care of nursing professionals to work following a surgical
mastectomy process. The statements below, exemplifies the result:</p>
      <p>"I felt a part of the unprepared of nursing in the hospital that had the surgery because
it seems that they were not trained for this type of surgery, I was not prepared for a hospital,
nursing group was not aware of my state, but where I did radiotherapy and chemotherapy I
felt a lot better staff training. "Woman 01
"I have nothing to complain about, very good, quiet by all.” Women 02
"The assistance of nursing professionals was great, away from my family because they
have helped me in the postoperative period in the INCA (Cancer Hospital of Rio de Janeiro."
Woman 03</p>
      <p>“Twenty years ago when I made the mastectomy, I thought it lacked attention of
nursing professionals, lacked a nursing to look at the person not only as a disease but with a
patient, the nurse does not know how important a handshake, a conversation. When I
searched the hospital again due to the intense back pain and discover the recurrence of the
disease, I found that nursing has improved, is closer to the human side.” Women 04</p>
      <p>Given the seventh goal of the study aimed to understand the feeling of women today
(simultaneously) after mastectomy, bringing as a result: Adaptation is continuous</p>
      <p>The reports of the interviewees reveal that the accordance after the cancer is
possible, 50% of them report that the end of treatment was more acceptable, 25% reported a
reduction in self-esteem, but are trying to adapt to the new reality and 25% even in care
palliative show up well. We agree with Roy at this point, where it describes that "the constant
interaction of people with their environment is characterized by internal and external
changes. In this changing world people need to maintain its own integrity; that is, each person
continuously adapts4”. For better understanding we extract the following statements:
"I learned a lot with cancer, I had a lesson in my life, I now accepted all better
understand each other better." Woman 01
"Well, I never had problems, today it's all normal.” Women 02
"Despite the reduction in my self-esteem’s trying to ma adapt to this new reality and
I thank God for giving me the chance to survive this disease." Woman 03</p>
      <p>"It may seem to undermost on my part, but I feel good, I try to live my quiet life,
enjoying every moment, without worrying too much about tomorrow." Woman 04</p>
      <p>Finally the study showed that it is essential that women stop and make an inner
reflection exercise in diagnostic moments, and then find the best choices. As for the
correlation with Roy theory there were times when we differ than she proposes, and there
were times that we agree with the proposed theory. The professional nursing in preoperative
care is of vital importance at the time of breast surgery the woman is involved in multiple
thoughts, which can be positive or negative, and then the nurse should calm her, explain the
procedures to be performed and pay attention- for expected problems.</p>
      <p>It is appropriate to note that in this study, it was very clear evidence of adaptive
reactions. In the first analysis of categories can be observed negative reactions, which are
directly related to the diagnosis of cancer, where evidence of a disease that threatens the
lives leads many women to react negatively, in which Roy classifies as a "negative response
to the stimulus." Cancer in women's view is a disease that is directly associated with death,
become so frightening stage for these.</p>
      <p>We found disease recurrence reports with bone metastasis, thus we highlight the
importance of performing diagnostic tests at intervals for those who have experienced the
disease and out mastectomizado due to disease recurrence probabilities.</p>
      <p>The time of diagnosis of mastectomy is another point to be questioned, there are
women who do not accept the principle surgery, trying to look for other solutions; some
readily accept without question and others have neutral responses, because for these surgery
is the possibility of cure while the mutilation of a body part, a feminine characteristics thus
disagree with the theory proposed by Roy, where we believe that a person can generate
neutral responses at the time of conflict between something that can be good and bad at the
same time, so do not generate responses, either positively or negatively; even for a short
period of time, occurring after a positive or negative response.</p>
      <p>The physical limitation after mastectomy was widely discussed in the study, most of
the women had some limitation of physical, the main problems were related to shoulder
movements; the impossibility of use of accessories, low-cut clothes and change in daily
routine. Roy in his studies believe that the adaptive process is continuous, which leads us to
think that women can take years or even a lifetime, to adapt to the new reality.</p>
      <p>During the research there were reports of loss of self-esteem and a great difficulty
dealing with the loss of the breast, according to Roy featuring a "negative response to the
stimulus." Family and religiosity were reported during the survey, these are very important in
the whole process favoring adaptive reactions; however, our research was to feature the
evaluation of individual adaptive process, i.e., the representatively of cancer to the woman
and not the family processes.</p>
      <p>Our research also aimed to ascertain the assistance of per operative nursing,
comprising the period before, during and after surgery. The result found that there were
differences in the assessment of care provided by nursing professionals, case reports that
characterized the action of these as positive 50%, neglect of case reports 25% and 25%
reported changing the professional attitude over the years. From these results lead us to think
that nurses need to be trained better for their professional performance.</p>
      <p>We completed the research revealing that there were few inefficient or negative
responses by stimuli. We agree with Roy for believing that the person continuously adapts,
100% reported at the end positive response. Roy disagrees because we believe that there
neutral reactions that do not generate responses or positive or negative even for a short
period of time, occurring after a positive or negative response. We emphasize that develop
the activity of thinking can help the woman to accept the proposed therapy. As for nursing
care in the preoperative period, the research identified the need for improvement and
training for nurse’s work in surgical breast procedures, this being a facilitator of adaptive
processes.</p>
      <p>Therefore the role of nursing in the care the woman, who had been subjected to breast
surgery, encompasses care to reverse an altered physiological function, maintaining their
physiological functions and support for those involved in the individual's process as a whole
and their families. Roy's theory assists the practitioner to identify such problems, as well as
contributes to the field of research, because even theories form the basis for hypotheses that
can be tested.</p>
