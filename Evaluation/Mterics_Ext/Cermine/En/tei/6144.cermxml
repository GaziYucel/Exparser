      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Since Croatia became an official EU candidate in June 2004,
public discussions on the benefits and costs of accession have
intensified in many areas. This paper addresses four issues that have attracted
particular attention: How quickly should EU residents get unrestricted
access to Croatia’s property market? How will this affect – or is this
already affecting – the local housing market? What will be the impact
on Croatia’s tourism? And what are the likely macroeconomic effects
of foreign investment inflows into Croatia’s real estate? As is often the
case, serious research has yet to catch up with the enormous public
interest in these issues. This paper is therefore a first attempt to analyse
the issues in a systematic manner and provide guidance for future work
in this area. The main purpose is to stimulate analysis and policy
thinking on these important issues ahead of the upcoming accession
negotiations with the EU.</p>
      <p>Section 2 analyses Croatia’s obligations under Chapter 4 of the
acquis, Freedom of movement of capital, paying particular attention to
the right of EU residents to invest in real estate in candidate countries,
and discusses Croatia’s current regime for property sales to foreigners.
The current regime is rather restrictive, non-transparent and
cumbersome in some respects, but relatively liberal in others. However, a more
important issue is that this regime will eventually have to be
abandoned, thus exposing the economy to potentially large-scale foreign
property investments. For under EU law, EU citizens have unrestricted</p>
      <p>Page 187
187
rights to buy as much property as they like in any EU country without
any need to reside in that country. This means that non-residents will
not be restricted to buying only secondary residences as at present, but
will also be able to buy property for speculative purposes, against
which there is currently only weak protection in the Croatian
legislation. Against this background, Section 2 investigates how Croatia can
improve its negotiating position on this issue. Drawing on the
experience of Denmark and Malta, the section highlights the importance of
the expertise and negotiating skills of officials engaged in accession
talks with the EU. It notes, however, the difficulty of articulating the
view that EU residents should not be allowed to acquire property in
Croatia for an extended period of time, and the importance of
strengthening legislation to protect against property speculation.</p>
      <p>Section 3 analyses potential implications of foreign investment
in real estate for the local housing market. It discusses the main
characteristics of Croatia’s real estate market and reviews recent
developments in housing prices. It finds some empirical evidence that increased
demand for secondary residences by foreigners has led to an increase in
prices of houses and land for construction on the Adriatic. It also
analyses factors that might determine the effects of foreign property
investment on the housing market in the future. These effects will depend on
the speed with which the property market is liberalised; capacity
constraints and competition in the construction industry; the speed with
which legal impediments to property sales are removed; and
developments in household incomes, housing finance and other factors
influencing the affordability of housing. Given the likely supply rigidities,
the section argues that a gradual approach to the opening of the real
estate market to non-residents would allow for a more orderly
adjustment than a rapid removal of restrictions.</p>
      <p>Section 4 considers how increased foreign investment in real
estate could influence Croatia’s tourism industry. To provide insights
into this question, the section analyses the size and main features of
Croatia’s tourism industry. The question that seems particularly
relevant in this context is whether accession to the EU offers the
opportunity for tourism to assume a leading role in overall economic
development, or represents a threat to one of its main assets, the unspoilt coastal
environment. On balance, Croatian tourism stands to benefit from
foreign property investment. The key will be to avoid the risk of
overdevelopment, that is, to ensure strict enforcement of existing building
regulations and of the recently adopted legislation on the protection on the
public coastal domain. Greater foreign ownership of secondary
residences could increase the attractiveness of the Adriatic coast and
islands for other tourists and over the longer term perhaps contribute to
the economic and demographic revival of many now dormant or
abandoned communities.</p>
      <p>Section 5 analyses diverse macroeconomic effects that
increased foreign investment in real estate would have for the Croatian
economy. The wealth effect has already been in evidence for some
time, as the value of houses and land in areas that are attracting foreign
buyers has increased considerably over the past few years. Due to
potentially large capital inflows associated with non-resident real
estate purchases, the section elaborates several arguments for a
gradual opening-up of the market.</p>
      <p>Section 6 summarises the main conclusions and elaborates a
number of policy recommendations.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL</title>
      <p>The EU internal market is based on the principle of the “four
freedoms” of movement: of goods, services, capital and people. As a
general rule, the EU is not willing to accept candidate countries'
requests to limit these freedoms because this could have a significant
impact on competition and the functioning of the internal market.
Croatia – as all EU candidates before it – will thus have to allow
basically unrestricted movement of goods, services, capital and people by
the time it accedes to the EU. The Treaty Establishing the European
Community (Article 56) prohibits in particular all restrictions on
movement of capital between member states but also between the member
states and third countries, although certain restrictions in relation to
countries outside the EU can be retained.</p>
      <p>Freedom of movement of capital is defined in Chapter 4 of the
acquis communitaire. It covers not only payments and transfers of
money across borders, but also transfers of ownership of assets and
liabilities (such as investments in companies and real estate or portfolio
investments) and directives on prevention of money laundering. This
paper discusses only one type of capital movement – the right of EU
residents to purchase real estate in Croatia. Croatia’s obligations in this
regard are currently defined in the Stabilization and Association
Agreement (SAA), (Article 60, point 2):</p>
      <p>Page 189
189
“As from the entry into force of this Agreement, Croatia
shall authorise, by making full and expedient use of its existing
procedures, the acquisition of real estate in Croatia by nationals of
Member States of the European Union, except for areas and matters
listed in Annex VII.i Within four years from the entry into force of
this Agreement, Croatia shall progressively adjust its legislation
concerning the acquisition of real estate in Croatia by nationals of
the Member States of the European Union to ensure the same
treatment as compared to Croatian nationals. At the end of the fourth
year after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Stabilisation
and Association Council shall examine the modalities for extending
these rights to the areas and matters listed in Annex VII.”</p>
      <p>By the time Croatia joins the EU, the SAA will be superseded
by an Accession Treaty. Although the Treaty will be largely based on
the SAA, it may treat a number of issues differently. The whole purpose
of accession negotiations is precisely to agree under what conditions
Croatia will accept, apply and administratively and legally implement
different chapters of the acquis. Commitments under the SAA
regarding non-residents’ right to purchase property in Croatia thus can and, as
argued in this paper, probably should be re-negotiated in the process of
Croatia’s accession to the EU.</p>
      <p>What is the current situation regarding the acquisition of real
estate in Croatia by non-residents? Private non-resident individuals can
already become owners of real estate in Croatia (other than by
inheritance) after obtaining permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
They are restricted to one property, which is limited in size (the
construction site cannot exceed 1,500 m2), and there are areas in which
they may not acquire property, such as protected natural areas,
agricultural land, forests and forest land and certain excluded areas.ii Key
issues in the application procedure, which can reportedly take up to a
year, are the approval of the transaction by the Ministry of Justice and
the existence of a reciprocity agreement on real estate purchases
between Croatia and a given non-resident’s home country.iii For
instance, US residents may be granted permission to buy property in
Croatia because Croatian citizens can acquire property in the United
States without restriction. In contrast, private individuals from Slovenia
cannot acquire property in Croatia because Slovenia and Croatia do not
have a reciprocity agreement in this area.iv</p>
      <p>According to the official data quoted by the news media, 3,200
foreign residents have obtained permission to buy real estate in Croatia
since 1996, when the property market was first opened to foreigners
(Table 1).v Less than 40% of applications have since been approved,
7% have been rejected, and over half have not yet been processed.vi The
number of applications has varied from around 550 per year during
1996-99, to around 1,250 per year since 2000.</p>
      <p>In addition to private non-resident individuals, non-residents who
set up a Croatian company can also acquire property in Croatia. In this
case there is no need for government permission to buy the property
(although there are various other legal and financial considerations) and
the buyer is not restricted to one piece of property. There is no official
information on the number of companies set up for this purpose. However,
since establishing a company normally takes much less than one year and
is not costly, there are indications that many foreigners (in particular from
countries such as Slovenia that do not have reciprocity agreements) make
use of this alternative to acquire real estate in Croatia.vii

      <p>Sources: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted in Jutarnji list (21 October 2004) and
Vjesnik (26 October 2004); author’s calculations</p>
      <p>The existing regime for property sales to foreigners can thus be
characterised as relatively restrictive, non-transparent and cumbersome
in some respects, but relatively liberal in others. In particular, it is not
clear why the processing of applications takes so long and why the
criteria used in evaluating the applications are not transparent and public.
On the other hand, it is important to recognise that current
arrangements with respect to the sale of property to third country residents are
already more liberal than the EU legislation requires: not just EU
nationals, but residents of any country where Croatian citizens have the
right to acquire property can in principle become owners of real estate
in Croatia. Moreover, residents of virtually any country can buy
property if they register a Croatian company.</p>
      <p>How will these arrangements change with implementation of the
SAA and Croatia’s accession to the EU? The main change is that, upon
expiration of the four-year transitional period agreed in the SAA (or
perhaps a longer period yet to be negotiated during accession talks), EU
residents will have the right to buy real estate in Croatia without any
restriction. This means that they will not be restricted to buying only
secondary residences or just one piece of property, and will not be
subject to other conditions, such as prior approval, size, or use of the
property. Under EU law, EU citizens have full rights to buy as much
property as they like in any EU country without any need to reside in that
country. This means that non-residents can also buy property for
speculative purposes, unless this is limited by domestic legislation, which is
largely not the case in Croatia at present.</p>
      <p>It is not clear whether these implications of EU accession are
clear to the Croatian public and to policy makers. In any case, they
have not yet been articulated in public discussion. The real issue is
that the existing restrictions on real estate sales to foreigners,
however imperfect, will eventually have to be lifted, thus exposing the
economy to foreign property investments of potentially far greater
magnitude than anything that has been observed so far. This raises
the question of whether the authorities could or should do something
to keep the existing restrictions in place for more than four years, and
how to better protect in the meantime against property speculation.viii</p>
      <p>At present, commercially motivated property sales in the
secondary market are subject to income tax only if the sale occurs
within three years from the purchase of the property. Part of the capital
gains from such sales is not taxed.ix There seem to be no additional
regulations preventing speculation in the market for land or
uncompleted property. For instance, an entrepreneur could buy up large
swathes of land for construction, or batches of uncompleted
apartments and houses, in the expectation that prices will rise rapidly due
to limited supply, and then resell at a higher price. While the
entrepreneur would pay the regular profits tax, the tax authorities would
not be in a position, as in most mature market economies, to make a
judgement about the fair value of such transactions, and, hence, any
extra profits earned by the entrepreneur due to speculative activity.
The lack of capital largely prevents Croatian citizens from engaging
in such activities at the moment, so the weakness of anti-speculative
regulations may not be obvious. But once the property market is
opened up to non-residents, the lack of capital will no longer
constrain this type of activities, and the weakness of the legislation could
manifest itself very quickly, resulting in the meantime in potentially
large disruptions in local property markets. The remainder of this
section considers only the first issue – whether the authorities could
or should do something to keep in place the existing restrictions on
property sales to non-residents. The issue of anti-speculative
legislation requires a separate expert analysis that goes beyond the scope of
the present paper.</p>
      <p>How have other candidate countries handled the issue of
transitional periods for real estate purchases in their accession negotiations?
The biggest issue in most cases turned out to be the right to purchase
land. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and
Slovakia requested 10-18 year moratoria on the sales of land to EU
residents (Table 2). They justified the need for moratoria by several social
and economic factors, including the high share of the population
working in agriculture; underdeveloped land markets; significantly lower
land prices in candidate countries than in the EU-15; and substantially
lower average income of domestic population relative to EU nationals,
which would give EU nationals an unfair advantage in purchasing
agricultural land in new member states.x</p>
      <p>
        Recognising the high political sensitivity of this issue, the
European Commission proposed in May 2001 that the candidate
countries should be allowed to limit the acquisition of agricultural land by
other EU nationals during a transitional period of seven years after their
accession to the EU
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(European Commission, 2001a)</xref>
        .xi During this
period, the candidate countries would have to use objective, stable,
transparent and public criteria for the authorisation procedures for land
acquisitions. The Commission also proposed a review, to take place
after three years, to determine whether this transitional period could be
shortened or even lifted.
      </p>
      <p>The Commission’s proposal was perceived as a trade-off on a
broader issue of far greater importance to the EU-15, that is, between
the demand of the EU-15 for 5-7 year transition periods for the free
movement of workers from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and
the candidates’ demand for longer transition periods for land
purchases by non-residents. Most candidate countries endorsed and
eventually adopted the Commission’s proposal (Table 2). The only
exception was Poland, which insisted on a longer transition period
fearing that foreign residents might buy relatively cheaply its
abundant reserves of agricultural land. As Poland has by far the largest
population among the new member states and at the same time there
were fears in some old members of the EU that Polish workers might
crowd out domestic labour after the accession, the Polish authorities
managed to negotiate a 12-year moratorium on land purchases by
non-residents in exchange for a seven-year transition period for the
free movement of Polish workers to most EU countries.xii Most
countries also negotiated the possibility to extend the seven-year
transitional period by another three years if a special safeguard clause is
invoked.</p>
      <p>The right of EU nationals to purchase secondary residences in
candidate countries was considerably less controversial. Cyprus, the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia requested five-year
transitional periods, mostly citing concerns about the impact of large-scale real
estate purchases by foreign residents on the prices and affordability of
local housing. The Baltic countries, Bulgaria and Slovenia, allowed EU
residents to purchase secondary residences even before their accession
talks and therefore requested no transitional arrangements at all,
although Slovenia negotiated the right to invoke a general economic
safeguard clause to protect its real estate sector over a period of seven
years. Against this background, it is interesting that some media
reported a different interpretation of Slovenia’s position, according to which
Slovenia tried but did not manage to negotiate a transitional period for
real estate purchases.xiii</p>
      <p>The European Commission’s proposal for a five-year
transitional period for secondary residences was eventually adopted by all
new member states except Malta, which presented a special problem.
Malta’s case is instructive and deserves particular attention because
of some similarities on this issue with the current situation in Croatia
(see Box 1).</p>
      <p>Another interesting example is Denmark. Foreigners are free to
buy real estate in Denmark for business and primary residence
purposes (subject to certain residency restrictions), but not as secondary
homes. In particular, foreigners cannot own holiday homes along the
Danish coast – such properties can only be rented out. This restriction
dates back to the mid-1960s, when Denmark was not yet in the EU and
there were fears that foreigners might buy holiday properties on the
coast for speculative purposes. To prevent speculation, non-residents
were not allowed to own vacation homes that are kept unoccupied most
of the year. Upon accession in 1973, Denmark was allowed to keep this
restriction.xiv</p>
      <p>Page 194
194</p>
      <p>In summary, the cases of Malta and Denmark, along with the
Polish extension of the period for agricultural land purchases by
nonresidents, illustrate that the scope for adopting solutions suiting the
interests of candidate countries is not limited ex ante and depends,
among other things, on the expertise and negotiating skills of public
servants engaged in accession talks with the EU.xv Nevertheless, one</p>
      <p>Page 195
195
should not underestimate the difficulty of negotiations on this point.
The arguments for either the Maltese or the Danish exemption may not
be easily applied to Croatia. Moreover, as discussed in the conclusion,
no country can expect to benefit from the rights of membership if at the
same time it does not want to shoulder the obligations. The challenge in
this particular case will be, first, to identify an important national
interest (if any) in postponing the liberalisation of the real estate market for
non-residents; and second, to demonstrate that applying unrestricted
rights of EU residents to acquire property in Croatia would go against
this interest for an extended period of time. One obvious candidate for
such an interest is the need to limit property speculation. Such a move
would not go against the spirit of EU accession because other EU
member countries have such legislation. The sections that follow elaborate
several other economic arguments that tend to support the case for a
more gradual approach to the liberalisation of the property market.</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>Box 1 How did Malta negotiate an exemption from the complete liberalisation of real estate sales to European Union residents?</title>
        <p>As in Croatia, non-residents – including from non-EU
countries – could acquire property in Malta even before the country’s
accession to the EU. Restrictions on property sales were similar to
those presently used in Croatia – the sale required prior approval,
only one secondary residence of limited size could be acquired by
non-residents, and the value of property had to be above a certain
limit. The rationale for these restrictions was to retain a measure of
control on land use and to prevent speculation. Foreigners could
acquire additional property in Malta beyond the secondary
residence only if they obtained Maltese nationality.</p>
        <p>During accession talks, Malta requested to be able to keep
these restrictions on a permanent basis. The authorities were in
particular concerned that if EU residents had unrestricted access to the
real estate in their small island country, this could lead to more
widespread economic and social problems. They supported their
case by several well-founded arguments.</p>
        <p>First, they argued that, with population of 395,000 and
territory of just 316 km2 (by comparison, Croatian islands of Braè and
Hvar have surface areas of 395 km2 and 300 km2, respectively),
Malta was by far the most densely populated country in the EU-25.
As a result, land available for construction could only cover the
basic needs of the local population.</p>
        <p>Page 196
196</p>
        <p>Second, they argued that, if the right of EU citizens to buy
property in Malta after membership led to an increase in demand for
property, this could affect property prices and have a negative social
impact on Maltese families, especially on young couples. While
housing affordability is not only affected by EU membership – the
property prices have been rising in Malta for many years – Malta’s
concern was that EU membership should not add to the problem by
making housing even less affordable.</p>
        <p>Third, they argued that concerns about housing
affordability in their densely populated country were permanent because,
should a problem arise, it would be greater in future than at present,
affecting future generations more than the current ones. This is why
a transitional period was not sufficient for Malta: only a permanent
arrangement was acceptable.</p>
        <p>The European Commission accepted these arguments and
the EU eventually agreed that Malta may maintain, on a permanent
but non-discriminatory basis, the existing restrictions on the right of
EU citizens to acquire just one secondary residence in Malta.
However, after residing in Malta for at least five years, EU citizens
will be allowed to buy additional property beyond the secondary
residence. The five-year residence requirement was the balance that
was struck between the two diametrically opposed positions in
Maltese and EU law. Under Maltese law, foreigners can never have
full rights to buy property in Malta – that is, to buy property other
than one secondary residence – unless they obtain Maltese
nationality. On the other hand, under EU law, EU citizens have full rights
to buy as much property as they like in any EU country without any
need to reside in that country.</p>

      <title>IMPLICATIONS FOR CROATIA’S REAL</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>ESTATE MARKET</title>
      <p>To understand the broader economic implications of a more
liberal regime for the acquisition of property by foreigners, it is necessary
first to consider some basic features of the real estate market in Croatia.
One should note from the outset that there is very little published
research on the economics of the Croatian property market.xvi
Moreover, statistical data on the real estate market are very patchy.
Given the many transformations of this market (for instance, from
state-owned, to company- and socially-owned, to privately-owned
housing) and institutional differences with western European and
former socialist countries, an empirical research programme on the
economics of the real estate market would be extremely useful for
researchers, policy makers and the real estate industry. This section can
in no way fill this gap; it will only attempt to outline those features of
the real estate market that might be relevant in the course of Croatia’s
EU accession.</p>
      <p>The real estate market is usually one of the most closely watched
sectors in mature market economies. It plays a crucial role not only
because housing accounts for the bulk of the personal wealth, but also
because of linkages with key investment, saving, and consumption
choices of households and businesses. In addition, the real estate
market affects competitiveness as a major input in the productive capacity,
in particular in service oriented economies such as Croatia’s, and as an
important determinant of banking and equity market performance, both
of which are highly affected by movements in property prices.</p>
      <p>The real estate market in Croatia is still relatively small –
construction and real estate industries account for around 13% of GDP,
compared with 20-25% of GDP in many industrial countries, indicating
considerable potential for future growth. The real estate market started
to develop in earnest in the second half of the 1990s, after most of the
housing and commercial property stock inherited from the socialist
period had been privatised. Privatisation of housing led to an increase
in the already high proportion of both privately-owned and
owneroccupied housing. According to the 2001 Census, 96% of the 1.4
million permanently occupied dwellings in Croatia are owned by private
individuals, and 83% are owner-occupied dwellings.xvii For
comparison, in western Europe the share of housing owned by private
individuals ranges from about 60% in Austria and Sweden to 90-95% in
Belgium, Greece, Spain and Portugal; while the share of
owner-occupied housing ranges from 38% in Germany to 80% in Ireland (OECD,
2001).xviii Croatia is in this respect similar to some other CEE countries,
where privatisation has also resulted in a high level of owner-occupied
housing.xix</p>
      <p>There is little reliable information about the state of the housing
stock in Croatia. Comparing the total number of households (1.48
million) with the number of permanently occupied dwellings indicates a
small deficit in the housing stock (about 56,000 dwellings in 2001).xx
However, if one considers the additional stock of about 200,000
dwellings that are temporarily unoccupied, the number of dwellings
exceeds the number of households by about 10%.xxi</p>
      <p>
        The picture on the regional distribution of the housing stock is
also unclear. The Ministry of Environmental Protection, Physical
Planning and Construction (MZOUP, 2003:35) argues that there is a
significant shortage of housing in middle-sized and large cities, and at the
same time a significant surplus of housing in small towns. Large
differences in apartment prices between cities such as Zagreb and Karlovac
would tend to support this view. However,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">Tica (2004)</xref>
        argues that if
temporarily unoccupied dwellings are counted, all Croatian counties,
including the city of Zagreb, have a surplus in the housing stock.
      </p>
      <p>Regarding housing supply, defined here as the flow of new
housing (the “primary” market) plus sales of existing homes (the
“secondary” market), the available data suggest that supply in the primary
market is relatively tight. During 1996-2001, about 13,600 dwellings
were on average completed each year.xxii To compare this figure with
just one segment of the potential demand for housing, there were on
average 70% more marriages (about 23,000) each year during this
period. In international comparison, with an average of 3 newly completed
dwellings per 1,000 inhabitants during 1996-2001, Croatia is near the
bottom relative to western Europe, although it compares favourably
with other central and eastern European countries (Figure 1).

        .
      </p>
      <p>Although there are no comprehensive data on sales in the
secondary market, the available indicators suggest that the supply is
constrained in this market as well. Perhaps the most important reason is
that many properties – including many of those temporarily unoccupied
– do not have clean titles, so many potential trades cannot be realised.
As discussed below, this state of affairs is due to huge backlogs in the
judiciary, the often chaotic state of property registers and deficiencies
in urban planning and the enforcement of building relations.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, much of the housing stock has been privatised to
occupiers for nominal payments or at no cost. Privatisation thus
resulted in windfall gains according to who happened to be living in a
dwelling at the time. Many people therefore occupy dwellings that they
would not otherwise be in a position to afford. Such properties are not
likely to be offered for sale, which limits the effective supply.</p>
      <p>The third reason is that standards of construction were often
poor, resulting in problems with the quality of many existing dwellings.
According to the 2001 Census, one-third of Croatia’s housing stock is
older than 45 years (i.e., constructed up to 1960); 60% was constructed
between 1961 and 1990; and only 8% since 1991. From an investment
point of view, the amortisation period for buildings is usually 50 years,
so the bulk of the housing stock in Croatia is close to or past its useful
life. This also means that privatisation has saddled many occupiers with
liabilities in the form of high maintenance obligations.</p>
      <p>Finally, as part of the economic transformation, the public sector
has largely pulled out of the housing construction business, while private
firms have not yet expanded sufficiently to bridge the gap in all segments
of the market. In particular, the financial problems of the public sector
have resulted in a sharp decline in the construction of social housing.</p>
      <p>On the basis of these observations, one can form a working
hypothesis that the supply of housing is presently tight in both primary
and secondary markets. The question is, then, what is the likely impact
of growing demand for vacation homes by foreigners on the residential
property market? In particular, how realistic are fears, often expressed
in the public, that rising prices of summer vacation homes along the
Adriatic coast could spill over to the local housing market and
negatively affect the affordability of housing for ordinary Croatian households?</p>
      <p>The potentially most important channel for the transmission of
price increases from the market for secondary residences to the
residential housing market is the expectations channel. As with all assets,
current prices of real estate depend on expectations of future prices. The
housing market seems to be tight at the moment, so price increases in
the market for secondary residences are likely to be rapidly transmitted
to other segments of the market. Most relevant in this context is the
market situation on the Adriatic coast and islands, where most of the
property sales to foreigners are taking place. The number of permanent
dwellings on the coast and islands was 355,000 in 2001.xxiii In addition,
Croatians owned on the Adriatic about 118,000 vacation homes in
2001, which represented two-thirds of the total number of such homes
in Croatia. Thus, vacation homes are already a key segment of the
housing market on the Adriatic, accounting for a quarter of the total housing
stock in this region. Moreover, domestic and international media
indicate growing interest of foreigners in buying property on the Adriatic,
including for investment purposes.xxiv According to the news media,
prices of houses and land for construction have risen by 20-30% over
the past two years, and by 50-100% in most attractive locations such as
the old city of Dubrovnik.xxv</p>
      <p>Given the relative size of this market segment and of reported
price increases, it is conceivable that rising prices of summer vacation
homes and of land for construction could, as postulated above, spill
over to the housing market for local residents and affect house prices
and affordability. Yet in the primary market there is no evidence to
substantiate these concerns. The average prices of newly completed
apartments declined sharply after a run-up in 1999, and their growth
remained negative during 2000 and 2001 (Figure 2). In 2003, prices
increased only in Zagreb (by about 10%), while in the first half of 2004,
prices of newly completed apartments declined in all locations.

change)</p>

      <p>Data on sales of existing homes and land for construction
provide more support for the spillover hypothesis. Between March and
November 2004, house prices on the Adriatic increased at an annual
rate of 10%, and prices of land for construction at an annual rate of 30%
(Table 3). At the same time, house prices in Zagreb increased much
more rapidly, while apartment prices on the Adriatic actually fell,
indicating that property prices are also under strong influence of factors
other than non-resident demand for vacation properties. Nevertheless,
rising prices of houses and land for construction on the Adriatic reflect
at least in part expectations about the future demand of foreign buyers.
This is also confirmed by anecdotal evidence.xxvi More importantly,
rising prices of land for construction can be interpreted as a leading
indicator of future increases in house prices on the Adriatic.</p>
      <p>Given the lack of comprehensive statistical data on property
sales in the secondary market, the above results need to be interpreted
with caution. Data used to construct Table 3 come from a commercial
source, which publishes data at weekly frequency and with a relatively
detailed breakdown. However, these data do not cover all properties
offered for sale, and only indicate prices that are being asked by sellers
rather than actual transactions prices. Because real estate sales are
subject to the value-added tax or the property sales tax, Croatian tax
authorities reportedly maintain a large data base on transactions in the
secondary market.xxvii However, these data are not published, nor have
they been made available to researchers.

      <p>The Croatian Bureau of Statistics only publishes data on average
prices of newly completed apartments, on a quarterly basis and with
considerable delay (these data were used in Figure 2). The news media,
on the other hand, suffer from sample bias: they tend to focus on
properties in exceptional locations, often bought by domestic and
international celebrities. The prices of such properties do not characterise
general trends in the housing market, but they nevertheless affect market
sentiment and sellers’ expectations, which is reflected in figures
reported in Table 3 and has also been reported by market participants. For
instance, many real estate agents consider prices of properties offered
for sale to be overvalued by about 30% on average.xxviii</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, will the current conditions of relatively tight
housing supply and rising prices of at least some houses and land for
construction ease or become more pronounced with the opening-up of
the market to non-residents? And what role will the speed of
liberalisation play in this process?</p>
      <p>Arguments supporting the view that pressures on the local
property market might intensify fall into three categories. First, the number
of properties sold to foreigners has been small to date. As noted above,
since 1996 only about 3,200 property sales to foreigners have been
approved. Even if the true number of realised sales is twice as high (due
to provisions that allow foreigners to buy property via registered
companies), this would represent less than 2% of the stock of permanent
housing on the Adriatic (5% of the stock of summer vacation homes).
Such a small market segment clearly cannot influence the overall real
estate market. In the future, however, foreign demand for secondary
residences is likely to be much higher, and might therefore have a more
significant impact on developments in the housing market. As of
September 2004, real estate brokers estimated the number of potential
sales already in the pipeline at about 10,000 houses.xxix This is
equivalent to 75% of the average annual supply of new housing in the entire
country. A demand shock of this size would clearly have a big impact
on the local housing market, even if the sales were realised over a
period of 2-3 years.</p>
      <p>The second concern relates to construction costs. If the
construction industry is operating at full capacity, increased demand for
vacation homes by non-residents will put pressure on housing construction
costs in the short run, which will spill over to the market for permanent
housing. To the extent that the construction industry is not competitive,
the increase in costs – and hence the spillover on the local housing
market – will be so much the higher. One should note that in the long run
housing supply is elastic with respect to both income and price, so
capacity in the construction industry is not likely to be a factor
constraining the supply of housing. But cost spillovers may be present in
the short run and affect expectations of future prices, in particular if
there is a sudden increase in demand.</p>
      <p>The third concern is that for an average family the affordability
of housing is already low, so that any spillover of price increases and
construction costs due to the opening-up of the property market to
foreigners might make housing even less affordable for the local
population. However, concerns about affordability relate primarily to access to
housing finance and public housing policy, and have little to do with
non-residents’ demand for vacation properties (see Box 2).</p>
      <p>The main argument supporting the view that demand from
nonresidents will not affect future supply and price of local housing is that
legal uncertainties relating to property transactions will be gradually
removed as Croatia approaches membership in the EU and starts
implementing the acquis communitaire. As noted above, many properties
desired by foreign as well as domestic buyers do not have clean titles,
so many potential trades have not been realised. In such circumstances
it is not surprising that properties with clean title fetch higher prices.
More importantly, legal uncertainty is presently constraining the
potential supply of permanent housing in the secondary market. Clean
property titles and orderly and more efficient cadastres will most likely
bring many houses, apartments and pieces of land that are currently
withheld from it onto the market, including some of the 200,000
temporarily unoccupied dwellings mentioned above.</p>
      <p>The speed with which the property market is opened up to
nonresidents can tip the balance of these forces in an important way.
Keeping restrictions on foreign ownership in place might sustain
relatively high prices by limiting the supply of vacation properties to
nonresidents. However, the prices of such properties and real estate in
general are bound to increase anyway with rising incomes in the long
run.xxx The issue is then, how fast will prices of vacation properties
converge to their long-term equilibrium? Given the apparent interest of
foreigners in the Croatian property market, it is likely that a rapid removal
of restrictions would lead to a large increase in demand for secondary
residences, while at the same time the supply response would be less
elastic due to legal constraints and limited capacity in construction
industry. This would, ceteris paribus, imply faster convergence to
longrun equilibrium prices, but with potentially significant spillovers onto
the local housing market along the way. On the other hand, a more</p>
      <p>Page 204
gradual removal of restrictions would allow more time for the supply to
respond to foreign demand, thereby limiting price increases in the short
run and lowering costs of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium.</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>Box 2 Affordability of housing, housing finance and public housing</title>
        <p>Contrary to widespread beliefs, the affordability of housing
has not declined in recent years. Except in 1999, net earnings were
growing faster than average prices of new housing (Figure 3).
However, the index of housing affordability is very low in Croatia:
an average annual income in 2003 was equivalent to the average
price of just 5.5 m2 of a newly completed apartment. In other words,
one family member would need to put aside his or her entire
annual income for ten years in order to save enough for a modest 55m2
apartment, assuming that average income and apartment prices
grow at the same rate. Affordability of housing is therefore a
legitimate concern. However, one should not jump to the conclusion that
housing would become more affordable if foreign ownership of real
estate was more restricted. Housing affordability depends on many
factors that have no connection to demand for vacation homes by
non-residents. Two factors that are examined here are housing
finance and public housing policy.

on the speed with which the property market is opened up; capacity
constraints and competition in the construction industry; the speed with
which legal impediments to property sales are removed; and
developments in household incomes, housing finance and other factors
influencing the affordability of housing. In general, however, given the
supply rigidities, one could expect that a measured approach to the
opening of the real estate market to non-residents would allow for a more
orderly adjustment than a rapid removal of restrictions.</p>

      <title>IMPACT OF EUROPEAN UNION ACCESSION</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>ON CROATIA’S TOURISM INDUSTRY</title>
      <p>The preceding sections identified the right of EU nationals to
acquire property in Croatia as an important issue in forthcoming accession
negotiations, and discussed potential implications of foreign investment in
real estate for the local housing market. This section considers how
developments on this front might influence Croatia’s tourism industry.</p>
      <p>As with the real estate market, the lack of rigorous economic
analysis and adequate statistical data on tourism make it difficult to
assess even the size and economic potential of this industry, let alone
its dynamics in the context of Croatia’s accession to the EU. One of the
few analytical studies available is a report by the World Travel and
Tourism Council (2004), which uses the methodology of tourism
satellite accounts (TSA), developed by the OECD and the World Tourism
Organization in the 1990s.xxxix This methodology aims at identifying
more precisely different industries supplying the tourism output, and
thus offers policy makers better insights into economic and other
effects of tourism (see Annex).</p>
      <p>The TSA methodology clearly indicates that travel and tourism
is a key economic activity in Croatia: its contribution to GDP in 2003
is estimated at 28% ($8 billion), and to total employment at 21%
(294,000 jobs) (Table 4).xl The bulk of this contribution ($4.6 billion,
equivalent to 16% of GDP) comes from spending by international
visitors on goods and services (so-called visitor exports). In terms of
national accounts, travel and tourism contribute 44% of total exports,
absorb 19% of total imports; and account for 11% of personal
consumption and 11% of capital investment.</p>
      <p>In international comparison, Croatia ranks 22nd among more
than 160 countries in terms of the share of travel and tourism in GDP</p>
      <p>Page 208
(well ahead of Austria, Greece, Italy, Switzerland and new member
states from central Europe); 16th in terms of the share of travel and
tourism in total employment (behind Turkey, but well ahead of the
countries mentioned above); and 13th in terms of the share of travel and
tourism exports in total exports. However, in terms of government
expenditure on tourism, Croatia lags far behind: national and local
government agencies in Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary,
Italy and Switzerland spend between 3,5% and 7,5% of their total
expenditure on tourism-related services, compared with just 1% in
Croatia. This seems far too low, because local government initiatives
(for instance, promotion of agro-tourism in Istria) can broaden the
spectrum of services offered, increase tourist expenditure and perhaps
extend the tourist season. The report sees strong growth prospects for
Croatia’s travel and tourism industry, which is projected to expand by
nearly 7% per annum over the next ten years, much faster than either
EU or world-wide demand for tourism.</p>
      <p>Table 4 Tourism Satellite Account for Croatia, 2003</p>

        <p>Page 209
209</p>
        <p>The question that arises against this background is to what
extent the expected increase in investment in Croatian real estate by
residents of the EU might change the outlook for and the character of
travel and tourism industry over the medium term. One issue that seems
particularly relevant in this context is whether accession to the EU
offers the opportunity for tourism to assume a leading role in overall
economic development, or represents the threat to what is widely
considered to be the last remaining environmentally unspoiled area of the
Mediterranean within easy reach of major European cities. To address
these issues, it is necessary first to consider the main features of tourism
in Croatia. As it turns out, Croatian tourism is in many respects very
similar to tourism in other southern European countries, so useful
lessons can be learned by referring to the experience of these countries.</p>
        <p>
          The first point to note is that tourism in Croatia, as in other
southern European countries, is dominated by international mass
tourism. The main object of mass tourism is the beach holiday, with its
natural (coastal environment, climate) and man-made ingredients
(restaurants, hotels, etc) marketed as “sunshine and sea” packages
providing an escape from the routines of domestic and work life. This
social image of tourism and the lack of product differentiation imply a
high degree of substitutability among different Mediterranean resorts.
They offer similar experiences – the sunshine and sea are
interchangeable – and virtually the only point of competition is price.xli Efforts to
develop “elite” tourism focusing on high-income visitors or
“sustainable” tourism aimed at keeping tourism resources available for future
generations are not likely to succeed in replacing incomes generated by
the mass tourism industry, which brings 8-9 million tourists to Croatia
or 50 million tourists to Spain each year.xlii The Common Agricultural
Policy of the EU, with its emphasis on farmers as keepers of the
environment and on diversification of tourist destinations, has provided a
boost to rural tourism in the EU, but while important in rural areas, the
net effect on the tourist industry has been minimal
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(Williams, 2001)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>The second characteristic of mass tourism is its extreme
vulnerability to developments over which the industry itself has little control.
One example is tourism’s high elasticity in relation to incomes.xliii
Given that tourist activity does not, in the main, meet a vital need,
tourist behaviour is highly volatile and subject to psychological and
social influences, personal sensitivities, fashion, and short term
reactions. If the image of just one link in the chain is affected, then the
whole tourism industry suffers consequences. The most obvious
manifestation of this sensitivity is the impact of political uncertainty or the</p>
        <p>Page 210
security situation of tourist arrivals in a given country or region.
Croatia’s experience during the 1990s is a clear case in point. However,
the issue is present worldwide, especially since the terrorist attacks of
11 September 2001.xliv</p>
        <p>The tourism practiced in Croatia and other southern European
countries is also characterised by a potentially high level of systemic
risk on the supply side. Threshold levels of capital and skills required
for starting a tourism business – for instance, the letting of rooms – are
relatively low. This means that there is a high elasticity of supply.
While this has provided an important opportunity for social and
economic mobility for lower income households, most of which used to
be engaged in agriculture, the ease of entry into the tourism market
may threaten the longer-term competitiveness of established tourist
areas as new resorts develop. Moreover, it may threaten the
competitiveness of existing resorts through overdevelopment and devastation
of the landscape. This problem has been particularly pronounced in
Croatia, where weaknesses of spatial planning and local
administration, misplaced government incentives, and failure to control
clandestine (“wild”) construction have forced the authorities to take drastic
measures to prevent overbuilding and protect the public coastal
domain (see Box 3).</p>
        <sec id="sec-7-1-1">
          <title>Box 3 Clandestine construction and protection of the public coastal domain</title>
          <p>
            Clandestine construction has been a longstanding issue in
southern European countries
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(see Mullins, 1991)</xref>
            and has recently
become a major issue in Croatia. The phenomenon has diverse
origins but a common outcome – devastation of the coastal
environment, which is a key ingredient of the main tourism product of these
countries, and hence a serious threat to their competitiveness.
          </p>
          <p>The proximate causes of clandestine construction are
deficiencies of spatial planning and local administration, and the failure
of the authorities to enforce building regulations.xlv But the ultimate
cause is more likely to be the lack of clearly defined property rights.
This problem was highlighted by de Soto (2000) in his seminal
study on establishing capitalism in developing countries. To
illustrate the problem, de Soto tried to open a small garment factory in
Peru. He discovered that to obtain a license to operate such a small
business took 289 days and cost 31 times the average yearly
minimum wage.xlvi Not surprisingly, most people bypassed the process,
operating without a license. De Soto concluded that developing and</p>
          <p>Page 211
211
former socialist countries' principal problem in fostering private
sector development was how to provide easy access to legal
mechanisms such as property titles for land, houses and other assets that
indigenous entrepreneurs own de facto but not de jure. Without
property titles, people have no transferable rights of ownership with
which to establish and operate their businesses.</p>
          <p>In the case of Croatia, these problems have manifested
themselves in long delays in obtaining clean property titles and
building permits. For instance, Croatian courts have accumulated
some 400,000 unresolved cases of property claims.xlvii There have
also been many clear violations of regulations on spatial planning
and construction, which captured domestic news headlines and
prompted the authorities to take determined measures, including the
demolition of illegally constructed dwellings.xlviii But misplaced
incentives are also partly to blame. Until recently, the government
subsidised loans for start-up businesses in tourism with the aim for
promoting self-employment. However, most loans were used for
construction of tourist apartments, often without building
permits.xlix</p>
          <p>
            To prevent further infringement of the coastline, the
government passed in September 2004 Regulation on the protection of the
coastal public domain
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Government of Croatia, 2004)</xref>
            . This
regulation is similar to Spain’s Ley de las Costas, passed in 1988 in
response to environmental backlash against the overdevelopment of
the coastlines, including by foreigners who acquired a large number
of secondary residences.l The regulation protects all islands, the sea
within 300 meters of the coastline, and coastal areas within 1
kilometre. It prohibits the construction of new houses and tourist
apartments within 70 meters of the coastline. Except for infrastructure
facilities, new construction within 100 meters of the coastline will
be allowed only in the case of hotels and restaurants in specially
designated areas. The regulation also restricts other construction in
settlements where the majority of the population is local as well as
in tourist resorts.
          </p>
          <p>While this regulation may help solve some of the most acute
problems of construction in coastal areas, Croatia will continue to
face problems of the protection of the public coastal domain on a
permanent basis, given that tourism results in extreme pressures on
the local economy and environment at a few points in time and
space. In particular, 95% of hotel and restaurant accommodation
capacity in Croatia is located on the Adriatic Coast and islands, and
over 60% of overnight stays are recorded in July and August.</p>
          <p>
            A further notable development has been a pronounced tendency
towards self-provisioning. It has been most visible in the
accommodation sector and has started with the growth of second home ownership
of local residents. The growth of “weekend homes” in Croatia and
other southern European countries is also a broader economic and
social phenomenon. In the former Yugoslavia it was partly a
consequence of scarcity of other goods and services on the market on which
to spend income on the one hand, and the basically free provision of
services such as housing, education and health care on the other. At the
same time, the widespread distribution of second homes across social
classes and geographical locations reflects the persistence of
ruralurban ties, with first generation urban dwellers inheriting homes in the
countryside. Moreover, owning a weekend home in a coastal resort is a
widely held aspiration and status symbol in all social classes, a part of
the mythology of what constitutes social progress
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(Williams, 2001)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>With enlargement of the EU to Portugal and Spain and the
removal of restrictions on the movement of capital in the Union in the
1990s, there has also been a marked increase in second home
ownership of foreign residents. For instance, in Spain there are an estimated
2 million second homes, one million of which are owned by foreigners
(ibid., 2001). However, if the experience of other southern European
countries can be a guide, one should not expect a significant increase in
direct foreign ownership of tourist facilities other than second homes.li
The reason is that foreign companies are mainly interested in facilities
they can differentiate through branding and location, such as hotels
aimed at business travellers or exclusive resorts. On the other hand, the
tourism product being sold by Croatia (sun, sea, etc.) is largely
indifferent to branding and location, so the emphasis is almost entirely on the
value for money of the total holiday package. This situation is not
likely to change with the growth of foreign ownership of vacation homes.</p>
          <p>
            What are the major potential costs and benefits of increased
foreign ownership of summer vacation homes for Croatian tourism? As
noted above, the main potential cost is that of overdevelopment. Since
this can result in the devastation of the coastal environment, which is
one of the key attractions for tourists visiting Croatia, it would result in
a loss of competitiveness for the tourism industry. One should also
emphasise that there are many tourist attractions other than real estate
on the Adriatic (see
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">Kušen, 2002</xref>
            ) that are not adequately protected and
will need to be considered in the context of the opening-up of the real
estate market to non-residents. The recent strengthening of building
regulations in coastal areas and the reasoned expectation that EU
residents will respect these and other regulations (unlike many domestic
developers in the past), provide some assurance that Croatia, unlike
many coastal areas of Spain for instance, will avoid the overbuilding
scenario. However, the authorities, in particular at the local level,
should avoid complacency on this crucial issue, as weaknesses in the
enforcement of building regulations have a long history in Croatia. The
speed with which the real estate market is opened up to foreigners could
make a difference here as well – a sudden increase in demand for
vacation homes could increase incentives for local governments and
developers to bypass the recently introduced building regulations and cash in
on the interest of foreign buyers as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p>Other potential costs for tourism are few and largely unrelated to
foreign ownership of vacation homes. Croatia’s tourism will in all
likelihood continue to face the same challenges that it grapples with today:
how to encourage greater market and product diversification; invest
more in effective marketing and promotion; develop the human capital
and technologies required for growth; create a more stable and
predictable regulatory environment; match public and private infrastructure
to customer demand; and promote responsibility in natural, social and
cultural environments. It is unlikely that widespread foreign ownership
of secondary residences will add to this long list of problems, the
solutions for which are by and large well known but are difficult to
implement because of the lack of co-ordination among different public and
private sector bodies and weaknesses in local administration.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, increased foreign ownership of secondary
residences could have a number of potentially significant benefits for
tourism and local communities. With the revival of interest by foreign
buyers, houses and land that until recently had little or no economic
value have practically overnight become a potentially important source
of wealth for indigenous owners and local communities. In addition,
much of the existing housing stock could be renewed by foreigners
interested in owning old stone houses build in the authentic
architectural style of this part of the Mediterranean. This would increase
attractiveness of the Adriatic Coast and islands for other tourists as well.</p>
          <p>
            Foreign investment in real estate could also revive local
communities on the Adriatic. Demographic trends in many coastal
communities and on most islands have been unfavourable ever since the late 19th
century, and these trends seem to have accelerated over the past decade
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(see Wertheimer-Baletiae, 2003)</xref>
            . This has resulted in lack of investment
in housing, infrastructure and public services, with possibly tens of
thousands of old houses falling into disrepair and many villages being
abandoned. A trend observed in other southern European countries is
that many second homes eventually become the principal homes of
expatriate settlers, thereby generating year-round income streams and
permanent jobs in local communities. These jobs might in turn lead to
the establishment of many new households on the Adriatic, which
could over time perhaps reverse negative demographic trends. The
clearest examples of this course of development worldwide are the US
states of Arizona and Florida, where many previously dormant
communities have been transformed into vibrant centres of development after
erstwhile tourists from northern states established their permanent
residence in the south.
          </p>
          <p>
            Local authorities and indigenous entrepreneurs would thus be
well advised to use the current period of strong interest in Croatia as a
tourist destination to plan for the future. Sooner or later, the demand
and the supply are likely to shift – tourism, like any industry, cannot
avoid changes in consumer preferences and the product life cycle. Or to
put it differently, tourism is neither “a passport to development” nor a
“unique devil”
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(de Kadt, 1979)</xref>
            ; its role in economic development
depends on the form of tourism and on the structure of the national and
regional economies within which it is inserted.

      <title>MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS</title>
      <p>What are the likely effects of increased foreign investment in
secondary residences on the national economy?</p>
      <p>One important macroeconomic effect – the wealth effect – has
already been in evidence for some time. As noted above, the value of
real estate and land in areas that are attracting potential buyers has
increased even ahead of any large-scale property sales to foreigners.
This clearly demonstrates the powerful impact that economic
expectations exert on current asset valuations. It also implies that any
tightening of restrictions on property sales to foreigners would result in wealth
losses. In an extreme case, prohibiting the sales of real estate to
foreigners would wipe out billions of euros of potential wealth of Croatian
citizens and a proportionate amount of tax revenues.</p>
      <p>Another key macroeconomic effect relates to the potentially
large capital inflows associated with non-residents’ payments for
properties purchased in Croatia. Considering only the estimate of house
purchases that are currently being arranged – the sales of 10,000 houses
mentioned above – and assuming a very conservative average price of
50,000 euros per house, capital inflows already in the pipeline would
amount to about 500 million euros, or nearly 2% of GDP. To put this
number in perspective, it is equivalent to the average annual net issuance
of international bonds by the Croatian government during 1995-2003, or
to 50% of the average annual inflows of foreign direct investment. An
overly rapid liberalisation of the real estate market could thus unleash
potentially significant appreciation pressures on the kuna, which could
have important effects on the external competitiveness of the economy
as a whole and export industries, including tourism.</p>
      <p>The wealth effect and the associated capital inflows will be
initially distributed among property and land owners on the one side, and
the construction and real estate development industries on the other.
Depending on how the income thus generated is spent and invested, one
can envisage a number of different macroeconomic scenarios. One
possibility is that property and land owners will use the bulk of the
proceeds of real estate sales to finance personal consumption, while the
construction and real estate development industries will use additional
revenue largely to raise wages and dividend payments. This would
result in rapid growth of personal consumption and imports,
inflationary pressures, deterioration of the external current account, and
eventually loss of competitiveness. Another possibility is that the capital
generated by the real estate sales is reinvested in local housing, tourism
enterprises, or other sectors of the economy. This would lead to demand
pressures and additional imports as well, but in contrast to the former
scenario the productive capacity of the economy would increase,
helping to maintain longer-term competitiveness. Finally, the proceeds of
property sales could be reinvested abroad, so the net effect of the inflow
could be more or less offset by capital outflows.</p>
      <p>There would in addition be a series of second round effects
stemming from the consumption and investment patterns of foreign
owners of secondary residences. If the residences are rented out to
foreign holiday makers who would otherwise purchase accommodation
from domestic owners of hotels or apartments, the income stream from
tourism might be reduced. However, if secondary residences become
the principal homes of foreign buyers, as has been suggested above,
they may generate permanent income streams for local communities
and the domestic economy.</p>
      <p>The effects of property sales to foreigners on fiscal revenues are
likely to be positive. The sales as well as any increase in personal
consumption resulting from the sales will generate additional VAT
revenue. Likewise, additional personal and corporate incomes generated
by investing the proceeds of sales will at least partly be subject to
income taxes. The overall fiscal effect will then depend on how
additional revenue is spent by the local communities and the central
government. Here one could consider the same scenarios as with personal
consumption and investment: if additional fiscal revenues are spent on
current public consumption, domestic demand pressures (and possibly
imports) will increase; if they are invested in education, debt
repayment, infrastructure, improvements in the functioning of public
services and institutions etc, demand pressures may increase, but the
competitive position of the economy will improve in the long run.</p>
      <p>All of these effects have yet to be researched, so at present it is
not possible to assess with any degree of certainty the likely
macroeconomic effects of foreign investment in Croatia’s property.
Nevertheless, given the size of potential wealth effects and capital
inflows, there are solid economic arguments in favour of a gradual
rather than a swift liberalisation of the property market.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION AND POLICY</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>RECOMMENDATIONS</title>
      <p>The main conclusion from the preceding analysis is that Croatia
stands to benefit in the long term from foreign investment in the
property sector, but in the medium term a measured approach to the
opening-up of the market can be justified on a number of grounds. These
include spillovers of price increases from the market for secondary
residences onto the local housing market (of which there is already some
evidence); costs of adjustment in the housing market and construction
industry to a sudden large increase in demand for secondary residences;
loss of competitiveness in the tourism industry in the case of violations
of building regulations and the resulting overdevelopment of coastal
areas (the incentives for which would increase if the property market is
opened up suddenly); and macroeconomic pressures arising from large
and sudden capital inflows.</p>
      <p>Another general conclusion is that much additional research
needs to be done on the economics of the real estate market, tourism</p>
      <p>Page 217
and on the macroeconomic effects of developments in the property
market. In particular, major efforts at improving statistical information
on the real estate market and tourism are necessary. For instance,
without comprehensive information on transactions in the market for
existing homes or in the housing construction industry, it is not possible to
assess the overall state of the housing market, nor can one develop
useful scenarios for the diverse macroeconomic effects of foreign
investment in the property sector. In addition, the analysis has identified a
number of weaknesses in the current legislative framework, from
regulations on property sales to foreigners, to inadequate legislation
protecting against property speculation, to the well-known problems with
property titles, cadastres, and enforcement of building and spatial
planning regulations.</p>
      <p>Against this background, what approach could Croatia follow in
negotiations on the free movement of capital with the EU? The
difficulty of negotiations on this point can be better understood when put in the
proper perspective of the way that negotiations are conducted. By
joining the EU, a country accepts to adopt and apply the rules of the club.
Exceptionally, the EU agrees that certain rules can be adopted over a
longer time horizon after membership, provided that exceptions are
limited in scope and in time. Exceptions are therefore temporary in
nature and granted to allow a country sufficient time to adapt. In the
case of Croatia, a transitional period for investment in real estate
lasting four years from the entry into force of the SAA has already been
agreed. However, Croatian authorities could decide to extend this
period once negotiations on EU membership begin. But since other
requests for transitional periods will undoubtedly be made in the
negotiation process, the authorities will need to set up priorities among
different areas, deciding whether, for instance, it is more important to
request a longer transitional period for the real estate sector or for
adjustment in agriculture.</p>
      <p>
        Yet, if transitional periods are exceptional, it is evident that
permanent arrangements – also known as derogations – are practically
ruled out. The reason is that by their very nature derogations go against
the principle that the law is equal for all
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Busuttil, 2002)</xref>
        . Derogations
also go against the spirit of acting in common, because they allow a
country to operate outside the scope of the law binding all the rest. If
derogations applied in all cases, there would be no common action and
there would be little scope for having the EU at all. No country can
expect to benefit from the rights of membership if, at the same time, it
does not want to shoulder the obligations.
      </p>
      <p>Although Section 2 highlighted some examples in EU law
where derogations have been granted to individual countries to allow
them to operate differently from the rest – for instance, the cases of
Malta and Denmark in respect of restrictions on foreign ownership of
secondary residences, and Poland in respect of agricultural land
purchases by non-residents – it is not likely that Croatia will be able to
wring any meaningful concessions out of the EU. The reason is that it
would be very hard to prove that Croatia has a paramount reason for not
allowing EU residents to buy property beyond one secondary residence.
Inadequate legislation against property speculation is a weak excuse –
adopting such legislation is in the interests of the country already, as
domestic residents could engage in such activities. Likewise, it is not in
the long-run economic interest of Croatian citizens and the authorities
to further restrict foreign ownership of real estate, as this would wipe
out considerable amounts of potential wealth and fiscal revenue. A well
articulated public discussion could nevertheless help in formulating
arguments to support Croatia’s case on this and other important issues,
and in deciding on the priority areas that need adjustment and hence
longer transitional periods.</p>
      <p>Turning to the real estate market, Section 3 identified two
channels through which the opening of Croatia’s real estate market to EU
residents could affect housing prices and affordability: expectations of
future price increases, and housing supply rigidities in the event a rapid
liberalisation leads to a sudden increase in demand for property by
foreign investors. Recommendations in this area are therefore more
straightforward. First, the authorities need to stabilise the expectations
that a housing boom on the Adriatic is imminent. Particularly helpful in
this respect would be a more transparent and efficient application of
existing regulations on sales of real estate to foreigners, and the
continued determined implementation of the latest regulation on housing
construction and protection of the coastal public domain.</p>
      <p>Second, much can be done to improve the legislative framework
and administrative procedures for property transactions. Legal
uncertainty is probably a major constraint on the potential supply of
permanent housing in the secondary market at present. Clean property titles
and orderly and more efficient cadastres would bring to the market
many houses, apartments and pieces of land that are currently withheld
from the market.</p>
      <p>Third, one aspect of housing finance that is visible in most
industrial countries and many new EU members but is absent in Croatia
is involvement of the state in the mortgage market. Hungary and
Poland, for instance, introduced legislation on mortgage bonds and
mortgage banks following the German approach, while in Bulgaria, the
Czech Republic, Latvia, and Slovakia commercial banks can obtain a
mortgage banking license and issue mortgage bonds, which provide
banks with an alternative tool to raise funds earmarked for housing
loans. In addition, in most European countries the state has been
providing a limited amount of housing loans directly, by establishing
public funds to promote housing construction and finance. While Croatia
has developed two such schemes, it is not clear that one of them (the
POS scheme) is well targeted.</p>
      <p>
        In Section 4 it was argued that the character of Croatia’s tourism
is not likely to change significantly with the growth of foreign
ownership of vacation homes. While some additional pressures on the
environment and local economies can be expected, they would not differ
qualitatively from the pressures that tourist resorts are already
experiencing with the robust growth of tourism in recent years. As for the
broader implications of EU accession on Croatia’s tourism industry,
these can be largely separated from the issue of increased foreign
ownership of vacation homes. Thus far there has been little EU intervention
in the field of tourism. Freedom of movement provisions, competition
law and other EU regulations have barely touched the tourism industry
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(Williams, 2001)</xref>
        . Most tourism regions in Croatia will have to face
choices about diversifying their source and product markets, imposing
stricter development controls and improving the quality of their tourism
product irrespective of accession to the EU. Given the ease of entry into
tourism, which is domina ted by fragmented indigenous capital, they
will also face greater competition from other southern European
destinations and the challenge of constantly adapting to new forms of
demand. Some resorts may decline as a result unless they are
reinvigorated by new investment and innovation. In this area, foreign
investment in real estate could play a very useful role.
      </p>
      <p>Regarding the macroeconomic effects of foreign investment in the
property sector, no one knows exactly how many foreigners may
eventually end up buying property in Croatia. Perhaps the share of secondary
residences owned by foreigners will never be as high as for instance the
50% share in Spain. In the case of Croatia, this would imply purchases of
some 100,000 vacation homes by foreigners, resulting in potential
inflows of 5 billion euros, or 20% of GDP. But as argued in Section 5,
even if foreigners purchase only a few thousand vacation homes, the
Annex
effects on the local and national economies would be sufficiently high to
warrant caution on the part of macroeconomic policy makers.</p>

      <title>Measuring the economic impact of tourism:</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-12">
      <title>Tourism Satellite Account</title>
      <p>Tourism plays a significant role in many economies in terms of
the production of goods and services and the creation of employment
opportunities. However, tourism remains difficult to define and
measure, and as a result the industry suffers from a credibility problem. In
the case of conventional industries such as agriculture or
manufacturing, the contribution of industry to GDP is measured from the supply
side, i.e., from the value of goods and services they produce. In the case
of tourism, this conventional approach covers mainly the output
provided by the hotel and restaurant industry, which is equivalent to only
about 3% of GDP in Croatia. Yet the contribution of tourism to GDP
goes far beyond this narrow definition, to other industries supplying
tourism output such as agriculture, fishing, the food industry,
construction, transportation, cultural establishments, etc.</p>
      <p>In the past, economists relied on estimates of income multipliers
to approximate indirect effects of tourism on domestic industries other
than hotels and restaurants.lii This methodology, however, is unreliable
as it is based on many ad hoc assumptions. In contrast, TSA recast the
national accounts so as to identify the diverse products and services that
are delivered to domestic and foreign visitors. On the demand side,
TSA include two basic aggregates:
• Travel and tourism consumption, which includes four components: (i)
the value of products and services consumed by domestic and
international visitors for personal travel and tourism; (ii) business travel by
government and industry; (iii) expenditure by individual government
agencies and departments that specialise in visitor services (cultural
and recreational establishments, immigration and customs, etc) and
(iv) spending by international visitors on goods and services
(socalled visitor exports).
• Travel and tourism demand, which estimates a broader,
economywide impact of tourism and includes three components: (i) public</p>
      <p>Page 221
spending on tourism promotion, aviation administration, security and
similar services made on behalf of the community at large but
closely associated with tourism (so-called collective government
expenditure); (ii) capital investments to provide facilities, equipment and
infrastructure to visitors and (iii) goods and capital sent abroad for
ultimate sale to visitors or use by providers of travel and tourism
services (so-called non-visitor exports).</p>
      <p>On the supply side, TSA also produce two different aggregates:
the travel and tourism industry and the travel and tourism economy.
The former captures only the direct impact of travel and tourism for
comparison with conventional industries such as manufacturing. The
latter captures the broader, indirect, or economy-wide impact of travel
and tourism. The TSA show separately the portion of travel and tourism
supply that is imported (including expenditure on outbound travel by
domestic residents), and also calculate direct and indirect components
of value added produced by travel and tourism industry. Finally, the
TSA show employment for travel and tourism industry and travel and
tourism economy.

The lengthy approval procedure is perhaps more a reflection of red tape in various
ministries and local governments involved (on this, see World Bank, 2004) than of
the strictness of regulations per se.</p>
      <p>Properties acquired by residents of Slovenia before the split of the former
Yugoslavia are not affected by this regulation. Many vacation homes owned by
residents of other former Yugoslav republics before 1991 have been sold in the
meantime. However, the status of many resort properties and much commercial real
estate owned by companies from the former republics is still unresolved (see
Nacional, 22 June 2004 [www.nacional.hr]).</p>

Dalmacija (26 August 2004) and Novi list (13 September 2004; www.novilist.hr),
approval to buy property has been given to only 36% of applicants, which is closer
to the subsequently reported official figures shown in Table 1.</p>

viii Property speculation is usually defined as the holding of unimproved or
underimproved property for the purpose of reselling profitably without any substantial
capital investment. Local authorities in Croatia currently impose a tax on unused
land for construction and commercial property; however, the tax rate is fairly low
(up to a maximum of 15 kuna, or 2 euros, per square meter), and unused
residential property is not taxed
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref23">(see Kesner-Škreb and Kuliš, 2001)</xref>
        .
ix The Croatian tax authorities define capital gains on property sales as the
difference between the sale price and the purchase price of property adjusted for the
producer price index of industrial products
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref17 ref29 ref3 ref32 ref33 ref35 ref7 ref8">(see Law on the income tax, NN
127/2000, 150/2002 and 163/2003, paragraph 23)</xref>
        . In other words, any increase in
the value of property due to producer price inflation is not taxed.

replied: “It’s really easy: the first few months your entire salary goes to repay the
loan, and after a year or so the monthly payment costs the same as a bottle of
wine”.
xxxviii One should recognize at the same time that the current older generation is
worseoff in terms of health care costs, which were fully subsidized during socialism but
are now increasingly borne fully by the patients.
xxxix Another useful study is the tourism development strategy elaborated by the
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">IZTZG
(2003)</xref>
        .
xl These figures are adjusted for the latest data on GDP and employment in 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
        The World Travel and Tourism Council (2004) used preliminary estimates of
these series. On this basis, the contribution of travel and tourism in 2003 was
estimated at 22.4% of GDP and 27.4% of total employment.
xli Estimates of price elasticities of demand by tourists from western Europe and the
United States for holidays in Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Turkey range
from –0.3 to –3.2. That is, a 1% increase in the price of a package holiday in
country A will reduce the demand for vacation in that country by western
European and US visitors by up to 3.2%
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(see Syrioupoulos and Sinclair, 1993)</xref>
        .
xlii It is interesting to note that social science researchers (including in Croatia) have
shown considerable interest in sustainable tourism
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33 ref34 ref5 ref8">(see for instance Cariae, 2003;
Creaco and Querini, 2003; Petriae, 2003; and Petrin, 2004)</xref>
        , but very little
interest in analytical work on the economics of tourism.
xliii Average income elasticity of demand for holidays in Italy is estimated at around
2.0; in Greece and Turkey 1.8; Portugal 2.5; and in Spain 1.5. That is, a 1%
decrease in income of western European visitors is associated with a 2.5%
decrease in demand for holiday travel to Portugal (see Syrioupoulos, 1995).
xliv See for instance Scottish Parliament Information Centre (2002).

xlviii In the spring of 2004, a total of 185 properties were demolished (Vjesnik, 11
September 2004). The problem is even more pronounced in Albania: in January
2003 the government said only 500 of the 3,000 buildings on the 450 km coast
were legal. It has since destroyed 1,000 and recently announced it would raze
further 300 illegally built hotels and restaurants (International Herald Tribune, 23
September 2004).

        ).
li For instance, Spain’s 65 hotel groups own some 30% of hotel capacity (the rest are
mostly small family-owned hotels). But only one-quarter of hotel groups have any
foreign capital, and in only half of these groups does foreign participation exceed
50% of capital
