      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        In qualitative studies, researchers often rely on retrospective data collection
methodologies to investigate people's experiences. When the inquiry involves
sensitive issues and requires participants to voice descriptive and emotional
stories, the use of appropriately sensitive data gathering methodologies is
imperative
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(GUENETTE &amp; MARSHALL, 2009)</xref>
        . In this article we describe the
utility of using a retrospective data collection tool called the lifegrid (LG) in
exploring adolescent substance abuse from the perspective of mothers and their
substance abusing adolescent children (hereafter referred to adolescents). [1]
We decided to use the LG approach to complement the case-study research
methodology as it has proved useful in previous studies in engaging with
participants, supporting them to talk about their experiences and collecting
retrospective information (WILSON, CUNNINGHAM-BURLEY, BANCROFT,
BACKETT-MILBURN &amp; MASTERS, 2007). In addition, parents' lives and
parentadolescent relationships are profoundly impacted by adolescent substance abuse
given the various psychosocial and economic stresses associated with
adolescent substance abuse
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref4">(see for example JACKSON &amp; MANNIX, 2003;
JACKSON, USHER &amp; O'BRIEN, 2007; USHER, JACKSON &amp; O'BRIEN, 2007;
WEGNER, AREND, BASSADIEN, BISMATH &amp; CROS, 2014)</xref>
        . In light of this we
surmised that the trauma that adolescents and parents may have experienced
could influence the kind of information they are willing to recall. In order to
facilitate recall of these events we thought to use a data collection tool that will
lend itself to recall and discussion of sensitive events. [2]
In the following sections we provide an overview of the LG and the methodology
of our study. We will then discuss our findings in relation to the usefulness of the
LG. Finally we outline some of the practical challenges we faced in using the LG
and provide some ideas on how to overcome these challenges. [3]
The LG is a tool used to construct a visual chronological framework of a person's
life (RICHARDSON, ONG, SIM &amp; CORBETT, 2009; WILSON et al., 2007). It
generally takes a chart-like structure with several rows and columns, where the
rows usually represent the person's life in years (each row is a particular year)
and the columns represent significant life events (WILSON et al., 2007). The
significant life events are selected aspects of the participants' lives that the
researcher wishes to explore. These aspects are closely related to the research
questions of the study and can include topics such as family life, friends and
social relationships, place of residence, occupation and so forth. For example, the
LG was used to explore the life course of cancer patients using selected aspects
such as "personal life events," "education, lifestyle," "residence," "occupation"
and "other" (NOVOGRADEC, 2009, p.2). A completed LG then allows the
researcher to assess how the participant's life has changed over a certain period
of time and when these changes occurred. When the LG is used to facilitate
qualitative data gathering, it further allows the researchers to unpack how the
participants experienced and managed these changes. [4]
The lifegrid tool was developed to address research concerns related to
participant recall and validity in retrospective medical studies (BELL, 2005). It has
traditionally been used to collect quantitative data on the development of
illnesses, pain and health behaviors (BERNEY &amp; BLANE, 1997; PARRY,
THOMSON &amp; FOWKES, 1999; RICHARDSON et al., 2009). The core focus of
the earlier studies (see BERNEY &amp; BLANE, 1997; BLANE, 1996) was to use the
LG to improve the accuracy of the recalled information (BELL, 2005). BERNEY
and BLANE's (1997) study assessed the accuracy of older participants' recall of
events that stretched over 50 years prior to the interview. The events they
focused on were "external" events like wars and strikes, "family" events such as
births and marriages, residential events and occupational events (ibid.). When
compared to the historical records of the participants, the findings indicated that
residential and occupational information, like fathers' occupation or residential
address, was recalled with more accuracy than detailed information on childhood
illnesses and dietary requirements (ibid.). [5]
Recent studies suggest that the potential of the LG extends beyond collecting
quantitative data and improving recall accuracy. Research by BELL (2005),
HARRISON, VEECK and GENTRY (2011), NOVOGRADEC (2009) and WILSON
et al. (2007) show the usefulness of the LG to facilitate participant engagement in
qualitative interviews. BELL (2005, p.53) however warns that while the LG may
improve the quality of the data collected, it could also restrict "the extent to which
interviewees feel able to discuss events not covered by the life-grid." In our study,
the LG was therefore used to compliment the semi-structured individual
interviews conducted with the participants and support them to talk about their
experiences. [6]

      <title>3. Methodology</title>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>3.1 Summary of formative work</title>
        <p>The LG approach was piloted on one mother and her adolescent son who had
been admitted to a substance abuse treatment center for cannabis abuse (n=2).
The aim of the pilot was to determine how, and in what time sequence, we
needed to conduct the LG interview with the study participants. Additionally, we
were interested in identifying some of the initial significant life event categories
that we could include on the LG table for the overall study. Once identified, these
categories were included on the LG table as examples of significant events and
additional category options were provided should the participants identify other
significant events. [7]
Both the mother and the adolescent were interviewed at their home on three
occasions over a period of one month. The first interview was structured to build
rapport between the researcher and the participant and included questions about
the participant's family, school or work background, social relationships and
relationship with each other (parent-child relationship). Given that we wanted to
use the LG during the second interview, we also included questions that focused
on when certain experiences occurred and when relationships changed. For
example we asked the mother: "When do you think your son started using
drugs?" and "When did you start noticing a change in your relationship with your
son?" [8]</p>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-1">
          <title>3.1.1 Pilot interview with mother participant: Outcomes</title>
          <p>Following the first interview with the mother, the interviewer (first author) partially
filled in the LG with some of the information that was gathered during the first
interview. The partially completed LG was then co-completed during the second
interview. In this case, the mother indicated that she would like the interviewer to
continue filling in the grid on her behalf as she did not want to do the actual
writing but was comfortable to do the activity. [9]
The second interview with the mother commenced with a recap of the LG. This
helped ensure that the mother was primed to discuss her experiences in greater
depth using the partially completed LG as a guide. The LG approach proved to be
useful during this interview both as a means to document information chronologically,
and facilitating the recall of events and experiences. It is our experience that the
LG was well received, appeared to be easily understood by the mother, and
allowed us to ask sensitive questions (described in the findings). [10]</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-2">
          <title>3.1.2 Pilot interview with adolescent participant: Outcomes</title>
          <p>The pilot continued with the adolescent participant. Given the favorable outcomes
of the interviews with the mother, we decided to incorporate the LG during the
first interview with the adolescent to determine how he will respond to a blank LG.
The same processes were followed as with the mother: the LG was introduced
and explained to the adolescent and was then co-completed. This approach was
found to be acceptable because, as in the case of his mother, the LG appeared
to have been understood and easy to co-complete. Practically, using the LG in
this way also allowed the interviewer to check and therefore capture the
information more accurately without having to correct it in a next interview. The
findings section of this article will provide a more detailed account of the
usefulness of the LG in facilitating participant recall, discussing sensitive topics,
and cross checking and validating participant information. [11]</p>

      <sec id="sec-3-2">
        <title>3.2 Study participants</title>
        <p>Given the various challenges associated with the accuracy of participant recall in
retrospective studies, researchers have since argued that the inclusion of
collateral informants are useful for increasing confidence (some would say
reliability) in subject self-report (AMODEO &amp; GRIFFIN, 2009). We therefore
interviewed five parent-adolescent pairs, each consisting of one mother and her
adolescent who had been admitted to a substance abuse treatment center.
Discussions centered on issues pertaining to the development of the adolescent
substance abuse, experiences of parenting an adolescent substance abuser and
being an adolescent substance abuser (respectively) and the strategies parents
employed to cope with the adolescent's substance abuse. We were interested in
the participants' current experiences and feelings associated with the
adolescent's substance abuse, as well as their recollections of the past and how
this might have contributed to the way they currently feel. [12]
Each participant was interviewed once using the LG method and the information
gathered during the LG interview was discussed in greater detail. Where needed,
each participant's LG was used to facilitate these additional discussions.
Scheduling of the interviews was also dependent on the availability of the
participants. The mothers and adolescents were interviewed separately and
confidentiality was strictly adhered to. This meant that none of the information
discussed with the mother was shared with the child and vice versa. Separate
interview schedules were developed for the mothers and adolescents, although
questions pertaining to the development of the adolescent's substance abuse,
parent-adolescent relationships, and parental coping strategies for the
adolescent's substance abuse formed part of both the interview schedules. This
data formed the basis of interviews on the second occasion using the LG. [13]</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-3">
        <title>3.3 Study processes</title>
        <p>Following BELL (2005) and WILSON et al.'s (2007) examples, an A3 landscape
sheet of paper to map the interview with the mothers and their adolescents
children was used. The adolescents' LG comprised eleven columns by roughly 30
rows, depending on the age of the participant. The mothers' LG was eleven
columns by about 50 rows. Extra rows were provided in order to have enough
space should there be more than one significant event per year to document. In
using the LG we were interested in when significant events occurred and how the
participants experienced these significant events. We considered events
significant when they provided us with information on the development of the
child's substance abuse, the effects of the child's substance abuse on his/her
well-being, and the effects of the child's substance abuse on the mother and the
family as a whole. For example, one of the questions we asked the mothers was:
"when did you first become aware of your child's substance abuse?" with follow
up questions such as "tell me about how you felt when your child told you that he
was using drugs?," "when did you start feeling this way," and "how did you deal
with it (a particular challenge)? [14]
The participants generally requested that the interviewer complete the LG.
Although this was not planned, it ensured that "completing the grid did not
interrupt the flow of the interview" (BELL, 2005, p.56). Participants were then able
to engage with the questions and provide responses without being concerned
about issues such as spelling and whether they are doing it right. [15]
Given that a blank lifegrid could prove to be daunting to participants with complex
narratives (WILSON et al., 2007), we decided to introduce the participants to the
LG in the first interview indicating that we would return to it during the course of
our meetings. The interviewer explained that the LG will be used during the
interview to document particular issues as they emerge. It was also made clear
that there is no right or wrong answers and that the information that will be written
is fully dependent on what will be discussed during the interview. Lastly, it was
made clear to participants that their respective LGs will not be shown to one
another as to ensure that confidentiality is respected. [16]</p>

      <title>4. Findings</title>
      <p>Drawing on extracts from our interviews, this section will discuss our findings on
the usefulness of the LG in relation to the following themes: Building rapport,
Enhancing depth and range of recall and Cross-referencing and comparing of
events. Each of these themes will be discussed in turn followed by a discussion
on some of the challenges that we encountered and how we resolved these. [17]
In this article, our interpretations of the themes are illustrated using extracts. In
these quotations, square brackets contain material provided by us for
clarification. Ellipsis points "(...)" indicate that the participants' thoughts have
trailed off and uppercase letters are used to illustrate emphasis. A pause is
illustrated by "(.)" and interruptions are indicated by "=." [18]</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>4.1 Building rapport</title>
        <p>
          We found the LG useful to establish interviewer-participant rapport and "breaking
the ice"
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(WILSON et al., 2007, p.140; see also HARRISON et al., 2011, and
PARRY et al., 1999)</xref>
          . Following general introductory questions such as "tell me
about yourself," the interviewer used probing questions focusing on where and
when the participants were born, where they are currently residing, residential
movements, academic performance (for adolescents) and occupation (for adults).
The interviewer wrote this information onto the LG and the participant checked to
see if it was documented accurately. In line with findings presented by
HARRISON et al. (2011, p.221) the co-completion of the LG facilitated the
interviewer-participant relationship as it could be perceived as "a team working
together to complete a common task, much like two strangers collaborating to
complete a jigsaw puzzle." WILSON et al. (2007) add that the practical
completion of the LG averts the need for continuous eye contact which can
further put participants at ease, especially when sensitive issues are discussed
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(also see HARRISON et al., 2011)</xref>
          . Additionally, SHERIDAN, CHAMBERLAIN
and DUPUIS (2011) indicates that in using graphic elicitation methods like the
LG, the interviewer and participant reciprocally engage in the research which
could encourage the participant to become aware of his/her own agency
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(see
also KESBY, 2000)</xref>
          . [19]

      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>4.2 Enhancing depth and range of recall</title>
        <p>The LG proved an effective approach in encouraging participants to provide
detailed accounts of their experiences. While the LG was initially completed in a
chronological fashion using the biographical information, it was flexible enough to
allow participants to move between significant events when discussing their
experiences.
"Researcher: Is that when you went to formal school like big school? Cause that's
when you went to grade
Interviewee: grade 1.</p>
        <p>Researcher: Uhm, did anything big happen for you during that time? Did anything
happen at home, with your family?
Interviewee: [silence] no. I am confused now. I forget in here that my granny died!
Researcher: Oh the year your granny died?
Interviewee: Yes
Researcher: So your granny died somewhere?
Researcher: How old do you think you were?</p>
        <p>Interviewee: Eight or nine that time" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [20]
Similarly, Abigail, a 16 year old girl who had been referred to the treatment center
for her harmful alcohol use, was able to control the discussion and talk about her
experiences as she remembered them. In this way she was not restricted by a
rigidly structured interview approach which may have prevented her from sharing
her story as openly as she has. In telling the interviewer about her drinking
patterns she is reminded of a particular event that she considers significant that
had occurred in the previous year, but had forgotten to tell the interviewer about it.
"Researcher: Okay I see, so then tell me about the next time you drank again.
Interviewee: Yah, after exams, HEY! I forgot something, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Now we
are going very back!
Researcher: Oh Glory! Reverse. Let's go back. Are we going back to last year?
Interviewee: Our last paper, me and my friends were at [a park]. So we buy [vodka],
we buy a six-pack, a six-pack of [ciders]. Yah those are the 3 things we bought and
we go chill at the park.</p>
        <p>Researcher: How many of you were there?
Interviewee: Five.</p>
        <p>
          Researcher: You were five with a bottle of [Vodka], a six-pack of [ciders]
Interviewee: No a six-pack of [a particular brand of ciders] and a six-pack of [another
particular brand of ciders]. And we drink the six-packs first. Okay Jess, one of my
friends, she didn't drink much. She only drank the six-pack she didn't drink the
Vodka. So we decided okay lets drink the Vodka. Now we in [the park] the worst
place to [be]! Anyway we didn't think of that at the time. So we drinking and uhm
[Laughter]
Researcher: Oh goodness, what did you do?
Interviewee: No, I didn't do anything wrong, I just passed out and the police van came
to fetch me and parents were called" (Abigail, 16 year old, alcohol abuser). [21]
This flexibility of the LG is apparent in the way that it allowed the conversation to
go back and forth between dates and/or significant events. This was useful as
associated events trigger memories that might not have been remembered. This
further allowed the interviewer and participant to document particular events and
discuss them in detail later in the interview or in a follow-up interview. This is
particularly important for sensitive research such as the current study as it allows
the participants the space to pause or return to certain issues when they are
ready to discuss those (WILSON et al., 2007). This was also a key finding in
timeline research conducted by SHERIDAN et al. (2011) on fatness and weight
loss. In this way, the LG also acts as a reminder to the interviewer about the
significant issues s/he wishes to discuss in detail which "provides direction to the
interview when needed
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(HARRISON et al., 2011, p.222)</xref>
          . For example in the first
extract below, Winston talks about the supportive and comforting relationship he
felt he had with his cousin before his drug abuse. This conversation soon turned
very emotional for him and the interviewer decided to change the focus of that
discussion and asked him to comment on the support he received at the
treatment center.
        </p>
        <p>"Researcher: So is that = what did you feel that time?
Interviewee: I felt like I never wanted to talk about it. But you see me and my small
cousin we use to talk about it.</p>
        <p>Researcher: =Yeah
Interviewee: = we use to talk about our stories cause me and him we almost like the
same you see [emotional]
Researcher: I see, so how much younger is than you?
Interviewee: He's in grade 9 now.</p>
        <p>Researcher: So you guys are, almost ... you close [in age]
Interviewee: Yeah we close [crying]
Researcher: So you had someone that you could speak to but it was a younger
cousin?</p>
        <p>Researcher: Is that why you actually enjoyed being at [treatment center] because you
had that space to=</p>
        <p>Interviewee: =talk to someone yeah" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [22]
Later in the conversation, the interviewer was able to ask Winston about his
relationship with cousin again.</p>
        <p>"Interviewee: I never use to feel it [abusing cannabis] was wrong.</p>
        <p>Researcher: Never felt it was wrong while you were smoking?
Interviewee: No
Researcher: But you felt it was wrong when other people, when this boy was with
you?
Interviewee: Yeah, only when my cousin was with me.</p>
        <p>Researcher: So why is that? Why do you think you felt?
Interviewee: No, because I felt, I know me and him were going through the same
thing. Now I don't want him to be like me! So I was trying to show him that there= no
I'm not in bad stuff and you mustn't do that there!
Researcher: Yeah, so you feel that you wanted to be a role model for him?
Researcher: [pause] so this seems to be like difficult for you again, to speak about,
especially this particular topic.</p>
        <p>Interviewee: I don't know, because when I was drinking ... I never want to show him
that I was still at it, I wanted to show him the good way, but I was still at it.
Researcher: And then talking about it now, makes you feel ...</p>
        <p>Interviewee: Makes me feel bad" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [23]
Furthermore, while some researchers might argue that the information collected
in LG interviews can be elicited in conventional questioning, we found the LG
useful in encouraging the participants to tell their stories in a less confronting and
more innovative way (SHERIDAN et al., 2011; WILSON et al., 2007). WILSON et
al. (2007) point out that conventional interviewing have the potential to be boring
and repetitive. The LG, they argue, was useful in their work to discuss sensitive
issues without confronting participants with a long list of personal questions
(ibid.). SHERIDAN et al. (2011) further add that timeline interviews can represent
an "aide-memoire, focusing attention beyond what is possible through talk alone,
thus becoming not only a piece of data in its own right but a vehicle through
which further data were produced" (p.554). In this regard, it is our experience that
the LG itself represented the lives of the participants during the interviews in such
a way that it became the object of discussion rather than the parents'
experiences. This physical focus on the LG might have encouraged the
participants to tell their stories more openly as they are perhaps indirectly
reflecting on their lives, emotions and experiences through the LG. [24]</p>

      <sec id="sec-4-3">
        <title>4.3 Cross-referencing and comparing events</title>
        <p>
          The LG is usually completed by one participant at a time
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(see for example
BERNEY &amp; BLANE, 2003; HARRISON et al., 2011; NOVOGRADEC, 2009;
RICHARDSON et al., 2009; WILSON et al., 2007)</xref>
          , although studies have used
the LG with couples who completed it together (BELL, 2005). We used the LG
with adolescent-parent pairs in which the adolescents and parents completed
separate LGs. This allowed us to compare the adolescent and parent's accounts
of similar events. In instances where the adolescent or the mother neglect to
discuss a significant event (like parents' divorce, death, admission to substance
abuse treatment centers, etc.) the interviewer was able to pick this up and
discuss it with the other. This was at times a challenging activity as it required the
interviewer to probe for significant events that were not mentioned without making
the participant aware that she received this information from either the mother or
child (bridging confidentiality). The extract below highlights the complexity, and
usefulness, of cross-referencing in our study. Jacky, who is the mother of
Winston, told the interviewer on a previous occasion that during his drug abuse
Winston had left home for a while to stay with his brother. For us this was
significant as his brother was a cocaine user at that time and we were interested
in whether living with his brother encouraged his drug use.
        </p>
        <p>"Researcher: Okay. And you were still with your mommy during that year you never
moved anywhere, or visit anybody?
Interviewee: No.</p>
        <p>Researcher: Going to visit to?
Interviewee: I don't, only use to go visit my family there, the ones the ones that are in
[place], yeah only them
Researcher: And how [were] things with your brother during this time
Interviewee: My brother, he never use to stay here
Researcher: Here, but did you see him at all?
Interviewee: Yeah, he used to come see us.</p>
        <p>Researcher: Yeah, and did go visit him at all?
Interviewee: Yeah I use to go visit him cause I use to see his son, cause his son
always, his son just use to like me ...</p>
        <p>Researcher: Yeah
Interviewee: Yeah use to visit his son.</p>
        <p>Researcher: That so cute ...</p>
        <p>Interviewee: Then I use to visit his son.</p>
        <p>Researcher: Big uncle ... so but you never, you just went visit him but you never use
to stay there or anything
Interviewee: I use to stay there but I use to come back home yeah.</p>
        <p>Researcher: You came back home. So how long did you used to stay there?
Interviewee: It's about 3 months" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [25]
In a similar instance, Margaret, the mother of Abigail, indicated that she only
became aware that Abigail had used alcohol hazardously once she was caught
drinking at school and consequently referred to the treatment center. However,
Abigail's narrative reads differently and indicates that her mother had been aware
of her prior drinking habits. She explained that after she had gone drinking with
her friends in the park, she consumed so much alcohol that she "was knocked
out. I don't know what happened! The police came [and] parents were called."
"Researcher: So they call the parents to come get the children, so your mother
comes in and what does she do?
Interviewee: My mother was in the car and my guardian that comes to stay here
kicked and slapped me to wake me up, but I wouldn't wake up.</p>
        <p>Researcher: You wouldn't wake up?
Interviewee: No, and they got me into the car. They got me home, I had a bath, and I
woke up the following morning, not feeling so good.</p>
        <p>Researcher: And what happened with you and your mom?
Interviewee: She was quite angry with me. Very, very angry with me. That's when she
realized that I=
Researcher: You drink?
Interviewee: I drink, but then she thought I stopped, not knowing that I didn't actually.
And yes she was angry with me for a few days but then after me apologizing and
saying 'I'm sorry I didn't mean to disappoint you' she forgave me.</p>
        <p>
          Researcher: Yes, but were you sorry?
Interviewee: Yes I was sorry. That was an embarrassment" (Abigail, 16 year old,
alcohol abuser). [26]
One possible reason why Abigail's mother did not tell the interviewer about this
occasion was that she, like Abigail, might have been too embarrassed by
Abigail's behavior. What this finding highlights is the significance of
crossreferencing and the usefulness of the LG interview in facilitating this process. In
the same way the LG allowed us to identify the silences in the participant pairs'
accounts; i.e. what the mothers identify as significant compared to what the child
does not (and vice versa). Moreover, the LG allowed for a visual
crossreferencing of life events where the interviewer was able to probe for the
participant's perception of the interrelatedness of certain life events
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(HARRISON
et al., 2011)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>"Researcher: Okay.</p>
        <p>Interviewee: I was living at my mother's home.</p>
        <p>Researcher: Oh I see. Were your mother and father still together?
Interviewee: Yeah
Researcher: But he [father] was at the farm and you were this side?
Interviewee: Yes and then when they get married that time I was starting to use drug
Researcher: I see ... Oh I see when they got married?
Interviewee: Yes.</p>
        <p>Researcher: Do you think that there's, is there ... okay ... so why-why is, why during
that time when they got married that you started using drugs?
Interviewee: Hmm (.) mam I didn't start= it didn't really start when they married. I
started when they ... after [they got] married.</p>
        <p>Researcher: After marriage?
Interviewee: No" (Ben, 15 years, whoonga1 user). [27]</p>
        <p>Researcher: Okay. And did it have anything to do with the fact that they got married?

low grade heroine and other hazardous additives like rat poison

This reflection offered us further insights that extend beyond simply reviewing the
time-related associations between the life-events, which could be misinterpreted.
For example, should this cross-referencing not have taken place, the researchers
could have assumed an association between Ben's drug use and his parents'
marriage. [28]</p>

      <title>5. Practical Challenges and Possible Solutions</title>
      <p>
        We found the LG to be a flexible research tool that is useful in enhancing our
understanding of participant's experiences by facilitating discussion, building
rapport and allowing cross-referencing of life events and comparisons between
participants' accounts. However the LG approach is not without limitations. One
limitation of retrospective research in general is related to the accuracy and
reliability of the information provided by the participants. HARRISON et al. (2011)
propose that "we have no way of evaluating to what extent the memories
approximated a true rendering of the experiences of these participants" (p.223).
RICHARDSON et al. (2009) have also commented on this debate between
realism and constructionism and has argued for a middle-ground or pragmatic
perspective. RICHARDSON et al. (ibid.) suggest that recall and reconstruction
are interrelated concepts and that in qualitative research, the accuracy of the
recalled information is less important than meaning and experience. In our study
we were not only interested in when life events occurred, but also the subjective
experiences and meanings of these life events, and how these events influenced
and changed the lives of the participants. Given our focus on experiences (and
with concerns pertaining to recall in the back of our minds) we decided to
interview the mothers and adolescents while the adolescent was completing
his/her treatment at the rehabilitation centers. It is our experience that this
facilitated recall as the participants were reflecting on current and fairly recent
experiences. [29]
Furthermore researching sensitive issues, like those discussed in our study, is a
challenging task which required us to identify methodologies that are
appropriately sensitive while at the same time facilitative. Using the literature as
our guide
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(see for example BUTLER &amp; BAULD, 2005; USHER et al., 2007)</xref>
        , we
understood that talking about the adolescent's substance abuse would be a
difficult task for both the mothers and the adolescents (especially to a "stranger").
In this regard, we were cognizant of the possibility of selective recall where
participants are unable (or perhaps unwilling) to recall certain events, or show
selective recall bias in favor of what is "easier" to discuss. Studies show that
individuals have the tendency to forget information that they perceive
selfthreatening (for full discussions on these issues, please refer to GREEN,
SEDIKIDES &amp; GREGG, 2007; SAUNDERS, 2012). We therefore recognized that
participant recall, which was essential to obtain data that is information rich in our
study, was intrinsically dependent on our participants' abilities and willingness to
tell their stories. As put forth by BROWN and REAVY (2014) recall operates as a
shared activity and in our study the LG acted as a quasi-neutral stimulus to the
participants memories that accommodated the complexities of recall and
facilitated discussions in a non-threatening and sensitive way and extended the
study beyond the traditional 1:1 interview. [30]
Some of the practical challenges (and solutions) we encountered with the LG are
also important to note here. Initially, the interviewer used a semi-structured
interview guide that posed questions chronologically which, as discussed earlier,
did not appropriately lend itself to the conversational and the non-linear way in
which the participants recalled their experiences. It is our experience that a
formative phase helps allay anxieties about the tool, but also serves to prime the
participant in identifying key questions and life events categories, such as
relationships, school, work etc. that will be discussed in the LG interview. It might
also be useful to identify possible life-events from the literature and incorporate
these in the LG interview. In some instances the participants thought that the LG
was a way for the interviewer to document aspects of the participants' lives rather
than an activity to be co-completed by the participants and the interviewer. Once
this was brought to the attention of the interviewer, she was able to explain in as
much detail as needed that the LG is way to facilitate discussions. It is therefore
useful for researchers to introduce the LG in such a way that the participants are
not distracted by the notion of providing the "right answer" but are comfortable to
discuss their experiences. [31]
When using the LG with participant pairs (collateral informants) it is important for
researchers to be careful not to "take sides" when cross-referencing and
comparing events. In our study we respected that the participants' accounts
reflected their subjective experiences and perspectives. We certainly recognized
the significance of the participants' silences and selective recall as it tells us
something about the significance of particular experiences. In cross-referencing
or comparing events between the participant pairs we were less interested in
whose accounts were "right" or "wrong." Rather we found the LG useful in that it
allowed us to use relevant information obtained from one participant (f.e., the
adolescent) to probe for more detail from the other participant (f.e., the parent).
This afforded us an opportunity to gain a more informed understanding of the
participants' experiences and perspectives. [32]
A further challenge relates to simultaneously conducting and analyzing the LG
interviews. Given the fluidity of the participants' conversations, it is important for
the interviewer to continually verbally note the dates (in days, months or years)
that they are referring to when discussing the life events during the interview. In
our study for example, the interviewer sometimes neglected to record time and
date sequences which may conflate events in the coding of the transcripts. This is
especially imperative for researchers who are interested in tracking changes in
life-events and experiences. [33]

      <title>6. Conclusion</title>
      <p>This article describes the utility of the LG in qualitative inquiries. We found the LG
approach useful in helping explore the breadth and depth of events as we were
not only interested in when significant events occurred but also the participants'
experiences of, and changes in, these selected areas of their lives. While the LG
worked well in our study, it is advisable that researchers conduct a formative
phase to establish key questions and life event categories so as to ensure that
their research questions are appropriately addressed. The LG as a tool and
approach will be particularly valuable to qualitative researchers who are
interested in retrospectively exploring sensitive emotional events in the
development of adolescent risk behaviors. [34]</p>
