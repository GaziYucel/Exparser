national databases.</p>
      <p>Results The main factors for limited transferability of
health economic findings were found in country-specific
differences in resource consumption and the resulting costs.
These differences are affected by a number of influencing
cofactors (demography, epidemiology and individual
patient’s factors) and the overall health care system
structures (e.g. payment systems, health provider incentives).
However, despite the limitations country-specific health
economic assessments could be realised using the pooled/
split analyses approach, some statistical approaches and
modelling approaches.</p>
      <p>Conclusion A variety of methods for identifying and
adjusting country-specific differences in costs, effects and
cost-effectiveness was established during the past decades.
Multinational studies will continue to play a crucial role in
the evaluation of cost-effectiveness at national levels. It
seems likely that the growing interest in multinational
studies will lead to continued developments in adaptation
methods.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>
        The results of health economic evaluations are of growing
interest to political decision makers and insurance
providers, not least because of increasingly tight budgets in the
health care sector. To meet this new interest, clinical trials
are increasingly taking into account resource and cost
parameters
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Drummond et al. 1997)</xref>
        . In Germany economic
aspects are becoming more important in the assessment of
new therapies. Moreover, numerous methodological
standards have been developed in recent years, which aim to
ensure that the results of clinical studies are less open to
bias. In addition, regulatory authorities tend to favour
designs in which at least a minority of subjects in trials
have been recruited in the host country, although they
remain generally content with the fact that only a minority
of subjects may actually be drawn from their country. Thus,
international multicentre study designs have become a key
component of clinical trial programmes
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Demol and
Weihrauch 1997)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Multinational studies have numerous advantages over
single-nation studies. In particular, the large geographical
areas involved allow investigators to recruit sizable numbers
of patients in a relatively short period of time, and the quality
of evidence may be improved by virtue of regional variations
in the patient mix
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref27 ref8">(Manca and Willan 2006; Sculpher et al.
2004; Drummond and Pang 2001)</xref>
        . Multinational studies also
have important caveats. Chief among these is the difficulty
of transferring study findings to the level of individual
national health care systems. After all, national decision
makers are primarily interested in the results a study would
have yielded if it had been conducted in their own
jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clinical trials are normally designed on the assumption
of a common treatment effect across different strata, for
example by centre or by country. It is well understood that
patient characteristics and thus the absolute effects of
treatment may vary between centres, and it is common to
use some form of stratified randomisation to ensure an
approximate balance of treatment and control subjects
within centres or regions. The analysis of clinical trials
usually involves some degree of examination of subgroups,
although the aim is normally to support the assumption that
there is a single treatment effect, and there is considerable
controversy when it becomes apparent that this assumption
may not be supported
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Reed et al. 2005)</xref>
        . The question of
transferability becomes very apparent, however, when we
consider economic parameters, for these—in contrast to
clinical outcomes—are subject to considerable
countryspecific variability
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref15 ref8">(Asplund et al. 2003; Jönsson and
Weinstein 1997; Drummond and Pang 2001)</xref>
        . Despite
recent efforts to develop methodological standards for
dealing with the resulting uncertainties, it is surprising to
see that economic analyses are still being conducted
without paying consideration to the issues raised when
transferring the findings of multinational studies to national
settings
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Halliday and Darba 2003)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>According to the most recent German health care reform
act from April 2007, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency
in Health Care (IQWiG) can be assigned to evaluate not
only the effects of a medical intervention according to
international standards of evidence-based medicine, but
also the balance between benefits in the national health care
setting according to international standards of health
economics. In this context the question of transferring or
adopting the findings of multinational trials to an actual
national context will be a question of the methodological
framework the IQWiG is currently about to implement.</p>

      <title>Objectives</title>
      <p>The present analysis summarises several of the most
common international methods for generating health
economic assessments based on clinical studies from different
settings; it also provides an overview of potential new
approaches to this subject from the perspective of Germany.
In recent years, the problem of transferability has become
increasingly important in this country. These developments
raise the question of the extent to which the advantages of
multinational studies can be reconciled with the need for
unlimited transferability when adapting the findings of
these studies to a specific national context.</p>

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>A narrative literature review was performed to identify
potential reasons for limited transferability of results of
health economic evaluation from one country to another.
Although we used some relevant single search terms (e.g.
“transferability”) and search term combinations [e.g.
“transferability” AND “cost-benefit analysis (MeSH term)”], the
search procedure was not based on a systematic approach.
Based on these results, we further searched the
methodological literature for analytic approaches to handle the
restrictions. Additionally we described the possibility of
transferring foreign economic study results to the country
of interest by matching trial data with routine data from
national databases.</p>

        <p>
          The transferability of cost and effectiveness results obtained
in multinational studies to national contexts can be limited
by a large number of factors
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref3">(Bryan and Brown 1998;
Koopmanschap et al. 2001; Manca and Willan 2006)</xref>
          . Here,
it is important to keep in mind that problems related to
transferability affect primarily economic findings (e.g.
resources or costs). A number of authors have described
the sources of limited transferability
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref21 ref23 ref8 ref9">(Drummond and Pang
2001; Koopmanschap et al. 2001; O’Brien 1997; Pang
2002)</xref>
          ; some of these are briefly presented in the following
section:
        </p>
        <sec id="sec-5-1-1">
          <title>Differences in demography, epidemiology and individual patient characteristics</title>
          <p>
            It is well known that individual patient characteristics have
at least an indirect influence on the effectiveness and
costeffectiveness of any given intervention
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Kaplan and Keil
1993)</xref>
            . Examples include socioeconomic or demographic
factors, both of which may exhibit systematic
countryspecific differences in terms of their extent or degree. For
instance, it is conceivable that patients in one country may
show significant differences in educational attainment or
wealth compared to patients in the other countries taking
part in the same multinational study. This problem can be
addressed, where applicable, by defining strict inclusion
criteria
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Koopmanschap et al. 2001)</xref>
            . Patient-reported
outcomes are also subject to regional variations and thus may
also influence the evaluation of a treatment’s
costeffectiveness
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref9">(O’Brien 1997)</xref>
            . The same can be said for
regional differences in the incidence and prevalence of a
particular disease. For instance, high prevalence of a
disease in a certain country or region may lead to
downstream experience curve effects on the part of local
health care providers. In turn, high incidence of a disease
can increase the cost-effectiveness of a given
populationwide preventive measure
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Koopmanschap et al. 2001)</xref>
            . The
disease incidence and the level of patients’ comorbidities
will also be influenced by the age structure of a specific
country’s population
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Drummond and Pang 2001)</xref>
            .
          </p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-5-1-2">
          <title>Differences in country-specific health care and analysis structures</title>
          <p>
            Additional factors that can limit the transferability of study
results from one country to another can be traced to differences
in the design and organisation of health care systems. Examples
include differing systems of physician reimbursement and
related incentive schemes
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref8">(Koopmanschap et al. 2001;
Drummond and Pang 2001)</xref>
            as well as differences in pricing
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Drummond and Pang 2001)</xref>
            . In Germany, the method and
amount of physician reimbursement are based on consensus
agreements reached by the National Associations of Health
Insurance Funds and the National Associations of Social
Health Insurance-accredited Physicians. In contrast, the
remuneration of medical services in the USA is based on negotiated
contracts with health maintenance organisations (HMOs) or
other payers. For example, due to these differences, the US
hospital care section is associated with comparably higher
costs, which may lead to a higher utilisation in other health care
areas (e.g. community services) in order to avoid the high
hospitalisation expenditures
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Pang 2002)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            A striking example of the relevance of varying unit costs
may be the choice of a cost-effective clinical pathway for
patients with peptic ulcer disease and dyspepsia. These
conditions are known to be associated with Helicobacter
pylori infection, and eradication of this bacterium has been
shown to be an effective treatment strategy. H. pylori
infection can be diagnosed by means of endoscopy or, less
reliably, by non-invasive laboratory tests. The
costeffectiveness of initial diagnosis of H. pylori infection by
means of gastroscopy appears to be highly sensitive to the
unit cost of the endoscopic procedure, which is much
higher in the USA compared to European conventions
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref4">(Bytzer 1999; Moayyedi 2007)</xref>
            . As a consequence of this
difference in cost, a clinical management strategy starting
with initial endoscopy has been described as a
costeffective option in Europe, whereas in the USA empirical
antisecretory treatment or non-invasive H. pylori testing
were identified as preferable options based on their
costeffectiveness
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Bytzer 1999)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>Apart from unit costs, differences in country-specific
methods (upon which the economic evaluation is based)
could potentially influence the results of an economic
assessment. For example the cost-effectiveness perspective
could lead to different findings regarding the
costeffectiveness of a treatment. Was an analysis performed
out of a societal perspective including all indirect costs or
from the point of view of a single health care participant
(e.g. health insurance company)? Even if an analysis was
performed from the well-chosen perspective of interest, the
possibility for a single-country adaptation could be limited.
For example the economic evaluation results of a therapy
from the perspective of a social insurance system will be
deeply influenced by the structure of this system. Such a
social insurance system could include a health care
insurance, pension insurance, nursing insurance etc. or just
a part of these services.</p>
          <p>
            There are also country-specific differences in patient care
pathways, which are partly shaped by guidelines
established by national medical associations or differently
organised educational systems for health care professionals.
Further limits on transferability can result from differences
in the fundamental organisational principles of health care
systems (e.g. central vs decentralised planning). Other
potential problems when transferring the findings of
international studies to the national context can be
identified in a qualitative manner using checklists, such as
that provided in Table 1
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(based on Heyland et al. 1996)</xref>
            .
Approaches to the economic analysis of multinational
studies
In principle, there are various approaches to address the
question of heterogeneity of economic variables across
countries in multinational studies. All methodologies aim to
translate real study data to an individual country. Under the
reasonable assumption that internationally generated results
for the effectiveness of a treatment are less subject to
differences than cost results
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Drummond and Pang 2001)</xref>
            ,
the focus of the following observations is on the adaptation
of economic cost results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provided that data are both available and accessible, in
principal a bottom-up approach should be pursued where
individual data on resource consumption are the basis for both
individual cost calculation and a subsequent total cost
evaluation
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Hay and Jackson 1999)</xref>
            . This methodology has
the advantage that analysis of resource consumption can be
made directly on the basis of the direct cost sets of a specific
country. This approach, however, requires detailed individual
data.

          <title>Pooled/split analysis approach</title>
          <p>Based on this pattern, different sources can be identified to
analyse effectiveness and resource data within a
multinational study. In principle, different combinations are
conceivable which are shown in Fig. 2.</p>
          <p>A completely pooled analysis assumes that there are no
restrictions with regard to the adaptation of multinational study
results at the level of a specific country. Since this assumption is
not very likely as previously noted, the partially pooled,
respectively split analysis gains more relevance.</p>
          <p>With this approach only data of a certain country
selection (e.g. with comparable patient clientele and/or
health care systems) or a single country concerned are
selected for further evaluation. These methodologies are
easily comprehensible and thus a high transparency can be
achieved for the methods and presentation of results.</p>
          <p>
            However, a disadvantage of this approach is the reduced
sample size, which, in a fully split analysis, can reduce the
significance of the results
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref25 ref30">(Pinto et al. 2005; Reed et al. 2005)</xref>
            .
In any case, these analytic approaches are only feasible when
the country of interest was involved in the study. Figure 3
summarises the fundamental problems of pooled and split
analyses.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, there are often pooled/split analyses in which, on
the one hand, pooled effectiveness data of all participating
countries are taken into consideration, whereas, on the other
hand, only resource data of the country concerned are
considered. This approach is a trade-off between a
countrybased assignment of resources and a high statistical power
concerning the effectiveness data
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Reed et al. 2005)</xref>

            Since pooled/split analyses provide a compromise between
restriction-free transferability of the study results for a
certain country and a high statistical power, during the last
few years, statistical analyses have been developed to
approximate the optimal compromise. Among these,
regression-based approaches belong to the most frequently
common statistical methodologies. A potential
disadvantage of the statistical methods presented is, in part, the
complexity of the approach which involves again a reduced
transparency, and thus reduces the potential use as a
decision making aid

          <p>
            Hence, a study published by Koopmanschap et al.
recommends the use of multivariate regression analyses.
This is proposed in order to quantify and adjust
differences in resource consumption and costs in multinational
studies in a way such that the studies would have been
carried out in only one country
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Koopmanschap et al.

treatment samples and the associated consumption of
resources of the countries involved in order to form
homogeneous patient groups afterwards as precisely as
possible. For all groups of resources, statistically significant
and relevant country differences are determined, which are
then subject to further correction. For example if in a country
×% less laboratory tests are carried out (with consideration of
possible differences in the patient characteristics), the
number of laboratory tests of the patients of other
countries should be corrected downward by this factor ×.
The corrected resource utilisations are then multiplied by a
country-specific cost set.</p>
          <p>A second approach tries to identify a possible
countryspecific influence directly at a cost expense level. In a
multivariate regression analysis, the influence of different
covariates (beside the country of the study, e.g. the age of the
study participants and the disease status) on certain expenses is
examined. A limitation of the proceedings represented by
Koopmanschap et al. arises because of the isolated focus on
resources and/or expenses, with which possible
countryspecific effectiveness differences remain unconsidered.

            Other authors try to get around this limitation. In a
publication of
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Willke et al. (1998)</xref>
            the attempt is undertaken
to identify both country-specific differences in effectiveness
and the quantification of differences in resources and cost.
The statistical methodology assumes that a number of
exogenous variables (e.g. disease stage), therapy outcomes
as well as the interaction of country-specific treatment and
country-specific outcomes per se influence costs of a
treatment of an individual patient by treatment. The
proposal described by these authors considered also
country-specific outcome differences and thus partially
goes beyond existing recommendations [e.g. Ontario
Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Pharmaceutical
Products
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care
1994)</xref>
            ] for the adaptation of multinational studies, because
frequently only the consideration of possible
countryspecific cost and/or resource differences is required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides these statistical proposals, further statistical
approaches have been generated in recent years

          <title>Modelling of long-term costs and outcomes</title>
          <p>
            In many situations the use of decision analytic models is
preferred because it frequently occurs that there are no
patient-based data available from the participating centres
in the study or that the country of interest did not participate
in the study
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Drummond et al. 1997)</xref>
            . So-called modelling
studies enable the adaptation of treatment effects identified
at the study level to different populations and health care
systems. Often clinical studies are carried out without
accompanying collection of economic parameters. An
advantage, which the health economic modelling can offer,
is the possibility of using and combining data from different
sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example decision analytic models are nowadays
used to adjust study data to the real routine supply or to
transfer study results to a country which did not participate
in the study. An example of this approach is described in
the work of
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Menzin et al. (1996)</xref>
            . The authors use a
decision analytic model alongside the data of a phase III
study in the USA for adaptation to the European context
(France, Italy and Germany).
          </p>
          <p>
            A further type of application of decision analytic
models exists in the health economic analysis of clinical
studies, during which economic parameters were not
collected or were not available. Based on available study
information (e.g. characteristics of patient clientele,
clinical processes, event rates etc.) resulting resource
consumption is identified, on which basis a cost
evaluation of the study process could be performed. Via
extrapolation, an analysis of long-term costs of
interventions or savings due to prevention of events is
feasible
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Siebert 2003)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the IQWiG guidelines, the use of a
model for the economic evaluation of interventions must
be sufficiently justified
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Bastian et al. 2006)</xref>
            . In addition,
a model must meet numerous quality standards. Thus,
decision models must be described transparently and
comprehensibly and all assumptions must be explained.
Likewise, there is a demand for the implementation of
sensitivity analyses along with a fully probabilistic
approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, decision models should be subject to
validation. The mathematical computations must be
validated for their consistency with the model specifications,
and it must be guaranteed that model input data and the
outcomes are consistent with the available data. If different
models come to different statements on the same questions,
this identifies the necessity for a cross-validation of results
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Bastian et al. 2006)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            Provided that the appropriate quality criteria have been
considered, the methodology of current health economic
modelling is well established as a subsequent analysis of
study data
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(Sculpher et al. 2004)</xref>
            . Most international
guidelines accept modelling in health economic evaluation
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref26">(Hjelmgren et al. 2001; Schöffski and Graf von der
Schulenburg 2007)</xref>
            , although there remains some
scepticism regarding the appropriateness of different modelling
approaches, especially where these appear to translate
unimpressive clinical effects into highly cost-effective
outcomes.

          <title>Transfer of data to a national setting</title>
          <p>One approach which uses some elements of modelling
but adopts the efficacy of one single study of interest—
possibly the pivotal key study on which registration was
based—is to transfer data of a multinational trial to an
existing national data set. A key focus of this approach is
the linkage of patient data of the multinational study
with patient data from national data based on specific
patient characteristics (e.g. age, sex, insurance status,
ICD diagnoses etc.). An important prerequisite for the
practical implementation of the matching process is
therefore the existence of matching variables on the
patient level. If an international study delivers
patientlevel information only on sociodemography and therapy
effectiveness, economic data of comparable patients from
national databases can be assigned by means of patient
matching. Important, however, is the selection of relevant
matching variables such as age, sex, disease stages etc.
In a following step, differences of effectiveness between
the treatment arms are extracted and assessed according
to the national cost schedule (e.g. the group difference
concerning cardiac events in studies with cardiovascular
background).</p>
          <p>As a result, assessment of national cost-effectiveness can
be obtained by matching available patient characteristics
from the international trial with the national cost
components. A problem is that the fundamental goal of clinical
studies is the proof of the effectiveness of an intervention
under controlled conditions (efficacy). Therefore, the
collection of economic parameters in such studies is
often of less relevance. The matching process illustrated
so far would therefore only reflect the cost-effectiveness
at the time of the execution of the clinical study in the
country concerned (dependence on the related matching
database).</p>
          <p>A transfer of the cost-effectiveness results to the current
real life setting would be achieved by incorporating data
from national data sources (e.g. health insurance data). The
integration of data from automated databases or health
service research offers the potential to illustrate current
consumption of resources and/or the costs of treatment in
everyday life. Owing to specific characteristics of the
German health system, this approach could realise both
the adaptation to the national context and the consideration
of real health care conditions.</p>

        Inevitably, making decisions about the value of
pharmaceuticals in any context requires the combination
of data from different sources—this either can happen in
a qualitative way through expert judgement or can be
addressed by means of some form of modelling scenario.
Such economic models have potential strengths and
challenges. The greatest potential strength is in fully
probabilistic modelling, which may provide appropriate
estimates of cost-effectiveness in different circumstances,
which may be specified by the modeller. The updated
British NICE guide on the methods of technology
appraisal also recommended this approach
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Claxton et
al. 2005)</xref>
        . The greatest challenge is to avoid the situation
where the design and population of economic models is
undertaken with a particular aim and without objective use
of available data.
      </p>
      <p>The importance of country-specific evaluations of
effectiveness and, in particular, of economic data (e.g.
costs and cost-effectiveness) is something that needs to
be considered even in the earliest phases of study
development. Indeed, the timely documentation of
potential country-specific differences can simplify the
later analysis and interpretation of study findings.
Nevertheless, it would seem highly desirable to place
the available methods within a firm and binding framework—
for example by establishing binding national and international
guidelines.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The technical problems surrounding the health economic
assessments and adaptations based on multinational
studies are well known and generally accepted. From
the perspective of national decision makers, there is
nevertheless a great need to adapt the findings of these
studies to the local setting, especially in light of their
economic impact. There are a variety of methods for
identifying and adjusting country-specific differences in
costs, effects and cost-effectiveness. As a result,
multinational studies will continue to play a crucial role in the
evaluation of cost-effectiveness at the national level. It
seems likely that the growing interest in multinational
studies will lead to continued developments in adaptation
methods, thus helping to ensure the consistency and
transferability of study findings between various settings.
