        <p>This article reviews the political history of Czechoslovakia as a vital part of the Soviet-dominated “Communist bloc” and its repercussions for the journalist associations based in the country. Following an eventful history since 1918, Czechoslovakia changed in 1948 from a liberal democracy into a Communist regime. This had significant consequences for journalists and their national union and also for the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ), which had just established its headquarters in Prague. The second historical event to shake the political system was the “Prague Spring” of 1968 and its aftermath among journalists and their unions. The third landmark was the “Velvet Revolution” of 1989, which played a significant part in the fall of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and led to the closing of the old Union of Journalists in 1990, followed by the founding of a new Syndicate which refused to serve as the host of the IOJ. This led to a gradual disintegration and the closing down of what in the 1980s was the world's largest non-governmental organization in the media field.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        The starting point of this article is a story about the rise
and fall of the IOJ—an international non-governmental
organization of journalists based in Czechoslovakia,
which had become an icon of the changing political
landscape of the world since 1946. The same story has been
told in an anthology of the history of the international
movement of journalists (Nordernstreng, Björk,
Beyersdorf, Høyer, &amp; Lauk, 2016) and also in a monograph on
the IOJ (Nordenstreng, in press), but this was done
without covering the broader context of the political history
of Czechoslovakia. The present review aims to fill the gap
by first describing the key political turns in the history of
Czechoslovakia since World War I

      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>2.1. Four Periods between 1918 and 1948</title>
        <p>If we wish to understand the events which took place in
post-war Czechoslovakia, particularly in February 1948,
when the Communist Party took over political power in
the country, we need to go back another thirty years.
Czechoslovak history divides the period between 1918
and 1948 into four main phases: the First Republic,
the Second Republic, the Protectorate of Bohemia and
Moravia and the Third Republic.</p>
        <p>
          The period of the First Republic is defined by two
dates: 28 October 1918 (birth of independent
Czechoslovakia) and 30 September 1938 (signing of the Munich
Agreement). In 1918 Czechoslovakia ceased to be part of
the Austro–Hungarian Empire and became an
independent republic with a democratic polity based on the
Constitution. The country consisted of Bohemia, Moravia,
Silesia, Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia. The
Republic was characteristically multi-ethnic and there were
initially large social, cultural and economic differences
between its individual regions. The internal unity of the
new state was challenged by the German ethnic
minority living in the border regions and wishing to become
part of Germany, and the leftist labour movement, which
founded the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia
(henceforward the CPC) in May 1924. In the short term,
however, Czechoslovakia became a mature democratic
republic with a broad spectrum of political parties, and
the republic advanced in leaps and bounds in the fields
of industry, trade, education and lifestyle. An extensive
print media developed, the press being primarily
partisan, with a minority non-party press, tabloids and
magazines, and the new media of radio and film were
evolving. Partial censorship existed and was carried out by the
Ministry of Interior. Publishers had to submit mandatory
copies to district authorities or police headquarters, who
had the right to withhold prints prior to their release, to
allow the issue only after a change or deletion of the
text or even confiscate the press (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Končelík, Večeřa, &amp;
Orság, 2010</xref>
          ). Nevertheless, cultural openness and
tolerance prevailed.
        </p>
        <p>The next period of the Second Republic began with
the signing of the Munich Agreement and the creation of
the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia on 30
September 1938, lasting only until 15 March 1939. In this short
period, Czechoslovakia lost extensive border territories,
Slovakia, and Subcarpathian Ruthenia. Politically, the
country was subverted and the democratic principles of
the First Republic, organization and freedom were
destroyed. The Party of National Unity and the National
Labour Party became the only two political parties.1
Czechoslovak society perceived the Munich Agreement
as a defeat which threw it into disillusion and moral crisis.
These facts were also reflected in the media, with the
disappearance of many periodicals and the intensification
of censorship.</p>
        <p>The third period between 16 March 1939 and 8</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>May 1945 is known as the Protectorate of Bohemia and</title>
        <p>Moravia. The territory of the Protectorate included
practically all of the present-day Czech Republic, so Nazi
Germany effectively occupied the entire country. The Czech
president formally remained Head of the Protectorate,
along with the Protectorate’s Czech government.
Nevertheless, the real power—with a brutal and totalitarian
Nazi regime—was held by a Reichsprotektor, who was
hand-picked by Adolf Hitler. This means that the
Germans had the Czech economy, industrial and agricultural
production, transport, education and culture fully under
their control. The media were controlled by a Nazi
information monopoly and subjected to severe censorship. In
addition to the official media, illegal and media in-exile
were quickly established. The Czech population was
subjected to a programme of Germanisation. Citizens of
Jewish origin were deprived of their civil rights, persecuted
in various ways, including the confiscation of property,
and, starting in the autumn of 1941, were gradually
physically eliminated.</p>
        <p>
          Understandably, the Czech people did not accept the
occupation and resistance to it soon emerged. These
activities culminated in the assassination of the
Reichsprotektor. Meanwhile, the government-in-exile, led by
Edvard Beneš, was established in London. Any
expressions of anti-Nazi feeling were brutally suppressed by the
occupiers—punished by death, imprisonment or
detention in a concentration camp. Nevertheless, a number
of Czechs cooperated—collaborated—with the
occupying regime during the Protectorate. However, the
majority of the population continued to oppose the Germans
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Emmert, 2012)</xref>
          and, on 5 May 1945, resistance to the
occupation developed into an armed Prague uprising,2
which ended on 8 May 1945 with the defeat of Germany.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the fourth period from the May 1945 to
February 1948 is called the Third Republic. The basic document
establishing the direction of Czechoslovakia after World
War II was the Košice Government Programme,3 which
introduced the first post-war Czechoslovak Government
heavily influenced by the USSR—the winner of the war.</p>
        <p>
          It was drawn up by the Moscow-based leadership of the
CPC and proclaimed the confiscation of property
belonging to Germans, Hungarians and Czech collaborators, the
punishment of collaborators, an equal relationship
between Czechs and Slovaks, the establishment of National
Committees4 and fundamental changes in the economic
and social spheres, as well as the banning of the
activities of right-wing political parties. Accordingly, it not only
dealt with the punishment of war criminals, traitors and
collaborators, but also led to the rejection of the First
Republic’s political and economic system. Some Czech
1 The political system of the Second Republic was simplified and there were only two main political parties: (1) an “official” right-wing Party of
National Unity (Strana národní jednoty) gathering together the Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants, Czechoslovak Traders’ Party, National Fascist
Community, Czechoslovak Christian Social Party, National People’s Party, and (2) in “loyal” opposition, the left-wing National Labour Party (Národní
strana práce).
2 The Prague uprising was an attempt by the Czech resistance to liberate the city of Prague from German occupying forces. It lasted from 5 May until 8
May 1945, ending in a ceasefire between the Czech resistance and the German army, which decided to leave Prague on the same day. Next morning,
the Red Army entered the nearly liberated city.

4 The National Committee (1945–1990; NC) was a part of the Czechoslovak state administration with formally elected bodies. The NC was divided
according to the place of operation—from the top level of the country, within regions, districts and towns to municipalities. It performed as an “extended
arm” of the CPC for the economy and whole society.
historians view this part of Czechoslovak history in two
ways: either as a short period of freedom squeezed in
between two dictatorships (Nazi and Communist) or as the
trappings of democracy leading to the Communist snare.
(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Drápala, 2000</xref>
          )
        </p>
        <p>In May 1946 Czechoslovakia held its first post-war
parliamentary elections. A limited number of parties
participated in the election. While the CPC won in the Czech
lands with more than 40% of the vote, the Democratic
Party won in Slovakia with 60% of the vote. In June 1946,
the pre-war leader Edvard Beneš was confirmed as
President of the Republic, and he appointed a government led
by CPC chairman Klement Gottwald. In October 1946, the
Czechoslovak National Assembly approved an economic
plan for the reconstruction of post-war Czechoslovakia.</p>
        <p>In 1947 the USSR began to create the Eastern bloc
by arrangements such as a peace treaty concluded with
Hungary and a friendship and mutual assistance treaty
concluded with Poland. At this time Czechoslovakia
followed Moscow’s “advice” to withdraw from the Marshall
Plan and to sign a trade agreement with the USSR.</p>
        <p>In the post-war atmosphere the liberalism and
humanism which characterized the First Republic were
perceived by the majority of society as the root of all evil,
which was to blame for the hardships of war, human
degradation and the total collapse of modern society.</p>
        <p>The central theme of the time was socialism, which was
also complemented by nationalism and Slavonic
patriotism. In May 1945 the Ministry of Information issued a
Decree forbidding the publication of any printed
material, with the exception of selected dailies issued by
National Front parties. Further permission to publish was
only granted to those organisations which could prove
that this was in the public interest.</p>
        <p>
          In the Third Republic immediately after the war, the
Czechoslovak press was made up of three
ideologicalpolitical types: (1) the Communist press and
periodicals with Communist sympathies, (2) a democratic
leftwing press and (3) the non-Socialist press. Censorship
was not exercised, although the press laws dating back
to the First Republic provided for it. But the situation
changed in autumn 1947, when the Communists began
to perceive censorship as an indispensable instrument
of power. In December 1947 the Ministry of
Information created the Surveillance Department, which aimed
to monitor objectionable texts dealing with the national
economic plan, incitement against the Slavonic peoples
as well as deviation from the basic line in domestic and
foreign policy and matters connected to the defence of
the state
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Kaplan &amp; Tomášek, 1994)</xref>
          .
A dramatic government crisis started in Prague on 13
February 1948 when personnel changes in favour of the
Communists were made in the National Security Corps.
        </p>
        <p>The response to the ever-increasing influence of the CPC
was the resignation of the non-Communist ministers, 12
members of a 26-member government, on 20 February
1948. The CPC and groups sympathetic to it within
individual parties began to establish the National Front
Action Committees (NFAC), whose aim was to “cleanse” the
government and public life of all non-Communist
political forces. Two days later, the People’s Militia also came
into being, armed units consisting mostly of workers
directly controlled by the CPC. Their main aim was the
defence of industrial enterprises and the intimidation
of their political (anti-Socialist) opponents. The conflict
continued on 24 February 1948 with an hour-long
general strike in support of the CPC’s requirements, and
escalated on 25 February, when President Edvard Beneš
agreed to make changes in the government as suggested
by Klement Gottwald.</p>
        <p>This is how Communists came to power in
Czechoslovakia—widely known as the “Communist coup”. In early
May, a new Constitution was approved, and the
definitive influence of the CPC in the country was formally
confirmed on 30 May 1948 by the parliamentary elections.</p>
        <p>All the parties stood on a single list of candidates led by
the CPC and 89% of the electorate voted for them. 70%
of members of the National Assembly were Communists,
and the remaining members from other parties were
proCommunist. Finally, in June 1948, Klement Gottwald
became the new President.</p>
        <p>At this stage the CPC brought society under
totalitarian control. The economy was based on the
principle of central planning, and companies with more than
50 employees were nationalised. Under pressure from
Moscow, the CPC’s Central Committee began to take a
hard line against any criticism of the Communist system
or in favour of liberal thinking. There were a number of
fabricated political trials, forced labour camps were
created and the strict supervision of the censor covered not
only the field of culture, including the press, but also the
life of the Church. A counter-reaction to the situation was
a wave of emigration, during which a large community
of post-February 1948 emigrants founded publications
in exile. May 1951 saw the launch of Radio Free Europe
with regular broadcasts from Munich.</p>
        <p>
          After February 1948 the CPC began to introduce
censorship which would apply not only to the periodical and
non-periodical press, radio, film and the early days of TV,
but also to exhibitions, libraries, local records, posters,
advertising leaflets, badges, labels and the like. In this
way, the media became closely intertwined with the
system of political power, while the limits of journalistic
freedom were defined by the National Front and
selfcensorship (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Končelík et al., 2010</xref>
          ). The system of
censorship policed the flow of information both at home and
abroad. There was a ban on importing foreign
newspapers and magazines, press agencies were shut down, as
were cultural centres and information offices with their
headquarters in the West. The state security routinely
monitored correspondence sent from and to capitalist
countries and so on. In the coming years, everything that
did not suit the official ideas of the socialist press
gradually disappeared from the newspapers, while the
censor intervened not only in matters of content, but also
of form, and tried to influence production, print run and
scope. In this way, the Communist regime gained a total
information monopoly.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in the early 1950s, a more moderate
cultural policy was promoted. The reason for this was not
only the fact the Soviet ideas of socialist art had proved
problematic, but it was also a response to the growing
conflict within the CPC itself (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Knapík, 2006</xref>
          ). The concept
of the “new course”5 opened up the possibility of
liberalisation in Czechoslovakia’s cultural sphere between 1953
and 1956. After the death of Josef Stalin in 1953 and
the criticism by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, the regime
began to look more kindly on some still-rejected
personalities, less strict aesthetic criteria appeared, and even
some channels for contact with the West were
introduced. A new artistic generation began to take shape
that did not feel itself as bound to the dogmatic doctrines
of the late 1940s and early 1950s. While the Cold War
continued as an overall frame, it was possible to hope
for the promotion of liberalistic tendencies.
        </p>
        <p>The pressure for reforms in the CPC and other
aspects of everyday life increased after the mid-1960s. As
the reform supporters became increasingly recognized
in the CPC and public life, the liberal orientation in the
country and in the CPC gradually won the support of the
majority for a revised form of Communism.
In 1968 the world was in turmoil, with the war in
Vietnam, the civil rights movement in the USA and student
unrest throughout Europe, especially in France. It was a
unique year in post-war history, as 1848 had been a
hundred years earlier. And the “Prague Spring” became its
focal point.</p>
        <p>For a short period, from January to August 1968,
there was a huge development among politicians,
intellectuals, students and ordinary public life spheres in
Czechoslovakia. The social and political criticism of the
system had been gradual and fundamental and was
reflected in economy, central management, culture and
media. At the end of 1967 a crisis in the CPC itself
deepened and the party split into two groups: (1)
conservatives, represented by Antonín Novotný,
Czechoslovak president and CPC first secretary, and (2) reform
Communists, who wanted to democratize the old
politics. In January 1968 the big break happened, when
Antonín Novotný was removed as first secretary of the CPC
and replaced by Alexander Dubček, a reform Communist
from Slovakia.</p>
        <p>
          The motto of Dubček´s new political programme6
was “Socialism with a human face”. Although the
Czechoslovak economy should still be based on state or
co-operative ownership, non-Communist parties, broad
public community and free elections should also be
involved in political power. Admission to leading positions
and universities should no longer be contingent upon
CPC membership. The reforms also abolished censorship
and an informal alliance developed between Dubček´s
leadership and journalists. Indeed, the media played a
crucial role in the Prague Spring (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Končelík et al., 2010</xref>
          ).
        </p>
        <p>Freedom of speech flourished and different associations
like the scout movement were restored. The Prague
Spring changes were supported throughout society and
had a considerable international response.</p>
        <p>However, the Soviet Communist Party, together with
its sister parties in other Socialist countries, were afraid
of this revival process, and this fear led to the
occupation of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact military forces
on 21 August 1968. From September 1968 the so-called
Moscow Protocol was implemented in Czechoslovakia.</p>
        <p>The Czechoslovak population of course protested against
the occupation. The most radical act against the
restoration of the Communist dictatorship was that of Jan
Palach, a student of the Charles University, who burned
himself to death on 16 January 1969 at the Prague’s
Wenceslas Square. In April 1969 Gustáv Husák became
the first secretary of the Communist Party. Alexander
Dubček and his closest associates were soon removed
from public life and replaced by Soviet puppets.
Everyone who participated in the Prague Spring or disagreed
with the occupation was punished. Censorship was
reinstated and thousands of books and films were banned.</p>
        <p>Many Czechs and Slovaks left the country.</p>
        <p>The Prague Spring was consequently brought to a
drastic end and replaced by a sweeping political
process called “Normalization” lasting for 20 years. Officially
Czechoslovakia was a faithful member of the Eastern
bloc, and the CPC bureaucratic apparatus was severely
controlling all aspects of life. Yet under the surface
there existed an underground culture, intellectual
dissent, samizdat and an exile literature. The CPC
bureaucratic apparatus could no longer effectively control all
areas of society. The most significant manifestation of
the anti-Communist resistance was the publication of
Charter 77 with its civil movement established in January
1977, led by writer and later Czechoslovak President
Václav Havel and the university professor Jan Patočka.
5 The “new course” (nový kurs) was proclaimed by the leadership of the CPC after the deaths of Stalin and Gottwald in 1953. Its result was a more
benign approach to the middle classes; forced collectivisation in villages was temporarily halted, auxiliary technical battalions were disbanded, political
trials were discontinued and the process of revising their outcomes began, etc. See
http://www.edejiny.cz/obdobi-destalinizace-v-ceskoslovensku-1953%E2%80%93-1960
6 There were two main documents determining the Prague Spring: (1) Dubček´s CPC Action programme posted on 5 April 1968, related to the politics
and reform steps of CPC, and (2) the “Two thousand words” document written by Ludvík Vaculík together with leading Czech scientists, published on
27 July 1968. It was about the activation of the Czechoslovak public against the ever-evident pressure of the Soviet leadership against the reforms in
the country. The manifesto was signed by hundreds of public figures and more than 120,000 citizens, which led to the persecution of many people in
the period of normalization in the 1970s.</p>

      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>2.4. The Velvet Revolution of 1989</title>
        <p>The resistance to the Communist regime began to
increase in the late 1980s, in connection with Mikhail
Gorbachev’s rise to power in the USSR and policy of
perestroika and glasnost. The CPC claimed to agree with
this Soviet reform policy, but this was rather lip service.</p>
        <p>Demonstrations of disagreement with the totalitarian
regime proliferated, but were also severely suppressed
by the security forces.</p>
        <p>The most important actions took place on (1) 28
October 1988, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the
Czechoslovak Republic, (2) 16 January 1989, the 20th
anniversary of Jan Palach’s suicide, and (3) 29 June 1989,
the publication of “A Few Sentences”, a call by dissident
leaders for the release of political prisoners, open and
free discussion, including thorny historical issues, and
the end of censorship.7 The crucial event which
precipitated the Velvet Revolution, happened on 17
November 1989 in the centre of Prague, when security
police blocked and violently broke up a student procession
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
International Day of Students. The fundamental response to this
armed intervention was the founding of the Civic Forum,
headed by Václav Havel, to begin a dialogue with the
Communist leaders. Massive demonstrations took place
throughout Czechoslovakia in support of the Civic Forum,
and university students went on strike.</p>
        <p>
          On 24 November 1989, the CPC’s secretary
general Ladislav Adamec and his entire central
committee withdrew. The name of the state was changed to
Czecho-Slovak Federative Republic and the head of the
Federal assembly became Prague Spring leader
Alexander Dubček. On 29 December 1989 Václav Havel was
elected as the new President. During 1990
Czechoslovakia became a federal republic and the transformation
of Czechoslovak society and its economic, social and
political life from Communist totalitarianism to liberal
democracy could begin after long 40 years.
March 1946. On that occasion it was also agreed that
professional matters should in future fall under the remit of
the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement.9 The CJU
represented a community of altogether about 800
journalists
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Cebe, 2012)</xref>
          . In 1947, following the Act on the Status
of Editors and Journalists’ Unions, two journalists’ unions
were formed, the Czech union (formerly CJU) and the
Slovak union, while above them an umbrella organization
was established, the Central Union of Czechoslovak
Journalists (CUCSJ). In May 1947 the government passed the
Act on the Status of Editors and Journalists’ Unions.10 In
fact, the CJU and CUCSJ were more a tool of the regime
than a provider of benefits to journalists.
        </p>
        <p>On this basis, the practice of journalism was tied
to compulsory membership of the CJU, which had dire
consequences for many journalists in the post-February
cleansing. After February 1948, there were dynamic
political and social changes. Even in the CJU action
committees were founded and only those journalists who
were willing to work with the newly-established regime
remained members of the Union. The others were
excluded from their professional organization and thereby
lost all chances of working in the media. The NFAC forced
more than one hundred experienced journalists to leave
and consequently affected the Czechoslovak media for
decades. (Cebe, 2012)</p>
        <p>The new Communist Constitution of May 1948 had
two main consequences for journalists and their union.</p>
        <p>
          Firstly, although the new Constitution guaranteed
freedom of expression and prohibited censorship, the CPC
consistently monitored all media production, making
independent media in practice impossible. The journalist
became a mere instrument lacking any autonomy,
providing information on only politically-approved
interpretations of events. The economy was only to be portrayed
as flourishing, accompanied by the people’s efforts to
build it up. In the same way, both sports and scientific
achievements were to be ascribed to the merits of the
new Communist regime. The most significant instrument
for controlling the media was, of course, the staffing
policy, meaning that journalists were in constant fear of
losing their jobs. (

          )
        </p>
        <p>Secondly, a new, integrated Union of Czechoslovak
Journalists (UCSJ; 1948–1972), headquartered in Prague,
was founded and, within it, the National Union of Slovak
Journalists, headquartered in Bratislava. The state, rather
than the UCSJ, made the decisions regarding its focus,
organizational structure or the exercise of the

8 The succession of changing union formations from 1946 to 1990: 1946–1947: Czech Journalists Union (CJU); 1947–1948: Czech Journalists Union
(CJU), Slovak Journalists Union (SJU), Central Union of Czechoslovak Journalists (CUCSJ); 1948–1968: National Union of Czechoslovak Journalists (UCSJ),
Union of Slovak Journalists (USJ); 1968–1972: Unions of Czech (UCJ) and Slovak (USJ) Journalists, Headquarters; 1972–1990: Czech Union of Journalists
(CUJ), Slovak Union of Journalists (SUJ), National Czechoslovak Union of Journalists (NCSUJ), 1990: The Syndicate of Journalists of the Czech Republic.
(Ševčíková, 2015).
9 The Revolutionary Trade Union Movement Act was passed on 16 May 1946. In 1947, the decision was taken that the CJU should also fulfil the function
of a trade union. Divisional membership was voluntary; however, the CJU pointed out to its members that the CJU would not represent them in
professional issues if they were not members of the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement. From 1 January 1948, the Agreement on the Entry of Journalists
into the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement came into force and after that date, the majority of journalists joined a trade union.

ism as a profession and membership, meaning that the
organization toed the Communist party line throughout
its existence.</p>
        <p>From 1948, the CJU and UCSJ also served as the
gateway to international organizations, above all to the IOJ. In
July 1968, following the events of the Prague Spring, the
UCSJ held a landmark congress. A new statute and
several resolutions were adopted in support of a new model
of Socialism (“with a human face”), democracy and
freedom of the press, speech and information. The former
UCSJ was abolished and new Unions of Czech (UCJ, 1968–
1972) and Slovak (USJ, 1968–1972) Journalists,
including an umbrella organization (Headquarters, 1968–1972)
were formed.</p>
        <p>The new organizational model continued until
August 1968. Both the Headquarters and UCJ were under
the control of the Commission for the Preparation of the
II Congress of the UCJ, which soon overturned all the
decisions of the previous leadership and set up a cleansing
commission on the basis of which 479 journalists were
excluded from the Union and therefore also from their
profession between September 1968 to March 1970,
followed in 1972 by another 800 journalists.</p>
        <p>As of 1971 the whole union had a complete overhaul
in the line of normalization. In May 1972 a congress was
convened at which the Czech Union of Journalists (CUJ,
1972–1990), the Slovak Union of Journalists (SUJ, 1972–
1990) and the National Czechoslovak Union of Journalists
(NCSUJ, 1972–1990) were established.</p>
        <p>
          The big breakup of the NCSUJ took place at the turn
of 1989 and 1990, due to the political events of the
Velvet Revolution and the end of the Communist regime.
Immediately after 17 November 1989, a new management
of the CUJ, including the Bureau and its secretariat, was
elected. At the same time, the new Bureau of the CUJ
convened a general meeting on 16 December 1989, at
which it was decided to create a new journalist
organization, with the form of a syndicate. The old Union (CUJ)
was dissolved at the extraordinary congress of the CUJ
on 6 January 1990, and the successor organization
became the Syndicate of Journalists of the Czech Republic,
as a voluntary, independent, non-political, professionally
united union of Czech and Moravian journalists.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Prouza,

          The new Syndicate refused to join the IOJ and
instead became member of the IFJ.

      <sec id="sec-2-4">
        <title>4.1. Founding and Split</title>
        <p>
          The IOJ was founded at the International Congress of
Journalists in June 1946 in Copenhagen, the capital of
Denmark, which had only recently been liberated from
Nazi occupation. The congress was attended by 165
delegates11 from 21 countries. The post-war atmosphere was
one of joy and optimism. In Czechoslovakia, this came
just after the post-war parliamentary elections, which
brought the Communists to power as the leading
political force
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(for details of the first IOJ congresses, see
Nordenstreng &amp; Kubka, 1988)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>The provisional constitution was finalised and
approved at the second IOJ congress held in Prague in June
1947 and attended by 208 delegates from 21 countries,
the UN and UNESCO. The CJU, led by Jiří Hronek, was
responsible for organizing the congress and its patron was
President Edvard Beneš, who spoke at the opening
ceremony, as did Jan Masaryk (Czechoslovak Minister of
Foreign Affairs) and Klement Gottwald (Prime Minister and
CPC Chairman).</p>
        <p>The same positive atmosphere prevailed at the
second congress in Prague as one year earlier in
Copenhagen, although some tension about the impending
division of the world could already be sensed. While the
host union was in the middle of structural and
political changes, the congress went smoothly in impressive
settings. The constitutional statutes and principal
resolutions were approved unanimously, likewise the
leadership elected, with Archibald Kenyon of the UK continuing
as President and Vice Presidents coming from the USA,
USSR, France and Denmark. Hronek was unanimously
elected to the combined office of Secretary General and
Treasurer. But the site of the headquarters had to be put
to a vote, the majority supporting Prague, while a
minority led by British and Americans voted for London.</p>
        <p>
          In less than a year after the Prague congress, by early
1948, the Cold War had broken out and a wave of
political system changes in Central and Eastern Europe led
to a division of Europe into East and West, separated by
the “iron curtain”. The IOJ was part of this battleground,
becoming embroiled in Cold-War politics
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Nordenstreng
et al., 2016)</xref>
          . The post-war unity of professional
journalists was quickly replaced by distrust and antagonism
between the capitalist West and the socialist East,
exacerbated by political mobilization in both camps. Efforts
by the Czech Secretary General Hronek and the British
President Kenyon to hold the IOJ together were
overruled by orders from Cold-War strategists in London and
Washington, on the one hand, and the Soviet Communist
Party hardliners in Moscow, on the other (Nordenstreng,
in press).
        </p>
        <p>The IOJ headquarters in Prague chose the Soviet
side of the political divide as swiftly as the Czechoslovak
Union was moved to the Socialist camp. These two
processes were parallel and obviously reflections of a
common overall shift in global relations of power.</p>
        <p>In 1948–1949 the IOJ lost its West European and
North American members, except for left-leaning groups
of journalists there (mainly in France and Finland). The
third IOJ congress in Helsinki in 1950 confirmed the
change by changing the statutes in line with the
Communist approach, the bulk of the membership in the
Socialist countries of Central–Eastern Europe and newly
inde11 The Czechoslovak delegation to the Congress was represented by CJU Chairman Otakar Wünsch, Jiří Hronek, K. F. Zieris (CJU secretary) and Emil
Štefan (USJ).
pendent countries of the Third World, including
Communist China.</p>
        <p>The IOJ had become one of the “democratic
international organizations” closely associated with the USSR.</p>
        <p>The Western journalists’ associations established a new
International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) in Brussels in
1952—as part of the “Free West” countering the
“Communist East”. The Cold War politics led to the loss of the
IOJ’s affiliation with the UN and UNESCO, but it gained
new members in the developing countries of Africa, Asia
and Latin America. In 1966, its membership amounted
to 130,000 journalists in 108 countries, while the IFJ had
55,000 members in 31 countries.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-5">
        <title>4.2. The Prague Spring</title>
        <p>The IOJ continued to grow despite turmoil in its political
environment caused by the Prague Spring in 1968 and its
aftermath. The IOJ had its premises in the building of the
Czechoslovak Union UCSJ, and in August 1968 the whole
building was occupied by Warsaw pact forces. However,
the IOJ was soon allowed to return to its premises and
continued more or less as before, while the reformist
Czechoslovak Union was effectively replaced by a new
CJU (see above).</p>
        <p>Unlike in 1948, the IOJ did not dramatically follow the
system change implemented in the national union.
Actually the IOJ activities, including the monthly publication
The Democratic Journalist, had since the 1950s remained
quite true to the “Moscow line”, with no symptoms of
the Prague Spring. By the 1970s the IOJ was firmly
consolidated on the basis established in the late 1940s, now
increasingly dominated by an “anti-imperialist”
orientation reflecting the concerns of the developing countries
and meeting the Soviet interests. The changing climate
of international relations was also instrumental to
reinstating IOJ’s affiliation with the UN and UNESCO.</p>
        <p>Financial support for more and more activities
around the world came not only from the nominal
membership fees but from public “solidarity lotteries” in
East European Socialist countries. Moreover, a peculiar
source for financing was invented by new Secretary
General Jiří Kubka together with the Hungarian Treasurer
Norbert Siklósi: the IOJ was permitted, with the blessing
of the Communist Party, to establish commercial
companies in translation and conference services,
publishing, etc. This privilege made the IOJ quite rich,
facilitating a large secretariat with a publishing house,
training schools in European Socialist counties, regional
centres on all developing continents and large conferences
around the world.</p>
        <p>
          The heyday of the IOJ was in the late 1980s, when
its membership reached 300,000. By this time its
political line had become much more open and broad,
particularly by its active engagement in East–West détente
from 1973 on, leading gradually to contacts and even
cooperation with the IFJ in the 1980s
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Nordenstreng
et al., 2016)</xref>
          .
The Cold War world order began to crumble in late
1989, when first the Berlin Wall fell and then Prague was
shaken by the Velvet Revolution, followed by the fall of
Communism in Eastern Europe. Global geopolitics was
suddenly changed and the IOJ was challenged: its
headquarters and operations in Prague came under sharp
attack from the rising political forces in Czechoslovakia,
and its local member Union—the legal base for its seat
in Prague—was closed down and replaced by a new
Syndicate which did not want to affiliate with the IOJ but
joined the IFJ. Moreover, other strong member unions
in former Socialist countries, notably the USSR, began to
lose political and material ground. The IOJ’s financial
resources were rapidly dwindling and activities in training,
publication, etc. were gradually discontinued.
        </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, in 1991 the IOJ held its 11th congress
in Harare in fairly good shape, but by its 12th congress in
Amman in 1995 it was crippled by shrinking finances and
quarrelling leadership. After this, member unions one
after another decided to join the IFJ, while most of them
also remained nominal members of the IOJ. By the end
of the 1990s the IOJ had in fact disappeared from the
scene, whereas the IFJ had grown into an organization
also representing the bulk of the earlier IOJ membership.
Finally, in 2016, the last two IOJ presidents pronounced
the IOJ effectively dead (Nordenstreng, in press).</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>In summary: (1) the system change in 1948 from
liberal democracy to Communism in Czechoslovakia
immediately involved journalists with their national
association, and the IOJ followed suit driven by the same
developments among all the Soviet-dominated Eastern
European member associations, while the Western members
withdrew without an organizational fight; (2) the system
instability of 1968 with an attempt to liberalize
Communism hit the national association hard but did not extend
to the IOJ, which continued largely unchanged; (3) the
system change in 1989 caused an immediate upheaval in
the national association and the gradual disintegration
of the IOJ, again as a result of changes throughout the
Soviet block—a reverse process of 1948.</p>
      <p>The story of Czechoslovak journalist organizations
and the IOJ adds further evidence to the overall lesson
presented in Nordenstreng et al. (2016, p. 180):
international journalists’ associations are invariably bound by
their political environments and to believe that
journalists and their associations can ever be completely
apolitical is a naïve illusion. However, the international
movement is not deterministically driven by politics alone;
it is also driven by professional interests with more or
less autonomy.</p>
      <p>This article has mostly concerned the political history
of Czechoslovakia, which already suggests another
general conclusion: in order to understand the relationship
which the media and journalists, including their
associations, have to political system changes, it is vital to have
a profound knowledge of the history of the country in
question. All too often are changes in media and
journalists studied with a superficial understanding of the
historical context.</p>
