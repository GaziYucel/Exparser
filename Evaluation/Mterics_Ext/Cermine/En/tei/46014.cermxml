Only few previous studies have explored cross-national variation in the relationship
between educational certificates and competences. In this paper, we investigate the
certificate-competence relationship, operationalized as skills gaps by level of educational
attainment. More importantly, we scrutinize how two aspects of educational
stratification processes, vertical stratification and occupation-specificity, affects skills gaps.
Using data on 25-54 year olds from the 2011/12 round of the Programme for the
International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), we find that more occupation-specific
education systems produce smaller differences in basic general skills between adults
with low and intermediate levels of education. Higher levels of vertical stratification, by
contrast, result in larger low-intermediate skills gaps. None of the two stratification
aspects can however explain variations in the skills gaps between intermediate and
high educated adults. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for
labor market research.</p>

1. Introduction
Scholars agree that the relationship between educational degrees and
competences or skills may vary across countries. Yet previous research has devoted
surprisingly little attention to the sources of this cross-national variability. To our
knowledge, only one quantitative study has attempted to explain country
differences in the relationship between certificates and skills among adults: Using data
on 19 countries from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS, conducted
between 1994-1998 by the OECD), Park and Kyei (2011) examined literacy
differentials by level of formal qualification (less than upper secondary education, upper
secondary or non-tertiary post-secondary education, and college/tertiary
education). They found substantial cross-national variation in literacy gaps between less
and intermediate educated adults and, to a lesser extent, also between adults with
intermediate and high levels of formal qualification
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(cf. Park and Kyei
2011:8945)</xref>
          . The main country-level explanatory variable examined by Park and Kyei was
within-country heterogeneity of school quality, measured as between-school
inequality of various resources (e.g., instructional resources, class size, or teacher
experience). They showed that greater between-school resource inequality is
associated with larger low-intermediate literacy gaps. Resource inequality, however,
did not explain differences in intermediate-high literacy gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quite strikingly, Park and Kyei (2011) did not consider differences in
educational stratification processes as an explanatory factor. They argued that
“[b]ecause we are interested in literacy gaps between adults who did not graduate
from high school (or may never have attended high school) and adults with high
school degrees or higher, tracking is much less relevant for our study, even for
countries with tracking systems (unless the tracking occurs at an early age).
Moreover, studies that focus on tracking effects cannot address differences in
other important aspects of educational systems among countries with the same type
of tracking system.”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(Park and Kyei 2011:882)</xref>
          They decided to therefore “look at
institutional factors that are likely to be more universally relevant”, namely
between-school inequality in basic school resources
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(Park and Kyei 2011:882)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          In this study, we reconsider the potential role of educational stratification for
explaining skills gaps by educational attainment. We focus on two distinct types of
stratification: vertical stratification by student performance in lower secondary
education (e.g., via achievement-related tracking) and horizontal stratification in
terms of the primary content of educational programs in upper secondary
education (occupational/vocational vs. general). There are at least two reasons why we
should not rule out a priori that these two types of stratification condition the
relationship between formal certificates and competences. First of all, there is
substantial variability in the extent of stratification. Taking the example of vertical
stratification, it is clear that countries do not simply track or not: Tracked
education systems differ with respect to things such as the number of tracks or the age
when tracking occurs
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Bol and Van de Werfhorst 2013)</xref>
          . Further, as we discuss
below, even non-tracked education systems may differ in terms of how strongly
high- and low-performing students cluster in the same schools and classrooms
(e.g., because of differences in residential segregation). Second, and relatedly,
there are strong reasons to expect that educational stratification influences the
relationship between formal qualifications and competences: Educational
stratification processes channel individuals into different learning environments
(socialization) and/or different programs that lead to different levels of formal
qualification (allocation)
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(cf. Allmendinger 1989:236; Kerckhoff 1995:326; Meyer 1977)</xref>
          .
Higher degrees of educational stratification may thus affect the relationship
between competences and educational degrees via (competence-based) selection into
different (more or less favorable) learning environments or formal educational
programs
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Gamoran 1986; Hallinan 1992)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>More concretely, we extend the study by Park and Kyei (2011) in three ways.
First, we investigate the impact of educational stratification processes on skills
gaps by educational attainment, distinguishing between vertical (i.e.,
performance-related) stratification of lower secondary education and horizontal
stratification, that is, occupation-specificity of upper secondary education. We also
compare the importance of these dimensions of educational stratification to that of
between-school inequality in instructional resources in lower secondary
education, the focal variable of Park and Kyei (2011). Second, we use new data from the
first round of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies
(PIAAC)—conducted in 2011/12 by the OECD. This data set contains information on
educational certificates and generic basic competences (literacy and numeracy) of
the adult population for more than 20 countries. Not only are the competence
measures in PIAAC of much higher quality than in IALS (see Section 3). PIAAC also
embraces a broader country sample, especially by including
“achievementoriented” East Asian countries (Korea and Japan). Third, even though our empirical
contribution is restricted to (institutional sources of) cross-country variation in
skills gaps, we do discuss some important implications of our findings for the
interpretation of certificate and skills effects in labor market regressions.</p>
        <p>The paper is structured as follows. We start with theoretical considerations
about country variation in skills gaps by educational certificates (Section 2). In
Section 3, we describe the PIAAC data and the methods used in our analyses. We
present our empirical analysis in Section 4. Section 5 concludes by summarizing
our findings and discussing their implications for studies of competence and
certificate effects on labor market outcomes.
– 2 –</p>
        <p>Country variation in skills gaps by educational
degrees
We investigate country differences in two “skills gaps” as indications of the
relationship between competences and educational degrees: The “lower skills gap” is
defined as the (adjusted) difference in mean basic cognitive competences between
adults with low (less than upper secondary) and intermediate (upper secondary or
non-tertiary post-secondary) levels of educational attainment. The “upper skills
gap” is defined as the difference between adults with intermediate and high
(tertiary) levels of education.</p>
        <p>Our basic assumption is that educational stratification processes sort
individuals into different learning environments and thereby define opportunities to
acquire educational degrees and (different types of) competences or skills.
Correspondingly, one would expect that in more stratified systems formal certificates
tend to be more closely related to (specific types of) skills. Plausible mechanisms
through which more stratified systems strengthen the link between formal
qualifications and skills include selection on the basis of pre-existing differences in
competences (allocation), reinforcement of pre-existing differences due to the
allocation of better-performing students to more favorable learning environments
(socialization), and/or greater between-program (and hence between-student)
differences in the types of skills that are emphasized (socialization and allocation).</p>
        <p>Before we elaborate on these issues, we need to say a few words about the
types of skills measured in PIAAC. In all countries, respondents were assessed with
respect of two types of “key information-processing skills” (OECD 2013:3): literacy
(reading and text comprehension) and numeracy (applied numeric and
mathematical skills).1 These skills are undoubtedly important, but it is important to be clear
about what they are and what not. The literacy and numeracy skills assessed in
PIAAC are probably best described as basic (as opposed to advanced) and general
(as opposed to specific). The focus in the literacy domain was on the
comprehension of (short) pieces of text (such as instructions or newspaper articles) that
citizens of economically advanced societies might encounter in everyday life, inside
and outside of work. It was not on understanding (or writing) research articles or
other long and complex documents. In the numeracy domain, the focus similarly
was on everyday tasks involving numerical operations such as correctly
interpreting bar charts that might appear in newspaper articles or government
brochures. It was not on solving problems that require knowledge of inferential
statistics or calculus.</p>
        <p>Even though it is likely that the skills measured in PIAAC are to some extent
correlated with more advanced competences, the latter were not directly tested
(see Section 3). As we discuss below, this may limit our ability to ascertain

tence differentials in the upper part of the educational distribution, where we
would expect to see differences primarily with respect to advanced skills. In
addition, the skills assessed in PIAAC are general (or transferable) in the sense that
they are likely to be useful in a large variety of work- and non-work settings.
Occupation-specific skills (e.g., knowing the functioning of a car engine or certain
programming languages), which are useful only in a much smaller set of specific
occupations (and therefore emphasized by the respective training programs), were
not measured. In the following discussion of how educational stratification
conditions the link between formal qualification and skills, we will primarily focus on
the relationship between qualifications and basic general skills as they are
measured in PIAAC—because this is the relationship that we can ascertain empirically.
Nevertheless, the (unobserved) types of skill (advanced and occupation-specific)
also play a crucial part in our argument.</p>
        <p>
          Returning to educational stratification processes, we begin with vertical
stratification, by which we mean sorting by performance (ability) into different
educational environments. A well-known form of vertical stratification is external
differentiation via (ability) tracking. A broad definition of vertical stratification in
terms of “performance-segregated learning environments” directs attention to
vertical stratification occurring through processes other than explicit tracking.
Explicit tracking (or “external differentiation”) in lower secondary education
certainly is an important source of vertical stratification, but it is not the only one
possible. Residential segregation by family background—in combination with
residence-based allocation to schools—might result in high levels of vertical
stratification even in a system where children are not explicitly sorted into different
academic tracks (cf. Kerckhoff 1995:327). The US is a good example: It has a
comprehensive school system with little external differentiation, but due to
(socioeconomic) residential segregation nevertheless an intermediate degree of vertical
stratification—in the sense that there is considerable between-school variation in
average student performance, that is, high and low-performing students tend to
cluster in different schools. In the US-American case, a decentralized funding
system may further raise the consequences of this clustering for skills acquisition:
Because they tend to be located in less affluent neighborhoods, schools with
lower-performing students will typically have fewer resources
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(Park and Kyei
2011:883)</xref>
          . Other countries that differ noticeably in the degrees of school-level
segregation by student performance (“performance sorting”) and “external
differentiation” are Italy, Japan, and the UK (cf. Appendix Table A2).
        </p>
        <p>
          A first reason for expecting vertical stratification—school-level segregation
by performance—to be associated with differences in skills gaps is that
segregated learning environments may reinforce preexisting differences in competences:
Literature on the so-called reflected-glory (or assimilation) effect suggests that
lower-performing students’ motivation and learning processes benefit from
classmates with higher levels of proficiency
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref16">(e.g., Cialdini and Richardson 1980;
Snyder, Lassegard, and Ford 1986)</xref>
          . In more stratified systems, low-ability students
are deprived of such positive stimulation—when it comes to imparting basic
cognitive competences in literacy and numeracy. This reflected-glory effect might be
– 4 –
reinforced by larger differences in the aspiration levels of curricula and teacher’s
expectations and aspirations in more vertically stratified systems.
        </p>
        <p>A second mechanism through which vertical stratification might affect skills
gaps by educational attainment is selection. In countries with tracked systems,
low-performing students likely face greater difficulties in gaining access to
programs leading to higher educational degrees. Thus, at one and the same
educational level, there should be smaller within-group heterogeneity with respect to
preexisting differences in performance or ability. In particular, higher degrees of
vertical stratification in lower secondary education might raise the probability
that individuals with low initial levels of basic competences do not transition to or
complete upper secondary education, thus ending up in the group with low formal
qualifications. Conversely, in more inclusive systems, more of these individuals
would presumably be found among the intermediate educated, lowering the mean
competence level of this group—and thus the gap in basic competences between
the individuals with low and intermediate levels of formal qualifications. By the
same token, that is, because of selection processes that exclude low-performing
students from gaining access to programs at the upper secondary level, one might
expect skills gaps between intermediate and higher educated adults to be small(er)
in countries with higher degrees of vertical stratification.</p>
        <p>To sum up, if selection processes based on ability and/or reflected-glory-type
processes are important, then higher degrees of vertical stratification lead to a
situation where initial cognitive competences influence access to more favorable
educational environments, that is, to a mutually reinforcing process of
competence-based selection into less or more favorable learning environments. Given
the expected negative consequences of vertical stratification for low-performing
students, it is plausible to assume that vertical stratification primarily affects the
relationship between certificates and competences in the lower part of a country’s
educational distribution. Differences in basic cognitive competences between less
and intermediate educated individuals should be most strongly influenced by
selection and different learning opportunities: Low-performing students end up in
less stimulating learning environments in terms of enhancing their basic
cognitive competences.</p>
        <p>As for country-level variation in skills gaps, we therefore hypothesize that the
gap in basic competences between less and intermediate educated adults rises
with a country’s level of vertical stratification in lower secondary education
(hypothesis 1a). In contrast, according to the reflected-glory effect, individuals with
intermediate and high educational degrees should be exposed to more stimulating
schools or school tracks—and thus to learning environments that are more
similar with respect to preserving and enhancing basic (as opposed to advanced)
general competences. For the gap between intermediate and higher educated adults,
we would therefore expect to find no effect of vertical stratification. If anything,
we would expect to see smaller skills gaps in countries with higher degrees of
vertical stratification of lower secondary education, because of a selection effect (i.e.,
individuals with low competences are more effectively excluded from entering
educational programs that lead to intermediate formal qualifications) (hypothesis 1b).</p>
        <p>These hypotheses and especially hypothesis 1a are based on the assumption
that reflected-glory type processes predominate. There also exists a literature on
the so-called big-fish-little-pond effect (Marsh 1987), which argues opposite to the
reflected-glory effect. According to this explanation, the self-concept, motivation,
and ultimately performance level of lower-ability students are negatively affected
by peers with higher levels of proficiency. An implication of this effect is that
low-ability students would be better off in terms of motivation and learning in
more stratified school systems. In addition, teachers might be better able to tailor
their teaching to the needs of students if the latter are more homogeneous. These
arguments would suggest that hypothesis 1a will be falsified: The gap in basic
competences between less and intermediate educated adults should decrease with
a country’s level of vertical stratification in lower secondary education. In terms
of hypothesis 1b, only the selection effect would than apply, that is we would find
lower skills gaps in more stratified countries.</p>
        <p>
          The second dimension of educational stratification that likely affects skills
gaps is horizontal: the degree of occupation specificity of upper secondary education.
This feature is related to the question of what is learned in different tracks (at the
same educational level): whether a country’s system of upper secondary education
puts greater emphasis on general or occupational/vocational skills. In more
occupation-specific education systems, curricula and attention are directed more
towards vocational than general skills
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(cf. Hanushek, Woessmann, and Zhang 2011;
OECD 2010:59-60; OECD 2013:200-2; Shavit and Müller 2000)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>We cannot directly explore the relationship between general competences,
occupation-specific skills, and educational certificates with PIAAC (because
occupation-specific skills were not measured). But it is plausible to assume that greater
emphasis on occupation-specific skills in (upper) secondary education draws some
resources (e.g., teaching and learning time) away from the acquisition of general
cognitive skills. Thus, more of the learning time of intermediate-educated adults
is devoted to acquiring occupation-specific skills rather than basic competences in
countries with greater occupation-specificity. This is particularly true for
countries with apprenticeship systems, like Germany or Austria: “In many
apprenticeships, there is a rather small element of numeracy and literacy skills as part of the
(typically) one or one and a half days a week part-time school element in the dual
system.” (OECD 2010:60)</p>
        <p>
          In addition, occupation-specific upper secondary education systems are a
constitutive part of occupational labor markets
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(Marsden 1990; Hall and Soskice
2011)</xref>
          —meaning that in these countries adults with vocational upper secondary
education have rather good labor market opportunities in terms of occupying
skilled position, while in general upper secondary education systems school
leavers need to continue and finish tertiary education as a “safety net” to avoid
unskilled jobs
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Shavit and Müller 2000)</xref>
          . Hence, in the latter countries, more adults
attend college or university education than in occupational labor markets. This is
evident in a rather high correlation between degree of occupation-specificity of
upper secondary education system (Appendix Table A2) and the proportion of
tertiary educated adults (Appendix Table A1) of -0.65. This suggests that entry into
– 6 –
tertiary education is more selective with respect to preexisting differences in
performance or ability in occupation-specific countries—and less selective in
general-education countries.
        </p>
        <p>Given these two mechanisms—learning time devoted to general competences
in upper secondary education and selection into tertiary education—,
occupationspecificity in upper secondary education might again differently affect the size of
the lower and the upper skills gap. For the skills gap (in basic general
competences) between less and intermediate-educated adults, we expect to find smaller gaps
in countries with higher degrees of occupation-specificity of upper secondary
education—because the intermediate group devoted a substantial portion of their
learning time in upper secondary education to acquiring occupational rather than
general skills (hypothesis 2a). As for the upper skills gap—that is, the gap between
intermediate and higher educated adults—, we would expect it to be larger in
countries with higher degrees of occupational specificity (hypothesis 2b). Again,
this is partly because the intermediate group in more occupation-specific
countries more heavily invested in occupation-specific skills. Yet it is also because of
country differences in the selectivity of attending higher education: In
occupation-specific countries, where vocational training programs at the upper
secondary level provide a good alternative, those who decide to attend higher education
should be a more selective, academically inclined group than in general systems.</p>
        <p>One might suggest that we more directly test our assumption about the impact
of attending a vocational program in upper secondary education, namely by
comparing skills gaps between adults with vocational and general upper secondary
education. This is, however, not a convincing approach. The PIAAC data provide
only information on the highest educational degree completed. Hence those with
general (as opposed to vocational) upper secondary education do not comprise all
individuals who ever attended general programs at the upper secondary level:
They rather are a selective group that did not continue with tertiary education. In
this paper, we therefore rely on our indirect hypotheses and take their
verification/falsification as a signal (proxy) of “theoretical constructs that provide
hypothetical links between observable events,” although they cannot can be (directly)
observed (Hedström and Swedberg 1996:290).</p>
        <p>The two institutional characteristics of education systems—vertical
stratification and horizontal stratification in terms of occupation-specificity—co-exist in
different combinations and in some countries their effects may cancel each other
out. We expect the lower skills gaps to be smaller in more occupation-specific and
to be larger in more stratifying education systems—and vice versa for the upper
skills gap. Some well-known examples combine both a high degree of
occupationspecificity and of vertical stratification (like Austria or Germany), or both a low
degree of occupation-specificity and of vertical stratification (like Canada). If this
relationship (i.e., of a positive relationship between occupational specificity and
vertical stratification) holds more generally (which, as we show in Section 3, it
does), then the expected effects of occupational specificity and vertical
stratification should be stronger when both characteristics are included simultaneously in
the regression.</p>
        <p>Data and Methods
Data and sample
For our empirical analysis, we use data from the first round of the Programme for
the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (OECD 2013). Data collection took
place in 2011/2012 in a total of 24 countries. All samples are probability samples
of the 16 to 65 year old population, with a minimum sample size of 5,000 and a
total sample size of approximately 160,000 cases. Our analysis is based on the
public use files that are available on the OECD’s PIAAC webpage.2</p>
        <p>We include 21 of the 24 participating countries. We exclude Cyprus because of
a very high share of “literacy-related non-respondents” of 17.1 percent (for more
details, see below), Russia because of concerns about data quality, and Australia
because it does not provide a public use file. “Belgium” is included but PIAAC was
only conducted in the region of Flanders.</p>
        <p>PIAAC provides internationally comparable information on educational
certificates based on the 2011 revision of the International Standard Classification of
Education (ISCED). We distinguish between low (ISCED 0-2), intermediate (ISCED
34) and high (ISCED 5-6) education—roughly equivalent to having completed less
than upper secondary, upper secondary or (non-tertiary) post-secondary, and
tertiary education, respectively.</p>
        <p>The unique feature of PIAAC is that it provides high-quality data on basic
cognitive competences or “key information-processing skills” (OECD 2013). All
countries mandatorily administered test items to assess respondents’ reading and text
comprehension skills (literacy) and practical mathematical skills (numeracy). A
third skill domain, problem solving in technology-rich environments, was optional
and is therefore not available for all countries. Literacy and numeracy scores are
very highly correlated. For example, the country-level correlation between the
low-intermediate numeracy and literacy gaps (adjusted for key individual-level
characteristics, see below) is 0.95 in our sample. Results for literacy and numeracy
gaps therefore tend to be very similar and we only present results for numeracy
gaps in the paper.</p>
        <p>
          The PIAAC data are of much higher quality than the first large-scale
international survey of adult competences, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS),
which was conducted in the mid-1990s. First, the quality of competence
measurements has advanced considerably since the mid-1990s, partly due to the advances
spawned by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Second, in
IALS information on educational certificates was incorrect for four countries
(Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and the UK). These misclassifications can be
remediated based on information available in the IALS data
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(for details see
Gesthuizen, Solga, and Künster 2011)</xref>
          . Unfortunately, the erroneous education
var2 We use the updated public use files that were released on November 7, 2013, approximately one
month after the initial release (http://www.oecd.org/site/piaac/publicdataandanalysis.htm).
– 8 –
iables also lead to problems with the IALS competence scores that cannot be fixed:
To limit respondent burden, IALS—like other large-scale assessments such as
PISA, TIMSS, and also PIAAC—administered only a relatively small number of test
items to each interviewee. These items on their own are insufficient for
constructing accurate competence scores. Respondents were therefore assigned a set
of (multiply imputed) “plausible values” on the basis of test performance and
background characteristics. These background variables comprise various
education measures and in the case of IALS presumably included the erroneous
qualifications variable (detailed information on the imputation procedure are no longer
available, but see Kirsch, 2001:31, for further useful information).
        </p>
        <p>Our sample is restricted to respondents who were 25 to 54 years old in 2011,
that is, to birth cohorts 1957 to 1987. These respondents had mostly left education
in 2011 and went to secondary school between the 1960s and early 2000s—thus
after post-war educational expansion in most countries. We exclude respondents
who obtained their highest degree in a foreign country because their degrees and
competences cannot be considered as results of the education system of their
current country of residence.</p>
        <p>
          Some respondents sampled by PIAAC were not administered the full interview
because of insufficient proficiency in the interview language (the most common
reason), reading or writing difficulties, or learning or mental disabilities. For
these so-called “literacy-related non-respondents” (LRNR) only information on
gender and age is available. Excluding them from the analysis could bias our
results, because their share differs considerably across countries. In our sample, the
proportion of LRNR ranges from zero percent to 3.8 percent in the US and 4.8
percent in Belgium (see Appendix Table A1). Most LRNR likely have low levels of basic
competences and formal education. Even though country differences in the
proportion of LRNR may seem small, this group can be quite large in relation to the
group of less educated adults (ISCED 0-2). Excluding them could thus be quite
consequential when, as in this paper, less educated adults (or their difference to
intermediate educated adults) are of particular interest. Our analysis therefore
includes LRNR
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(in contrast to the study of Park and Kyei 2011, because this is not
possible with the IALS data)</xref>
          . For doing so, we had to assign LRNR respondents
values on all variables other than gender and age. We proceeded as follows. First we
assigned a (very low) numeracy score of 85 to LRNR. This is the value used by the
OECD (2013:69) in robustness checks that explore the impact of including LRNR on
country differences in average competence scores. Using these assumed
competence scores and information on age and gender, we then obtained 10 imputations
of all other variables relevant to our analysis, including highest educational
degree (see below). Including LRNR substantially raises the share of the
lesseducated group in some countries, for example, from about 10.2 to 13.0 percent in
the US and from 11.5 to 15.1 percent in Belgium.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the PIAAC data for the 21 countries in our analysis include a total of
88,818 observations who meet our age restriction. We exclude 3,538 cases who
obtained their highest degree in a foreign country and another 30 cases for whom
this information is missing although they do not belong to the group of
literacyrelated non-respondents. We exclude another 168 cases that are not LRNR, but
have missing information on at least one of the variables included in the analysis.
Our final sample comprises 83,999 “regular” respondents with complete
information and 1,079 literacy related non-respondents.3
Methods and variables
Our data have a two-level structure: We study respondents who are nested within
countries. We analyze these data using a two-step procedure. In a first step, we
estimate the two numeracy gaps for each of the 21 countries in our sample,
controlling for key individual characteristics (see below). In a second step, we then
regress the estimated numeracy gaps on our focal variables—different measures
of vertical stratification and occupation-specificity—and additional country-level
control variables (see below). These country-level regressions are estimated using
weighted least squares (WLS). WLS is used to increase efficiency by incorporating
information on the uncertainty of the numeracy gap estimates
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(as contained in
the standard errors of the estimated numeracy gaps; for further details on this
two-step approach, see Lewis and Linzer 2005)</xref>
          . We report
heteroscedasticityconsistent standard errors to safeguard against any remaining heteroscedasticity.
As a sensitivity analysis, we also carried out the two-step procedure with ordinary
least squares at the country level and the results were very similar (results are
available on request).
        </p>
        <p>
          This two-step approach is an alternative to simultaneous estimation via
(restricted) maximum likelihood, often referred to as hierarchical or multilevel
modeling. We opted for the two-step approach because it does not impose strong
assumptions on the distribution of the country-level error terms and allows the
effects of control variables to vary across countries
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Achen 2005)</xref>
          . Our approach also
facilitates inspection of country-specific estimates and thus the detection of
substantively interesting cases and/or outliers, which are readily overlooked with
simultaneous estimation and important to consider especially in country
comparisons consisting of less than 30 or even 50 cases
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Bryan and Jenkins 2013)</xref>
          .4
Descriptive information for all individual and country level variables is displayed in
Appendix Tables A1 and A2.
3 Consistent with our analysis of non-LRNR, we exclude LRNR from the analysis of a given
imputation if the variable “foreign degree” takes the value “true” for that imputation. The set of LRNR
cases included in the analysis thus differs slightly across imputations. Four LRNR are excluded
completely because they were imputed as having a foreign degree in all 10 imputations.
4 There is a shortage of systematic comparisons between these different approaches in
countrycomparative settings. It is clear on analytic grounds that simultaneous estimation will be more
efficient than the two-step approach when the data come reasonably close to meeting the
stronger assumptions of the former approach (e.g., normality of cluster-level error terms)—but it is not
clear how close “reasonably close” is. The efficiency gains are probably modest when the number
of individual observations per cluster is relatively large so that cluster-specific parameter
estimates are relatively precise (Lewis and Linzer 2005). This is the case in our application, as it is in
most applications where the higher-level units are countries (as opposed to, for instance, schools
or classrooms). Recent studies using the two-step method are
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Gebel and Giesecke (2011)</xref>
          and
Heisig (2011).

        </p>
        <p>Our individual-level regressions adjust mean numeracy differences between
educational groups (our two skills gaps) for differences in the following variables:
age (5-year groups), gender, being below age 30 and in formal education (to
account for country differences in the typical age of completing vocational and
tertiary education), and foreign-birth/foreign-language status (to control for country
variation in the migrant population) (see Appendix Table A1). The latter variable
has four categories indicating whether a respondent was born in the country
where she took the test and/or whether her primary language was that of the test
language or another language. We exclude adults with high levels of education
from the estimation of the lower skills gap and adults with low levels of education
from the estimation of the upper skills gap. The effects of these compositional
variables are thus allowed to differ across the educational distribution.</p>
        <p>As noted above, to limit respondent burden, PIAAC administered only a
relatively small number of test items to each individual. Individual competence scores
are therefore quite uncertain. To account for this uncertainty, PIAAC provides 10
so-called plausible values rather than a unique competence score for each
respondent, much like multiple imputation uses multiple imputations to account for
imputation uncertainty. PIAAC also provides jackknife replicate weights (80 for
most countries) to adjust variance estimates for the different complex survey
designs of participating countries. We also took these weights into account, meaning
that the estimated numeracy gaps and associated standard errors are based on up
to 800 regressions per country (80 jackknife weights—or the number of available
weights—times 10 plausible values). All estimations were carried out in Stata 13.</p>
        <p>We now describe the macro-level variables used in the country-level
regressions. For vertical stratification in secondary education, the prevailing practice is
to focus on external differentiation via tracking (i.e., the existence of different
school types). Bol and Van de Werfhorst’s (2013) Educational Systems Data Set
(version 4) provides an index of external differentiation that is based on the age of first
selection into different tracks (with lower ages corresponding to greater external
differentiation), the number of tracks available at age 15, and the length of
tracked education as a proportion of the total duration of primary and secondary
education. We will also use this variable in the present study.</p>
        <p>What this measure may fail to capture, however, is that segregation according
to student performance may occur through processes other than explicit tracking,
for instance, because of residential segregation. To capture such processes, we
need a measure that is sensitive to school-level differences in (average) student
performance within the same track. Such a measure is given by the proportion of
total variance in student performance that is attributable to between-school
differences, which the OECD regularly publishes in its PISA reports. More recent
publications often report its inverse (i.e., 1 minus the proportion of overall
performance variance), which the OECD also refers to as the “index of vertical inclusion.”
In these cases we simply inverted the measure again so that higher values
consistently correspond to higher levels of vertical stratification. In order to reduce
measurement error, we averaged all available estimates from the 2000, 2003,
2006, and 2009 PISA studies (i.e., we averaged estimates for different years and for
different domains such as reading, mathematics, and science) (OECD 2004, 2005,
2007, 2011). We call this indicator of vertical stratification performance sorting
index.</p>
        <p>
          We use two different measures of horizontal stratification in terms of
occupation-specificity. Previous research
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(e.g., Bol and Van de Werfhorst 2011; Van de
Werfhorst 2011)</xref>
          has often used the proportion of students in upper secondary
education who are in a vocational program (tracks). We also use this “vocational
orientation index”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref15">(again obtained from version 4 of the Educational Systems Data Set
by Bol and Van de Werfhorst, 2013)</xref>
          . We cannot compute this index from the PIAAC
data, because information on vocational education is subject to high proportions
of missing data in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the
United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          There also exists a large literature that captures occupation-specificity using a
fourfold typology of systems of upper secondary education: apprenticeship systems,
mixed systems, school-based vocational systems, and general systems
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(cf.
European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training 2013; Müller 1994; OECD
2000)</xref>
          . The first three types can be characterized as occupation-specific, but differ
in the strength of employer involvement in the development of curricula, time for
firm-based training, and the standardization of vocational certificates. The degree
of occupation-specificity is generally supposed to be largest in apprenticeship
countries and smallest in countries with general upper secondary education
systems. This classification suggests a different order of countries than the share of
students in vocational tracks (see Table A2 in the Appendix). For example, the
Czech Republic and the Netherlands have higher shares of vocational education
enrolment than Germany or Denmark. Based on the vocational orientation index,
the Czech Republic and the Netherlands—two countries with mixed systems—
would thus be considered as being more occupation-specific than the
apprenticeship countries Germany or Denmark. We will use both indicators of
occupationspecificity in our analysis as robustness check.
        </p>
        <p>Figure 1 displays the two measurements of vertical stratification and their
relationship to the vocational orientation index. Two points are noteworthy. First,
while both measures of vertical stratification are positively related to vocational
orientation index, the relationship is stronger for external differentiation
(Subgraph II) than for performance sorting (Subgraph I). This reflects the obvious fact
that external differentiation grasps tracking in lower and upper secondary
education and that some tracking is a necessary condition for having vocational tracks
in upper secondary education. Second, the positive relationship between the two
indicators of vertical stratification and the vocational orientation index suggests
that in many countries, the two institutional characteristics partly cancel each
other out when it comes to the size of the low-intermediate skills gaps. This
supports the idea that evidence for hypotheses 1a and 2a should be stronger when
including indicators of both characteristics simultaneously in the country-level
regression.

        <p>Country-level control variables
We also present specifications that include a set of country-level control variables.
As discussed above, Park and Kyei (2011) found that greater between-school
inequality of instructional resources is associated with greater literacy gaps between
less and intermediate educated adults. We will also include this factor in our
country-level regressions. The underlying measurement of school’s instructional
capacity is based on information collected through the Grade 8 school principal
questionnaires of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).
School principals indicated to what extent (4-point scale) their school’s capacity to
provide instruction was affected by shortages or inadequacies in 17 different
domains. Following Park and Kyei (2011), we averaged principals’ responses to these
17 items to obtain a measure of school resources and then computed the
schoollevel Theil index to capture inequality. We constructed this measure for the 1995,
1999, 2003, and 2007 TIMSS and averaged all available values for a given country
in order to reduce measurement error. Further information on the TIMSS studies
is available on at http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/. Column 10 in Appendix Table A2
reports the values of the Theil index for our country sample. The Pearson

based on models M5 and M7 in Tables 1 and 2.5 Subgraph I plots the residuals from
the regressions with the vocational orientation index and the performance sorting
index (models M5 in Tables 1 and 2). Subgraph II plots the residuals from the
regressions with the vocational orientation index and the external differentiation
indices (models M7 in Tables 1 and 2). Filled triangles represent estimates without
additional controls (Table 1) and hollow triangles depict estimates with additional
country-level controls (Table 2).
Notes. Calculations based on Tables 1 to 2. For country abbreviations see Figure 1.</p>
        <p>A first result apparent from Figure 4 (Subgraphs I and II) is that accounting for
country differences in occupation-specificity and vertical stratification
(performance sorting or external differentiation index) substantially reduces
crossnational variation in the (adjusted) lower numeracy gap. Whereas adjusted lower
5 More precisely, the figure displays the average residual numeracy gap across the ten imputed
country data sets (see Section 3).
numeracy gaps span a range of 42.8 points (cf. the discussion of Figure 3 above),
the residuals from the country-level regressions without additional controls
(filled triangles) span ranges of 32.8 points (vocational orientation and
performance sorting indices, Subgraph I) and 28.4 points (vocational orientation and
external differentiation indices, Subgraph II).</p>
        <p>Adding the country-level control variables further reduces the country
variation (hollow triangles), to 23.7 points (Subgraph I) and 19.4 points (Subgraph II). A
look at Table 2 suggests that this is primarily due to the control variable
“percentage point difference in training participation between adults with low and
intermediate levels of education”, because this is the control variable that has the
largest effect. Like Park and Kyei (2011:898), we find that lower numeracy gaps tend to
be smaller in countries that show less inequality in opportunities between less
and intermediate educated adults to receive adult education and training.</p>
        <p>Second, looking at outliers (hollow triangles including the controls), we see
that for the performance sorting index, quite large residuals (more than 5 points)
can be found for Finland and Korea in negative direction and Poland, France, the
Czech and Slovak Republic in positive direction. For the external differentiation
index, substantial outliners are also Finland, Korea, Poland, and the Slovak
Republic, and differently, Austria, Japan, the UK, and the US. The latter three countries
are interesting, because these are countries which show a much lower degree of
vertical stratification in terms of external differentiation than of performance
sorting. For the majority of country cases the two indicators of vertical
stratification seem to perform similarly well, however.</p>
        <p>Intermediate-high numeracy gaps
We now turn to the upper numeracy gap. Figure 5 plots the (unadjusted and
adjusted) gap between adults with high (ISCED 5-6) and intermediate (ISCED 3-4)
levels of education. Overall, we find somewhat smaller numeracy gaps than for the
lower part of the educational distribution. In contrast to the lower numeracy gap,
Figure 5 shows that compositional differences between adults with intermediate
and high formal qualifications tend to explain only a small part of the of the upper
numeracy gap and therefore also do not account for much of the country
differences. The raw and adjusted numeracy gaps are very similar in all countries. The
adjusted numeracy gap is smallest in Italy (16.8 points) and highest in the US (51.0
points), implying a range of 34.2 points.
– 22 –
Countries are ordered according to the size of the adjusted upper skills gap. For country
abbreviations see Figure 1.</p>
        <p>Source: PIAAC 2012, authors’ calculations.</p>
        <p>The results for the impact of educational stratification processes on the
intermediate-high skills gaps can be briefly summarized. They are displayed in Table 3
(without control variables) and Table 4 (including the control variables). None of
the indicators of occupation-specificity and vertical stratification reaches
statistical significance in any specification. Moreover, the effect sizes are much smaller
than for the low-intermediate skills gaps. The only substantial difference,
although not significant, can be found for the comparison of apprenticeship systems
versus general education systems (models M6 and M8 in Table 4). As expected, the
upper skills gap tends to be larger in apprenticeship systems (where the
intermediate group invests heavily in occupation-specific skills and where the tertiary
educated presumably are a more selective, academically inclined group). Overall,
however, hypothesis 2b, which predicted this pattern to hold more generally, is
not confirmed. We also expected vertical stratification to be unrelated to the upper
skills gap or even slightly negatively related to the upper skills gap (hypothesis
1b). The coefficient estimates on both measures of vertical stratification
(performance sorting and external differentiation index) are indeed not significant and
tend to very small (and negative). This result supports our hypothesis.</p>

        <p>Although the variation in the (adjusted) intermediate-high numeracy gap is quite
substantial (see Figure 5), differences in vertical and horizontal stratification do
not contribute much to their explanation. This confirms our argument that it is
important, first, to separately investigate the lower and upper parts of the
educational distribution and, second, to keep in mind that PIAAC is measuring basic

(% point difference in adult training participation between ISCED 5-6 vs. 3-4) is

have mostly acquired the basic cognitive competences measured in PIAAC during

schooling whereas training opportunities do provide a second chance of learning
for less educated adults.

        <p>Finally, model M9 in Table 3 displays again that between-school inequality in
instructional resources (Park and Kyei’s Theil index) is not significant (the same
results are found for literacy). It does seem to be somewhat more strongly related to
the upper skills gap in the specifications in Table 4 (which include the other
country-level controls and different combinations of the measures of vertical
stratification and occupational specificity): Here, the estimates do suggest that the upper
skills gap is lower in countries with higher levels of between-school resource
inequality in lower secondary education. In two specifications (models M2 and M5)
this effect is significant at the ten percent level and model M1 it even reaches
significance at the 5 percent level. Nonetheless, this finding contradicts the results
by Park and Kyei (2011), whose results suggest that there is no clear or perhaps a
small positive relationship between school-level resource inequality and the
upper skills gap. Further research is needed to reconcile these divergent findings.</p>
        <p>Conclusions
The main goal of our paper was to investigate the importance of educational
stratification processes for the relationship between certificates and competences,
operationalized as skills gaps by educational attainment. We have chosen to display
the results for numeracy, but the results for literacy are very similar (available
upon request). We explored the impact of two aspects of educational stratification:
vertical stratification of lower secondary education (sorting by
performance/ability) and occupation-specificity of upper secondary education.</p>
        <p>Our two-step approach of accounting for country differences in skills gaps by
compositional differences (individual-level regressions, first step) and
institutional differences (country-level regressions, second step) revealed interesting
differences for the lower and upper part of the educational distribution for each of the
two steps.</p>
        <p>First, whereas a high portion of the country variation in the low-intermediate
skills gap could be explained by compositional differences with respect to age,
gender, migration/language background, and participation in education (under age
30), this was not the case for country variation in the intermediate-high skills gap.</p>
        <p>Moreover concerning the impact of educational stratification processes, the
results for country variation in the lower skills gaps (between less and
intermediate educated adults) confirm our hypotheses: Higher levels of vertical
stratification increase the lower skills gap (hypothesis 1a) and greater horizontal
stratification in terms of occupation-specificity of upper secondary education reduces it
(hypothesis 2a). As for the role of vertical stratification (hypothesis 1a), we could
not determine to what extent it is due to differences in learning opportunities and
to selection on the basis of pre-existing competence/ability. Nevertheless, our
results would seem to support the reflected-glory story—which posits a positive
effect of more inclusive education systems for low-achieving students—rather
than the big-fish-little-pond effect, which assumes a positive effect of
abilitysorted educational environments (see Section 2). The confirmation of hypothesis
2a is consistent with the idea that occupation-specific systems devote greater
resources to the enhancement of occupation-specific skills (especially in upper
secondary education). Adults who have completed such programs therefore score
lower on the kinds of non-occupational general skills assessed in PIAAC. As
predicted, we also found that the effects of our different indicators of vertical and
horizontal stratification on the low-intermediate numeracy gap became stronger
when both aspects of stratification were included in the regression. Both vertical
and horizontal stratification are at work, but their effects partly cancel each other
out because they tend to be positively correlated, yet influence the lower skills
gap in opposite directions.</p>
        <p>As for the intermediate-high (upper) skills gap, we found some support for
hypothesis 1b, which expected no (or, if at all, a negative) impact of vertical
stratification on the upper skills gap. Hypothesis 2b predicted a larger upper skills gap in
countries with occupation-specific upper secondary education due to higher
selection into tertiary education. It was not confirmed. Nevertheless, specifications
including further country-level control variables (Table 4) yielded a sizeable effect
for apprenticeship systems compared to other types of upper secondary education
system, even though it did not reach conventional significance levels. Given that
there are only three apprenticeship countries in the sample (which of course
limits statistical power), this may be seen as some indication that more
occupationspecific and especially in apprenticeship systems are characterized by stronger
selectivity of tertiary education attendance, which presumably drives up skills
differentials between adults with upper secondary and tertiary education.</p>
        <p>In sum, our main result is that the lower skills gap can be explained quite well
by compositional differences and by differences in educational stratification
processes. Thus, in contrast to the argument by Park and Kyei (2011, see Section 1),
stratification processes do account for a substantial part of the variation in the
low-intermediate skills gap. As in the study of Park and Kyei (2011), we also found
that participation in adult education or, more precisely, the trainings gap between
less and intermediate educated adults is related to the lower skills gap.</p>
        <p>Park and Kyei’s (2011) result that between-school resource inequality is a
major predictor of the lower skills gap received much less support, however. One
possible explanation for these divergent findings might be differences in sample
restrictions or the type of skills studied. Yet, as mentioned already in Section 3,
our results do not change substantially when we mimic Park and Kyei’s study
more closely by including only the age group 25-34 and/or focusing on literacy
rather than numeracy gaps. Another explanation could be differences in data
quality. For example, Park and Kyei (2011) found Germany to have a very small
lower skills gap in IALS, whereas in PIAAC the gap in Germany is among the
largest (cf. Figure 3). We cannot rule out the possibility that these results reflect a
genuine trend. However, problems with the IALS data for Germany (and a few
other countries) that have only recently become obvious (cf. Section 3) render the
validity of the IALS-based estimate dubious and we are inclined to take the
PIAACbased one more seriously. On a more substantive level, it may also be important to
recognize that school-level resource inequality is an ambiguous predictor. In
particular, resource inequality should be most likely to enhance between-student
inequalities if schools with above-average students also tend to have
aboveaverage resources. Conversely, if extra resources are targeted at disadvantaged
schools or neighborhoods with low-performing students, resource inequality
might well have equalizing effects. In other words: the level of school-level
resource inequality per se may be less important than how it is related to
schoollevel student composition. Future research should attempt to develop measures
that are capable of differentiating between these scenarios—something we could
not do in this paper where the main focus was on educational stratification.</p>
        <p>As for the upper skills gap between intermediate and tertiary educated adults,
none of the indicators of educational stratification had a clear effect and neither
had the other country-level (control) variables. At best, we got some hints that
stronger selection into tertiary education in countries with apprenticeship
systems plays a role. We clearly need further studies that develop and test new ideas
how education systems shape differences in basic cognitive competences between
adults with intermediate and higher degrees of formal qualification.</p>
        <p>Labor market implications
As a last point, we would like to discuss the relevance of our findings for broader
discussions about the interpretation of labor market returns to competences and
educational certificates. Given the easy availability of competence data from
PIAAC, new empirical analyses of the impact of (basic) competences and
educational certificates on labor market outcomes can be expected to mushroom during the
next few years. But how should we interpret the effects of skills and certificates
that will be revealed in these analyses?</p>
        <p>
          A long-standing debate that our analysis speaks to is whether and to what
extent the well-documented positive relationship between educational attainment
and labor market outcomes such as wages reflects productivity differentials or
rents. According to the productivity explanation
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(emphasized by human capital or
signaling theory; Becker 1964; Spence 1973)</xref>
          , individuals with higher levels of
education have better labor market outcomes because they have more job-relevant
skills than workers with lower levels of education. By contrast, the rent story
argues that educational certificates at least partly serve as devices that artificially
restrict access to jobs, thereby ensuring that the holders of credentials achieve
better labor market outcomes than they would if access were unrestricted
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Collins
1979; Sørensen 2000)</xref>
          . These different ideas about education have stimulated a
sizable literature that seeks to identify the productivity and rent components of
the effect of education on labor market outcomes
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(cf. Barone and Van de Werfhorst
2011; Bowles and Gintis 2000, 2002)</xref>
          . In 2011, the journal Research in Social
Stratification and Mobility
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref4 ref7 ref8">(Bills and Brown 2011)</xref>
          dedicated an entire special issue to this
question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confronted with a regression that uses PIAAC to simultaneously estimate the
impact of educational certificates and skills on a labor market outcome, the most
straightforward response would perhaps be to interpret the net skills effect
(controlled for certificates) as reflecting productivity differentials and the net
certificate effects (controlled for skills) as reflecting rents. This would only be
appropriate, however, if the meaning of skills (as measured in PIAAC) and of certificates did
not vary across countries. Yet our results for the lower skills gap suggest that this
is the case
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(see also Bills 2003: 439)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>The clear negative relationship between occupation-specificity of upper
secondary education and the lower skills gap (hypothesis 2a) is indirect evidence that
the intermediate group in more occupation-specific countries invests in
occupation-specific rather than in the basic general skills that were measured in PIAAC.
This suggests that controlling for measured skills does not effectively remove
skills differentials between workers (with respect to occupation-specific skills),
particularly in occupation-specific systems. In addition to rent effects, the net
effects of educational certificates would thus capture differentials with respect to
occupation-specific skills—especially in countries where upper secondary
education emphasizes these kinds of skills. Other things being equal, we would
therefore expect to find larger net certificate effects on labor market outcomes in more
occupation-specific countries, as Van de Werfhorst (2011) already did on the basis
of the IALS data. Our results corroborate his interpretation that this pattern partly
reflects skills/productivity differentials (rather than only better opportunities for
generating rents via occupational licensing in more occupation-specific
countries).</p>
        <p>
          The finding that the lower skills gap rises with the level of vertical
stratification in lower secondary education (hypothesis 1a) may also have implications for
the labor market effects of educational credentials. In particular, this finding
suggests that having completed (at least) an intermediate-level educational program
is a better predictor of an individual’s actual level of skills in countries with
higher levels of vertical stratification. Theories of job-market signaling (Spence 1973)
and statistical discrimination
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Aigner and Cain 1977)</xref>
          suggest that this may
enhance certificate effects even net of actual individual-level skills: These theories
argue that worker’s actual levels of skills or productivity are difficult to ascertain
and that prospective employer will rely on formal educational credentials as a
low-cost way of screening applicants. They should be especially likely to do so if
the credentials are highly informative with respect to the applicant’s actual level
of skills, which our findings suggest is the case in vertically stratifying countries.
This should amplify labor market effects of formal credentials even after
controlling for actual individual skills or ability.
        </p>
        <p>Future research should use PIAAC and similar data sets to empirically
investigate this possibility. Research along those lines should examine the lower and the
upper part of the educational distribution separately, as we found the impact of
vertical and horizontal stratification to be quite different for the lower and the
upper skills gap. Researchers thus need to carefully consider not only that the
relationship between competences and certificates differs across countries, but also
that the processes generating this relationship differ between the upper and the
lower parts of the educational distribution.
