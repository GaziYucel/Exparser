Conflict and Consonance in Media Opinion:.</p>
      <p>Political Positions of five German Quality Newspapers
Discussion Paper P 01-702.</p>
      <p>Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung (WZB).
The paper examines the degree of conflict and consonance in the editorials of five German
quality newspapers between 1994 and 1998. The degree of correspondence in the media
system is discussed against the background of Germany´s pluralistic media structure on the
one hand and concepts of public opinion on the other hand. Rather than investigating the
differential issue selection among the newspapers the analysis compares the opinions on
issues correspondingly addressed by several newspapers. It focuses on the newspapers´
positions regarding fundamental political conflicts and identifies spheres of consensus and
conflict in the media system. Although the newspapers represent distinctly different
political orientations each of them also showed issue-specific deviations from its general
preference for left or right policy alternatives. Results indicate considerable degrees of
consonance regarding external relations issues and education policy. Conflict evolved
around law and order and migration issues.</p>

        <title>Zusammenfassung</title>
        <p>Das Papier untersucht das Ausmaß von Konflikt und Konsonanz in den Kommentaren der
fünf Deutschen Qualitätszeitungen zwischen 1994 und 1998. Der Grad der
Übereinstimmungen wird vor dem Hintergrund der pluralistischen Struktur des Mediensystems
einerseits und Ansätzen zur öffentlichen Meinungsbildung andererseits diskutiert. Nicht die
zeitungsspezifisch unterschiedliche Themenauswahl, sondern die unterschiedlichen
Meinungen, die zu einem von mehreren Zeitungen gleichzeitig ins Spiel gebrachten Thema
vertreten werden, stehen im Mittelpunkt des Interesses. Die Analyse vergleicht die
Positionen, die die Zeitungen zu politischen Grundkonflikten vertreten, und bestimmt Sphären des
Konsenses und des Konflikts im Mediensystem. Trotz der unterschiedlichen politischen
Grundorientierungen der Zeitungen zeigten sich bei bestimmten Themen jeweils auch
Abweichungen der Zeitungen von ihrer generellen Präferenz für linke oder rechte
Politikalternativen. Es ergab sich ein beträchtliches Ausmaß an Konsonanz für Themen aus dem
Bereich der internationalen Beziehungen sowie für die Bildungspolitik. Konfliktreicher
verlief dagegen der mediale Diskurs zur Rechts- und Ordnungspolitik sowie zu Fragen der
Migration.</p>

            The dissemination of information is an undisputed function of the mass media in modern
societies. Where a face-to-face exchange of information between all segments of society has
become impossible, the mass media mediate information between the audience and the
political actors and thus constitute one of the most important subsystems of society. Yet,
media in this perspective are frequently attributed a predominantly passive role as they are
seen to provide a forum for the exchange of information between a variety of actors without
contributing their own view. Restricting the role of the media to their primary function of
information dissemination is not only a deficient description of the media but also means
distorting and underestimating the legitimate active role of the media in the process of
opinion formation. Recent contributions on media performance in modern democracies
have drawn attention to the more persuasive and evaluative functions of the media

            The increase in research activity under the heading of „framing“ is a good illustration of
the shift towards the persuasive and evaluative dimensions of mass communication. After a
period of concentration on the information function of media and cognitive effects scholars
have rediscovered attitudes and opinions2. Re-introducing opinion as relevant factor in
communication research not only implies a broader perspective on media effects in the
audience, it should also modify and differentiate our conceptualization of the media
themselves. A systematic incorporation of persuasive and evaluative dimensions directs
attention to the media’s political positions and the ways these are communicated. This
paper takes the perspective of media as political actors with genuine interests and goals
trying to find resonance for their opinions in the audience and the political system. Media
do not only act as neutral information agencies providing a forum for other actors but take
an active role in the political process by selecting and structuring information, interpreting

          <p>Media´s political positions are most openly and legitimately expressed in the opinion
sections. Through editorials the media publicly express their opinions and make use of their
right to present themselves as autonomous actors. In editorials rather than in the news section
the different media outlets establish a particular ideological profile that makes them
distinguishable from their competitors and binds certain segments of the audience. By
focusing on editorials this paper investigates the particular political positions of the German
quality press without regarding its performance in disseminating information. Rather than
conceptionalizing the media as collective actor with a uniform political position, the paper
sets out to examine the particular constellations of opinion in the media system.</p>
          <p>Considering the pluralistic structure of the German media system and the distribution of
the newspapers across the entire range of the political spectrum there should be a
considerable degree of conflict between papers with opposite political positions and
divergent party allegiances. Yet, many scholars assume a high level of consonance in
media discourse resulting from corresponding professional routines, the homogeneity of
class interests, and journalistic co-orientation. The paper discusses the conditions and
consequences of consonance and conflict in the media system and relate these to the idea
of pluralism and on the one hand and concepts assuming high degrees of consonance in
public opinion on the other hand. Applying the position model of party competition to the
media system it is investigated to what extent newspapers differ in terms of their particular
political positions on particular issues and where spheres of consensus nevertheless develop.
The empirical data presented in this paper is derived from a larger project on editorial
discourse in the German quality press currently conducted at the Social Science Center
Berlin3.</p>

        <title>2. Diversity vs. Consonance</title>
        <p>In modern democracies the mass media maintain and structure the constant exchange of
issues and opinions between different actors. Understanding media functions as desirable
outputs of subsystems for the greater entity, information, critical observation and
orientation are the primary democratic functions the media are expected to fulfil. The
neutral dissemination of information between the political elite and the citizens
undoubtedly represents the most obvious media function. It has evoked large amounts of
research whereas the other media functions have received comparably little attention. The
watchdog metaphor refers to the media´s assignment of critically observing the political
process and ensuring a certain degree of accountability regarding the political actors. The
critical observation builds on the information function and applies the idea of freedom of
information to the relation between the individual and the state. In order to serve as
watchdogs of the political process the media have to be independent of the incumbent
authorities. In Germany – like in most modern democracies – effective and collectively
binding criticism is assumed to be guaranteed through the structural diversity of the media
system. In the print sector and in the privately owned electronic media (as opposed to the
public broadcasting system) the idea of pluralism depicts the inter-media-diversity rather
than the intra-media-diversity. The individual media outlet is not expected to present a
balanced opinion.</p>
        <p>Orientation representing the last of the three primary democratic media functions has
been widely neglected in the scholarly discourse on media performance (Voltmer 1998/99,
14). It explicitly relates to interpretive, evaluative and possibly persuasive media content.
The media support the process of opinion formation by critically discussing arguments and
making judgements regarding particular policy options, actors´ performances and political
decisions. Considering the ever increasing amounts of unconnected information supplied
by the media interpretations and evaluative statements that “make some sense” out of those
fragments and thereby provide orientation for the audience gain special significance. Since
editorials provide „biased information“ they comply with people´s need for orientation
(Weaver 1977) and enable the audience to make political judgements on the basis of
limited rationality (Calvert 1985). Hackett suggests to substitute the term “bias” by
„structured orientation“ (Hackett 1984, 254). One way of reducing the cognitive effort in
opinion formation is relating one´s own opinion to the political positions of certain elites
who are assumed to have similar attitudes and opinions (Zaller 1992). German quality
newspapers also seem to be suited for serving as orientation marks for the opinion
formation of the audience because they stand for certain political positions and their
readers are divided accordingly4.</p>
        <p>Like the media´s functions of information and critical observation the orientation
function relies on the pluralistic structure of the media system. It is assumed that as long as
a pluralistic media structure is guaranteed the media will provide a wide range of facts and
opinions needed for independent opinion formation. Only if the media is open towards the
variety of societal voices, it can disseminate unbiased, comprehensive and complete
information. Only if the media is independent of state, party or economic influence it is
able to act as a watchdog supervising the political process. And only if it represents a
variety of opinions, it can provide sufficient orientation for the audience and support the
audience´s opinion formation. Thus, pluralism may be regarded as the normative basis for
a well-functioning democratic media system.
4 See the findings of the “Allensbacher Werbeträger-Analyse” 1995, where the prestige press audience in</p>
        <p>Germany is broken down into their political orientation (Schulz 1997, 104).</p>
        <p>Taking a macro-level perspective on media content means we are not interested in
single editorials but in the universe of issues and opinions in the media system. Most
investigations of media opinion conceptionalize media as uniform collective actor without
differentiating between individual outlets with opposite political positions and divergent
party allegiances. Yet, the plurality of voices in the media system has to be considered and
special attention has to be directed to the particular constellations of correspondence and
divergence among different media outlets. The structural pluralism in the German media
system provides for a certain degree of political conflict in the media system. It can be
expected that media outlets with a liberal editorial stance hold different opinions than their
more conservative counterparts. The differences between media outlets are likely to follow
party lines considering that „the same social forces that find expression in the party or
parties of a political system tend to find expression also through the press“ (Seymoure-Ure
1974, 159). This leads not only to a parallelism between certain papers and parties but also
implies a correspondence between the range of papers and the range of parties.</p>
        <p>In Germany, the press-party-parallelism is rooted in the tradition of party journalism.
Although there is no relevant paper with institutional links to a particular party any more,
the party structure is still reflected in today’s press system, especially in the
opinionleading national quality newspapers. Several empirical studies show that German national
quality newspapers cover almost the entire political spectrum with the Welt located at the
right and the Tageszeitung (taz) at the left of the continuum. Between these poles,
beginning from the right and proceeding to the left, there are the Frankfurter Allgemeine
(FAZ), the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (FR) (Kepplinger
1985, Hagen 1992, Schönbach 1977, Donsbach/Wolling/Blomberg 1996).</p>
        <p>
          In any pluralistic media system different media outlets compete against each other by
developing a distinct content profile in order to position and stabilize themselves in the
audience market and become distinguishable from other media outlets. Therefore, we
expect considerable differences in the ideological positions of the different newspapers.
Some structural characteristics of media systems, however, seem to suggest the opposite: the
corresponding standardized attention criteria and interpretation strategies, the uniformity of
professional and class interests, the media’s observation of each other and their reciprocal
coorientation are likely to produce high levels of correspondence in the media system
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref9">(NoelleNeumann 1973, Noelle-Neumann/Mathes 1987, Jarren 1988)</xref>
          . In communication research
the actual degree of diversity is strongly debated. This also regards the desirable amount of
commonality in a modern society. Whereas a pluralistic media structure and high degrees
of content diversity has persistently been unquestioned as a presupposition of free opinion
formation and a well functioning democracy, recent developments like individualization
and the fragmentation of the audience have nurtured the fear of an increasing societal
desintegration and lead to a more critical discussion of diversity in the media system. It
does not need to be emphasized that a total uniformity between the issues and opinions in
the media is as dysfunctional as the total lack of mutuality5 (Schulz 1999, Holtz-Bacha
1997).
        </p>
        <p>
          From the perspective of media´s contribution to societal integration high degrees of
media correspondence will receive positive evaluations as they give evidence of a
minimum degree of common focus in the audience. Integration, however, is not the only
outcome of political communication processes requiring high degrees of correspondence.
Uniformity in the media system is also appreciated if it seems appropriate to put pressure
on the political system to process an issue or react to a particular concern of the public.
Media opinion can then be regarded as a substitute of public opinion which becomes a
consistent, politically effective and sociologically relevant factor only as a high level of
correspondence develops. The concept of public opinion thus more or less explicitly
includes the notion of consonance
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref7">(Gerhards/Neidhardt 1991, Neidhardt 1994,
NoelleNeumann 1982)</xref>
          . This point is well illustrated in the spiral-of-silence-approach and related
concepts referring to undesirable effects of public opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noelle-Neumann´s concept of the spiral of silence is built on the assumption that highly
consonant media content is perceived as majority opinion. This perception generates
sufficient social pressure for individuals not to dare expressing divergent opinions in
public. As a consequence the impression of the dominant opinion is reinforced and a spiral
of silence develops marginalizing opinions that are not sufficiently represented in the
media
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Noelle-Neumann 1982)</xref>
          . She sees the corresponding attention criteria, the political
uniformity of the professional peer group, the media’s reciprocal co-orientation as main
reasons for the highly consonant media messages. The mainstreaming approach developed
by Gerbner and his team (Gerbner/Gross 1976; Gerbner et al.1980, 1992, 1984) is based on
very similar assumptions. According to this approach high degrees of consonance in the
media establish social norms that more and more individuals adapt to by changing their
original attitudes and opinions into the “mainstream” opinion. Gerbner and his team see
television as the main unifying factor in modern societies producing high degrees of
conformity in people´s images of the world. The orientation towards large audiences and
the elite domination of the media are seen as the main reasons for consonant media
content. The dominant tendency is not the aggregate of all the different opinions in society:
„Rather, it is the most general, functional and stable mainstream, representing the broadest
dimensions of shared meanings and assumptions (...) this mainstream can be thought of as
a relative commonality of outlooks and values that heavy exposure to the television world
5 The antagonism between pluralism or diversity and integration is vividly reflected by the contrasting
appraisals of any given degree of correspondence in the media system. Depending on the particular
reference point high degrees of correspondence are characterized using either positive synonyms like
consent, cultural mutuality and harmony or negative synonyms like conformity, adaption, assimilation,
uniformity, standardization, stereotyping, collectivism, monopolization, and monologization. Low
degrees of correspondences are either positively labelled as diversity and pluralism or devalued as
fragmentation, heterogenization, segmentation, dissipation, atomization, specialization, individualization,
and polarization
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Knoche 1985)</xref>
          .
tends to cultivate“ (Gerbner et al. 1994, 286). Both approaches – even though developed
with opposite political backgrounds and holding different explanations for the assumed
content conformity - view high degrees of consonance in the media as threat to the
pluralistic ideal of opinion diversity and as a obstacle to social change.

      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-1-3">
        <title>3. Issues vs. positions</title>
        <p>Pluralism and press-party-parallelism on the one hand and the assumption of highly
uniform media content on the other hand lead to conflicting expectations regarding the
degree of correspondence in the media system. In spite of the controversial debates a
research tradition investigating the actual degree of consonance in the media has not
developed. The empirical efforts to assess the common issue repertoires and opinions in
the media system remained few. Except for single-issue comparisons across different
media-outlets7 there is basically no information on the general degree of correspondence in
the media system.</p>
        <p>
          Apart from those empirical shortcomings a theoretical deficit can also be observed.
There is no differentiation between issues and opinions issues. In media research high
degrees of correspondence are predominantly referred to as consonance. Consonance
includes both correspondences of issues and opinions. A terminological differentiation is
suggested in order to sharpen the analytical understanding of the construct. Consonance
will be used for the evaluative dimension. The degree of correspondence on the issue
dimension will be referred to as focusing. Thus, focusing denotes a correspondence of
issues, whereas consonance relates to a correspondence of opinion. Regarding the
formation of public opinion it is assumed that a low degree of focusing implies a
fragmentation of public opinion with highly dissipated issue agendas, whereas a lack of
consonance points to considerable conflict between different segments of society. The
partisanship might follow the established structures of the party spectrum or develop along
the groups and movements not represented in the party system. Correspondingly, the line
of conflict can be located between media with left and right party allegiances, or between
the media, the political groups and movements on the one hand and the established
political parties on the other hand. This would be the case if the positions in the media
6 The mainstreaming approach points to older Gramsci-inspired theories in the context of ideological
hegemony which see a unifying effect as a result from elite domination of the media. They structure the
ideological field, absorb and domesticate criticism. „Discrepant statements about reality are
acknowledged – but muffled, softened, blurred, fragmented, domesticated at the same time“ (Gitlin 1980,
270; also see Hallin 1987).

system develop regardless of party allegiances - for example in terms of new conflicts
between materialism and post-materialism (Fuchs 1991).
        </p>
        <p>The differentiation between issues and opinions can be related to two research
paradigms, one focusing on the issue dimension, the other one addressing the question of
corresponding opinion. The salience model considers issue selection to be the most
important aspect of party competition. In this view, it might have a larger impact on the
public’s perception of an actor’s ideological position whether or not environmental policy
is addressed by a political actor than his or her particular position on concrete policy
options. In the salience model the assignment of relevance to an issue is debated in the
context of political parties´ strategy to establish an ideological profile and position
themselves in relation to competing parties. Scholars supporting the salience model hold
that parties do not compete via different positions regarding the same issues. Rather, they
selectively emphasize certain issues, presenting them as the most relevant problems on the
political agenda. “Left-right competition can consist of attempts to assert the salience of
different issues that favor one or the other side” (Budge/Farlie 1985, 288). Applied to the
media system, the salience model implies that media outlets with different political
affinities present themselves with different issue repertoires rather than different opinions
on particular issues. It assumes that different papers will position themselves in the
political spectrum by differential relevance assignments. Different editorial positions of
media outlets should therefore be reflected by a particular issue selection and presentation
rather than through partisan arguments and evaluations. This view stands in sharp contrast
to the traditional spatial view of party competition which assumes that parties offer
different policy solutions to the same issues.</p>
        <p>The traditional view, based on Downs´ understanding of party competition, concentrates
on the political positions on an issue (Downs 1957). In liberal democracies parties
compete for the approval of the electorate by offering certain policies designed to solve
particular problems. The concept is based on a rational choice paradigm that assumes that
voters after collecting all necessary information choose the policy alternative that comes
closest to their individual needs and interests. The salience model contested this paradigm
by focusing on issue hierarchies rather than positions on particular issues, but it is an open
question whether or not particular issues are clearly linked with certain positions (Voltmer
1998/99, 72). This paper applies the assumptions of the position model of party
competition to the German media system. Rather than examining the differential issue
selection among the five quality newspapers under study, it investigates the political
positions these media outlets hold on certain issues8.</p>
        <p>
          Due to the variety of possible positions for any given issue partisanship in the media is
frequently assessed in single-issue analyse with a set of issue-specific pro and contra
arguments as indicators for media opinion. In order to assess policy preferences across the

entire spectrum of issues, however, a more abstract conceptualization of ideology is
needed. Voltmer developed a concept for the analysis of political positions in public
discourse that is sufficiently abstract to assess political positions in an all-issue study
because it uses general principles of political action
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Scarbrough 1984)</xref>
          instead of specific
policies. These principles are deductively derived from a classification of areas of political
intervention such as the economic and social system, institutional units, social groups,
individuals and the transnational surroundings9. The concept reduces the variety of
principles regarding one area of intervention to traditionally left, liberal or progressive and
traditionally right, conservative and authoritarian alternatives. Positions in this concept
thus are bipolar action-oriented alternative means to achieve political goals rather than
goals themselves.
        </p>
        <p>The concept developed by Voltmer is not only theoretically sophisticated and
convincing from an empirical perspective as it clearly differentiates between the
ideological positions of different media outlets (Voltmer 1998/99). Using this
conceptionalization it is possible to go beyond a general left-right dimension of opinion
and investigate the degree of consonance separately for each individual conflict between
fundamental alternatives. Regarding the pattern of left and right positions on those
conflicts, it can be expected that the profile of a paper with left party allegiances shows
more similarities with other liberal than with conservative papers. Also, a conservative
paper should resemble the pattern of positions of other conservative papers. It should be
interesting, however, to examine which conflicts are nevertheless evaluated
correspondingly.</p>

        <title>4. Research Design and Operationalization</title>
        <p>Focusing on editorials the notion of media competition gains special significance since
editorials provide an easy means to communicate an outlet’s particular view and address
the corresponding segments of the audience. In Germany, editorials do not represent
individual views of single journalists, but indicate the editorial stance of a media outlet.
Editorials reflect the political views of the papers and serve as a forum of presentation for
the media´s genuine view of public affairs. Since the opinion section does not have to
comply with the information function of neutral reporting, it can be expected that the
different political positions of media outlets become most visible and distinguishable in
editorials.</p>
        <p>Employing a content analysis of editorials in the five German quality newspapers
between 1994 and 1998 we investigated the political positions of the individual

unification process by Voltmer (1998/99).
newspapers and assessed the degree of consonance among them. All political editorials
were included in the analysis, with the exception of editorials on exclusively international
news without reference to domestic German politics. The coding unit was the individual
article. The analysis is based on a sample of “Die Welt”, “FAZ”, “SZ”, “FR”, and “taz” for
two quarters of each year between 1994 and 1998 starting with the second and fourth
quarter in the first year, continuing with the first and third quarter in the following year,
and switching quarters every other year. The sample was designed to include the coverage
in the fall (fourth quarter) of 1994 and 1998 when national elections were held in
Germany.</p>
        <p>In order to assess the political positions of the papers the instrument developed by
Voltmer (1998/99) was adapted and slightly modified. The basic conflicts divide into five
conflict dimensions. The first dimension, Economic Wealth and Distribution, includes five
separate conflicts representing competing – either left or right - views about the adequate
means to achieve wealth and just distribution. It includes State Intervention vs. Market
Economy, State Responsibility vs. Individual Responsibility, Demand-Side vs.
SupplySide, Tax Increase vs. Tax Reduction, and Regulation vs. Incentives (see appendix for
details). The second dimension, Institutional and Individual Autonomy, includes four basic
conflicts: Centralism vs. Autonomy, Separation vs. Unification, Need vs. Condition, and
Individual Rights vs. State Control. These conflicts relate to liberal or conservative views
on the autonomy of subsystems from the greater system. The other three conflict
dimensions Cultural Identity, Societal Integration, and External Security each include two
basic conflicts. Cultural Identity relates to the relation between “us” and “the others” and
includes Cosmopolitanism vs. Ethnocentrism and Cultural Identity vs. Integration. Societal
Integration including the conflicts Prevention vs. Sanction and Participation vs.
Representation concerns progressive and authoritarian views on integration. External
Security including the conflicts Co-operation vs. Conflict and Supra-nationalism vs.
Sovereignty refers to the alternatives of co-operative and confrontative principles in
international relations. In order to represent conflicts regarding positions toward the “new
politics” (ecology, disarmament) for which the conflicts described above do not apply an
additional conflict was developed. The left position supports the need to control possible
risks from new technologies whereas the right position stands for a preference for risk
acceptance (details in the appendix).</p>
        <p>The sample included 8,717 editorials in five newspapers over five years. For each
editorial up to three issues, three basic conflicts and three positions on these conflicts could
be coded. The issue coding scheme was composed of 45 fairly abstract issue categories10
10 In the case of our all-issue analysis over five years we were forced to move away from concrete
eventtype issue categories (restricted by time and space) and define issues on a fairly abstract level. Issues in
our coding scheme can be described as policy, politics or polity areas rather than specific controversies.
Thus, we differentiate between tax policy and legal system, but not between concrete debates or decisions
regarding those issues.
like specific policy areas (e.g. environment, foreign relations or traffic engineering) and
polity as well as politics aspects11 of the political system (like elections, political style or
parties and movements). Representing alternative policy options the basic conflicts that
could be addressed in commenting on an issue did not apply for issues regarding politics
and polity aspects rather than particular policies. Since our consonance measure relies on
the newspapers´ positions on these conflicts, only the 15,890 issues regarding policy areas
out of the total of 23,160 issues were considered for the purpose of this analysis.</p>
        <p>For every policy issue addressed in the editorials, the coders had to decide whether or
not the commentators referred to one of the 16 basic conflicts in discussing the issue. If
one of the conflicts was addressed the issue was considered to be fundamentalized since
the underlying political principles were discussed. For these issues they had to decide
whether the commentator supported the left or the right position, took an ambivalent stand
on the conflict or did not express any specific evaluation at all12. Relating basic conflicts
and the positions on these conflicts to particular issues enables us to investigate whether or
not an issue is discussed with regard to fundamental policy alternatives and which policy
alternative is supported for each issue. We can thus identify a range of conflicts referred to
in a fundamental discussion of an issue as well as the respective positions on those issues
and get a differentiated multidimensional picture of the opinions expressed in an editorial.
If an editorial deals with right wing extremism and migration e.g. the issue might either be
related to the conflict prevention vs. sanction or to cosmopolitanism vs. ethnocentrism.
Prevention vs. sanction, however, might also represent the relevant conflict in discussing
internal security. Whereas a commentator might support the sanction option regarding right
wing extremism and migration, he or she might show a preference for the prevention
principle in internal security. This illustrates that the political position expressed in an
editorial not only depends on the kind of issue, but also varies with the kind of basic
conflict the issue is related to. Consonance from this perspective does not only regard the
issue and the position on the issue, it also considers the particular conflict addressed.</p>
        <p>In assessing the degree of consonance between different papers that continuously
comment daily politics it is necessary to pay attention to the dimension of time. If a
particular paper holds a certain opinion on taxes in 1994 while another paper supports that
particular position in 1998, they both display the same opinion regarding tax policy in the
aggregate measure of the five years under study. Yet, a correspondence in the strict sense
cannot be assumed without regarding the same time period. The two papers might have
11 Politics and polity issues relate to structural and procedural aspects of the political system. They included
the following issues: Parties and Movements, Social Order, Principles of Political Action, Political Style,
Coalitions, Elections, Parliament and its Members, State and Government, Unification and German
Question, and Political Views and Ideologies.
12 If no conflict was addressed with a particular issue, “no reference” was coded. If the conflict was
addressed but the commentator did not show support for either side “no evaluation” was coded. Support
or rejection of both policy alternatives marked the ambivalent position between left and right principles
(see table 1).
expressed their opinions about two distinctly different tax-related events (or maybe even to
the same event but at a different time against a different background). Without restricting
the comparison between two newspapers to short time periods guaranteeing the same
context of current affairs, the validity of the correspondence measure has to be questioned.
After all, the notion of corresponding issue selection is based on a shared evaluation of a
policy option at a given time. Parallel judgements thus fundamentally involve the same
time reference. Corresponding positions can only be assumed if two papers support the
same principle of action at the same time.</p>
        <p>The time reference might be a day – a very strict criterion but meeting the media’s
production logic - , but can also be extended to a week thereby leaving enough time for all
the papers to develop a position on the issue. This seems to be especially appropriate for
events lasting longer than a day. This paper employs weekly measures thereby taking the
risk that two evaluations of the same issue refer to two different events in that week.
Measures on a daily basis, however, do not tolerate any time lags in coverage, severely
reduce the number of cases for comparison and thus make it almost impossible to calculate
consonance on a sound empirical basis.</p>
        <p>The degree of consonance was assessed separately for each issue by comparing the
newspapers´ positions on each of the basic conflicts addressed with the issue. Consonance
was conceptionalized as negative or inverted dissonance in the media system with the
standard deviation between the newspapers´ positions serving as dissonance measure13. A
high level of consonance is indicated by a low standard deviation (dissonance), whereas a
high standard deviation (dissonance) points to a low level of consonance.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-1-5">
        <title>5. Findings</title>
        <p>The issue frequencies varied considerably indicating differential relevance assignments by
the newspapers (table 1). Foreign and European policy, economic policy and taxes
received most attention, whereas commercial law, business promotion and infrastructure
policy were hardly commented on14.
13 For each paper and issue a mean position - the means of “left”, “ambivalent”, and “right” on the various
conflicts addressed with a given issue - had to be calculated. Thus, each paper and issue received a mean
position for every conflict that was addressed and the standard deviation was calculated among the
newspapers. In order to consider the preference of a newspaper for certain conflicts when discussing a
given issue, the conflict frequencies for each issue were used as a weight in the calculation of the
newspapers´ mean position on the issue and in the calculation of the standard deviation. This procedure resulted
in weighted weekly positions per newspaper and in weighted weekly standard deviations and then
averaged over the weeks. We are grateful to Christian Galonska who did the data analysis for this article.
14 Since issues in content analyses are categorized according to the specific research question of a project
and there is no “natural” category size for reality some issue categories include more cases than others.
Foreign policy, e.g. seems to be far more inclusive than business promotion. Yet, as long as we only
compare issue frequencies relationally (over time or between newspapers) and do not evaluate the general
level of issue diversity, any sort of categorization can be appropriate.
Table 1:</p>
        <p>Shares of positions, non-evaluative conflict references and fundamentalization15 for each issue
15 Fundamentalization marks the share all conflict references (“left”, “ambivalent” and “right” positions,
“no evaluation”) expressed in addressing an issue out of the total number of issue references. “No
reference” marks the share of issue references without addressing one of the basic conflicts.
The differential relevance assignments to particular issues have to be kept in mind when
discussing the general position of the newspapers and the degree of consonance for each
issue. In this respect, the evaluations concerning foreign and European policy have much
more potential to characterize the editorial discourse than the evaluations regarding
commercial law or business promotion.</p>
        <p>In about two thirds of the cases the issues dealt with in the editorials were related to one
of the 16 basic conflicts mentioned above. One third of the issues, however, was discussed
without reference to those policy alternatives. Instead of fundamentalizing the issue in
terms of discussing the underlying political principle, the commentators might have
focused on specific details of an event or certain aspects of the issue like the actors´
performance, the timing of an announcement or legal or historical aspects. The individual
issues showed different degrees of fundamentalization. Highly fundamentalized issues
were the social system, business promotion and alliance policy, whereas culture policy,
two German states, and defence policy were only rarely related to a basic conflict. It is
interesting to note that the most frequently addressed issues were not always the most
fundamentalized ones. The degree to which an issue can be related to a basic conflict thus
does not make it more suitable for commentary. There is no systematic relation between
the attention directed at an issue and the tendency to relate an issue to underlying
conflicts16 (Table 1, figure 1). Regarding the opinions expressed in the editorials, the
commentators showed a slight preference for the left, liberal or progressive over the right,
conservative or authoritarian policy options across all issues (23.4% vs. 20.2%)17.
Especially environment, energy, alliance and peace policy received large shares of left
evaluations (table 1, figure 1). Yet, some issues – such as taxes and business promotion
were clearly evaluated with a preference for the right. Regarding the mean positions on the
basic conflicts addressed in the editorials across all issues, we found considerable
differences among the five newspapers under study (figure 2). Results indicate that Welt
was located at the right of the left-right scale (2.4 where 1 is left and 3 is right), the FAZ
followed closely (2.3). The middle position was taken by the SZ (1.8), and the FR (1.6)
and taz marked the left pole (1.6). Considering all newspapers together there was a slight
bias to the left side of the scale indicating that the German quality press tended to take a
medium to left position on the issues at stake. The newspapers displayed considerable
distances from the extreme left and right pole rather than covering the entire political
spectrum. The distribution of the papers on the left-right continuum found on the basis of
our conceptualization of media opinion confirms former studies based on content analyses
as well as expert opinions18.
16 No linear or non-linear correlation was detected between the quantitative significance of an issue and the
degree of fundamentalization (tendency of the commentators to relate an issue to a basic conflict). The
mean position on the conflicts did not correlate with the issue frequency either.
17 In roughly 15% of the cases they did not indicate any preferences, and for 7.5% of the issues they
supported both views expressing an ambivalent position.</p>

20 The mean positions represent the average of all left, amivalent, and right positions expressed with any
kind of basic conflict addressed by a newspaper. The standard deviations for those means vary between
.82 and .89 and do not indicate severe differences in the internal pluralism of the individual newspapers.
Since the positions expressed when addressing individual issues refer to particular basic
conflicts, we can get a detailed picture about the newspapers´ positions on 16 pairs of
policy alternatives. Breaking down the political positions of the newspapers into the
individual conflicts addressed, we found distinct profiles for each paper regarding their
particular focus of concern (table 2). The left spectrum supported larger shares of left,
liberal and progressive positions in almost every basic conflict whereas the conservative
press supported larger shares of right, conservative and authoritarian positions (table 2,
figure 3). Since the newspapers did not always follow their general ideological position on
the left-right scale in every conflict, however, we identified conflicts with a tendency
towards left and conflicts with a tendency towards right evaluations. The papers clearly
tended to lean towards the left in Co-operation vs. Conflict, Supra-nationalism vs.
Sovereignty conflict, State vs. Individual Responsibility, Participation vs. Representation,
Cosmopolitanism vs. Ethnocentrism, and Control vs. Acceptance of Risk. A right
partisanship was displayed in the conflicts Tax Increase vs. Reduction, Separation vs.
Unification, and Prevention vs. Sanction (table 2, figure 3).</p>
        <p>The conservative Welt and the FAZ took a liberal stand on the two international politics
conflicts, the left wing taz and FR in turn expressed right positions regarding the questions
of unification. The typically centrist SZ went with the right spectrum in conflicts related to
economy and taxes (State Intervention vs. Market Economy, Demand-Side vs.
SupplySide, Tax Increase vs. Tax Reduction), and – like all the papers – on Centralism vs.
Autonomy. In sum, no paper exclusively held either left or right positions. A clear
cleavage, however, was found between the Welt and FAZ on the one hand and the SZ, FR
and taz on the other hand. Only in conflicts regarding economic matters the SZ deviates
from the left-wing papers21.</p>
        <p>Although the ideological profiles of the newspapers already indicate a certain degree of
conflict in the media system, they do not render statements about the parallel evaluations
of the five newspapers at a given point in time. A systematic consideration of the time
dimension lead to a conceptualization of consonance on the basis of weekly comparisons
of the newspapers´ positions for each individual issue. Considering the issue-specific
average positions of the newspapers across the weeks, we found that social, environmental,
peace, and alliance policy and European policy tended to receive high shares of left
evaluations (table 3). German unification, monetary, and tax policy, on the other hand,
were evaluated more conservatively. As already noted with regard to the newspaper
profiles on the basic conflicts, for some of the issues the newspapers deviated from their
21 Disregarding the conflicts and examining the newspapers´ positions with respect to the issues we found
almost the same pattern of differences between the papers (without table). Left papers were likely to
express left positions on most of the issues (but not on all of them) and right papers showed higher shares
of right positions on most issues (but not on all of them).
general ideological position on the left-right scale. In the area of federalism, alliance and
foreign policy the conservative newspapers even held more liberal positions than the
liberal papers22.</p>
        <p>Comparing the newspapers´ positions on the issues for each individual week, we found
the highest degree of consonance for commercial law, budgetary policy and alliance
policy23. The least consonant evaluations were received by federalism, social order and
culture policy (table 3). Still, with respect to the low quantitative significance of an issue
(table 1) we cannot predict high degrees of societal unrest related to the issues of
federalism and social system or either identify broad spheres of consensus in society on the
basis of consonant evaluations of commercial law, budgetary and alliance policy. Conflict
or consonance in the area of international politics, economy, taxes, labour and employment
and right-wing radicalism and migration are likely to be much more relevant as these
issues better reflect the character of editorial discourse.</p>
        <p>The most consonant and most dissonant issues did not attract much editorial attention.
Yet, there is no systematic relation between the issue frequencies and the level of opinion
correspondences among the newspapers24. Editorial attention does not depend on the
degree of conflict or consonance in the media system. With respect to the absolute
significance of certain issues in editorial discourse, our discussion of the degree of
consonance among the newspapers will concentrate on the issues most frequently
addressed by the commentators. Within those frequently addressed issues foreign and
European policy and education policy displayed comparably high degrees of consonance,
whereas internal security, legal policy and right wing extremism and migration showed
low degrees of consonance. Moderate degrees of consonance were found for economic
policy, taxes, labour and employment, the legal system and industrial relations policy.
Editorial discourse between 1994 to 1998 can thus be characterized by a broad coalition
among the newspapers regarding external affairs and educational matters, while issues
related to law and order and migration issues were discussed highly controversial.
22 Certain characteristics of the events taking place in the time period under study might explain these
unexpected results. During the Bosnian crisis the German left was reluctant to comply with the
expectations of the other NATO-members who wanted a stronger military engagement of Germany and
more co-operation with the NATO. Regarding this problem the left papers put forward a more isolationist
view which affected their position on the conflict Co-operation vs. Conflict. The evaluation of the
federalism issue was dominated by problems connected with the integration of the former East-German
states. Here, the left papers supported their autonomy, usually a more conservative position.
23 The degree of consonance per issue was derived from the weighted consonance measures for each basic
conflict addressed with the issue. For details of the weighting procedure see footnote 13.
24 Neither linear nor non-linear correlations could be detected.</p>
        <p>Mean positions per issue across newspapers, mean position per issue for all evaluative references
in the newspaper spectrum, and degree of dissonance among the newspapers25
25 The frequencies of each basic conflict addressed with a particular issue was used as a weight for the
calculation of the mean position for that issue. The same weighting procedure was used in the calculation
of the standard deviation among the newspapers´ issue-specific positions (also see footnote 13). N is the
number of weeks in which a particular issue is addressed. The dissonance is calculated on the basis of
weeks with more than one newspaper addressing a particular conflict with a particular issue.
Foreign Policy
If the positions on the dominant issues are broken down into the underlying conflicts that
were addressed in commenting the particular issue26, it becomes clear that each issue was
related to few main basic conflicts only (table 4)27.

27 The table only includes conflicts with more than ten cases, cases being the number of weeks where we
found positions on the conflict by at least two newspapers, so consonance could be calculated. The less
frequently addressed conflicts are not included in this table. Thus, the dissonance values and the mean
positions might deviate from the values in table 3 where all the conflicts were considered for the
assessment of dissonance.

consonance and a strong support for left positions. Prevention vs. Sanction on the contrary
which was addressed less frequently highly consonantly received right evaluations. Issues
regarding the international relations (foreign, European, alliance) were mostly addressed
with references to Co-operation vs. Conflict and Supra-nationalism vs. Sovereignty with an
above average degree of consonance and a clear preference for left positions. Issues
regarding legal matters (legal policy, legal system, and internal security) were discussed
with reference to the conflicts Prevention vs. Sanction and Individual Rights vs. State
Control. They displayed low to moderate degrees of consonance with a right tendency in
most of the conflicts. Regarding the legal system, however, individual rights were
preferred over state control, so a strong left partisanship competed with the strong
preference for sanction rather than prevention. Issues regarding economic aspects (labour
and employment, industrial relations, economic policy) evolved around the conflicts State
Intervention vs. Market Economy, Demand vs. Supply Side, State vs. Individual
Responsibility, Regulation vs. Incentives, and Centralism vs. Autonomy. They showed low
degrees of consonance and a clear preference for right positions, except for the conflict
State vs. Individual Responsibility in the Labour and Employment issue where the
commentators clearly attributed responsibility to the state. Education and tax policy were
related to one main conflict only and showed low levels of consonance. Commentators on
education policy showed a slight tendency to support the right position in the conflict
Centralism vs. Autonomy. Regarding the tax issue they showed a strong support for the
right position of tax reduction.</p>

      <sec id="sec-1-6">
        <title>6. Summary and Discussion</title>
        <p>The analysis examined the political positions of five German quality newspapers on policy
issues addressed in their editorials. Employing a content analytical instrument that
conceptionalized positions as abstract preferences for fundamental alternatives of political
action it was possible to assess the ideological profiles of the newspapers in terms of left or
right partisanship regarding 16 basic conflicts and identify spheres of conflict and
consensus in editorial discourse. The general political positions of the papers confirmed
former studies of the German newspaper spectrum with the FAZ and Welt located on the
right hand side of the scale, the FR and taz located on the left, and the SZ taking the middle
position.</p>
        <p>Although we found clear cut cleavages between left and right newspapers the
evaluations by the commentators did not always follow the newspapers´ general
ideological position on all the issues and with regard to all the conflicts. That means the
positions expressed by the newspapers varied considerably across the issues. Especially
issues regarding external relations, some aspects of the social question, and environment
can be regarded as issues with a tendency for left partisanship. Most economic and
financial matters as well as German unification, on the other hand, seemed to be
predominantly discussed from a conservative perspective. For some issues the ideological
positions of the newspapers even contradicted our expectations. A left bias regarding
international politics displayed by the conservative papers was paralleled by a right bias on
questions of German unification that was shown by the liberal newspapers.</p>
        <p>In sum, liberal and conservative papers displayed surprisingly corresponding positions
on some issues, while they strongly disagreed on others. Regarding the most frequently
addressed issues only external relations and education were commented on with
comparably consonant positions while most other issues - especially legal matters and
migration - were controversially debated. The results represent strong evidence for the
position model of left-right competition. Newspapers with opposite political positions take
conflicting positions on given issues. Since there was only limited parallel issue selection
in any given week, however, the consonance could only be assessed for few issues in few
weeks. Even without separately testing the salience model29, the difficulties calculating the
consonance measure with only few weeks of parallel issue selections already indicates that
newspapers do in fact differ in terms of relevance assignment. They do not routinely
address the same issues in a given week but rather emphasize certain issues that their
competitors do not assign relevance to. Thus, the salience model is not at all rejected by
our results. Instead, both models seem to apply. Newspapers compete through differential
relevance assignment but also hold different positions on the issues that nevertheless are
correspondingly addressed.</p>
        <p>As there is no normative optimum of consonance and conflict in the media, we can only
speculate on the implications of our findings for the pluralistic ideal on the one hand and
the integration potential of media on the other hand. The relatively low degrees of
consonance detected in this analysis, however, do not seem to represent a severe danger to
democracy and do not point to a completely mainstreamed media opinion. As some issues
still marked consensual spheres there is no evidence of a general cleavage between the left
and right newspaper spectrum pointing to a high level of desintegration.</p>
        <p>Regarding the question of differential relevance assignment to particular issues, our
findings disappointed some common expectations. There is no causal relationship between
the quantitative relevance of an issue and the degree of conflict or consonance: Issues
discussed highly controversial among the five newspapers do not necessarily attract much
editorial attention in a given week. Even though conflict between certain actors has proved
to be a highly efficient news factor, the degree of conflict between different newspapers
29 The salience model was tested in a previous article (see Eilders 2000).
does not result in high levels of media attention. Neither are highly consensual issues likely
to be addressed more frequently. We found no evidence that the media in their editorials
direct attention to consonant issues calling to mind the spheres of consensus in society and
thereby enhancing integration. As fundamentalization and the mean position of an issue
have not prooved to be good predictors for media attention either, it seems to depend on
certain inherent characteristics of issues and concrete political events rather than on the
media opinion and the constellations of opinion in the media system whether or not an
issue receives editorial attention.</p>

      <title>The State Intervention vs. Market Economy Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to the relation of the state and the economic subsystem. It centers
around the question to what extent the state should intervene in economic processes. One
answer to the question emphasizes the importance of the market, the other answer stresses
state intervention.</p>
      <p>State intervention:
The emphasis is on state intervention and the creation of a mixed economy is called for.
Uncontrolled market forces are assumed to end in imbalances with unintended economic as
well as social consequences. Therefore, state intervention in economic processes is
considered necessary. Sometimes, the state itself becomes an economic entrepreneur.
Market economy:
The emphasis is on market forces. It is assumed that the market is capable of structuring
the economic and social conditions of economic processes effectively. Economic activity
of the state is considered ineffective. Thus, state intervention is rejected and the
privatization of state enterprises is encouraged.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>The State Responsibility vs. Individual Responsibility Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to different principles of responsibility in the relationship between
state and society. The question is who is responsible for evening out social inequalities.
Answers to this question are of particular importance for welfare policies. Individual
responsibility and state responsibility are distinguished as policy positions.
State responsibility:
The emphasis is on the responsibility of the state or collective agencies to provide goods
and services to even out social inequalities and fulfil individual needs. The assignment of
state responsibility is usually associated with a tendency to institutionalize social rights.
Individual responsibility:
This principle is often referred to as the subsidiary principle (Subsidiaritätsprinzip). It
emphasizes the responsibility of the individual or social groups and social organizations
(e.g. family, neighbourhood, churches) for all tasks they can reasonably take upon
themselves. Only if the solution of a problem exceeds the resources of the individual or
social group, higher level groups or organizations and finally the state are supposed to act.
The principle of individual responsibility is usually associated with a political tendency to
cut back government activity in society.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>The Demand-Side vs. Supply-Side Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to monetary and fiscal policies of the state. The question is in which
direction state intervention into income distribution has to be done. A supply-side position
and a demand-side position are distinguished.</p>
      <p>Demand-side orientation:
The goal is on supporting consumers (private households) in the market process. It is
assumed that strengthening the "effective demand" will result in a stronger supply-side.
Demand-side oriented policies center on measures to increase private income, e.g. by
programs for employment and improving workforce quality. All welfare aid that improves
income (e.g. unemployment benefits, child allowances) can also be regarded as elements of
demand-side oriented policies.</p>
      <p>Supply-side orientation:
The goal is on supporting investment activities of private economic actors. It is assumed
that in the first place the supply-side should be supported. As a result, consumers would
also be strengthened. Supply-side oriented policies focus on the improvement of conditions
for private enterprises. Main instruments are the reduction of taxes, wages, and
entrepreneurial risks.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>The Tax Increase vs. Tax Reduction Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to the resources of the government budget. The question is to what
extent the state should burden the economy and private incomes in order to fulfil its tasks.
This conflict was sharpened by the challenges resulting from the reconstruction of East
Germany after unification.</p>
      <p>Tax increase:
The state is regarded as responsible for a wide variety of public - tasks which necessarily
require extensive financial resources. Besides the classical tasks of the state like the
guarantee of internal and external security, other tasks such as welfare, education and
infrastructure are also seen as in the scope of its responsibility.</p>
      <p>Tax reduction:
The scope of state tasks is defined restrictively. The state should confine itself to the
classical tasks, while goals like education, infrastructure and parts of welfare are assigned
to private organisations. High taxes are considered as an obstruction of economic growth
and private initiative, resulting in inflation and unemployment.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>The Regulation vs. Incentives Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to the political instruments aimed to influence economic or social
behavior, especially in the areas of labour market and environmental protection, which
create enormous deficits and where the means of problem-solving are highly disputed. The
policy positions here are regulation and incentives.</p>
      <p>Regulation:
A particular behavior is regulated by binding norms. The typical instrument of regulation is
the law.</p>
      <p>Incentives:
A particular behaviour is encouraged by the state by providing incentives. This policy
position relies on economic incentives to bring about a desired behaviour (rewards) and on
economic disincentives to block undesirable behaviour (duties). It is up to the individual to
observe incentives or disincentives or to accept the consequences.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>The Centralism vs. Autonomy Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension points to different conceptions of how the relationship between the central
state and its diverse sub-units should be organized. In particular, it applies to federalism
and the degree of autonomy cultural organizations, such as mass media and churches, or
economic organizations, such as employers and trade unions, should have. The positions of
autonomy and centralism are distinguished.</p>
      <p>Centralism:
The emphasis is on the strengthening and expansion of the central state's rights and power
with respect to the smaller sub-units. This policy position accords the central state a
dominant role. The central state pursues this goal by making use of his main resources,
Legislation and distribution of money.</p>
      <p>Autonomy:
The emphasis is on the smaller units' rights and autonomy with respect to the central state
or the role of the federal government. The autonomy position stresses that sub-units should
act on the basis of their own resources and their own decision making.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>The Separation vs. Unification Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to the relation between the two parts of Germany, especially after
the breakdown of socialism. The dimension refers not only to inter-state relations, but also
to the relation between organizations (interest groups, parties) that then existed in both
parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Separation:
The (partial) autonomy of the two parts of Germany and its institutions is stressed. The
goal is a confederation of the two German states, at least the persistence of East German
institutions. Sometimes the demand is merely to postpone national or institutional
unification.</p>
      <p>Unification:
The national unity is regarded as the highly valued and preferred structure. Unification at
all levels is demanded as fast as possible. The persistence of institutions of the former
GDR is rejected.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>The Need vs. Condition Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to how the differences in terms of wealth and power between East
and West Germany can be reduced. The alternatives indicate different modes of the
transfer of resources from the West to the East.</p>
      <p>Need:
The transfer of resources is defined by the needs of East Germany. Money, manpower and
know-how are transferred. A further demand is to share political power. The support by the
West is considered as a matter of national solidarity.</p>
      <p>Condition:
Support and transfer are only given when certain conditions the reconstruction of
institutions and the implementation of market economy, are met. In particular, political
power is only shared when the East German politicians have proved their integrity.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>The Individual Rights vs. State Control Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension points to the tension between individual and society. The problem is how
to ensure the cohesion of the society which is made up of many individuals. One answer to
this problem stresses individual rights, the other emphasizes state control.
Individual Rights:
This position assumes that the individual is able to choose the "right way" without
endangering the rights of other individuals and the interests of the community. The
individual should get the chance for self-determination. The individual has to be protected
from the state and social pressure for conformity. The individual is regarded as responsible
and rational.</p>
      <p>State control:
The assumption is that the pursuit of individual rights and interests tends to violate the
common interest. Thus, the individual has to fit into society and has to accept customs,
norms, rules, duties and his or her particular role, even if this would run counter one's own
needs and goals.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-11">
      <title>The Cosmopolitanism vs. Ethnocentrism Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to the relationship to foreign cultures and ethnic groups outside the
society. It also captures the degree to which the own culture and the own people should be
favoured in domestic legislation. Ethnocentrism and cosmopolitanism are distinguished as
policy positions.</p>
      <p>Cosmopolitanism:
The emphasis is on the equal value of different cultures and nations ("opening"). This
policy position rests on universalistic values and pluralism. Possibilities of immigration are
regarded liberally.</p>
      <p>Ethnocentrism:
The emphasis is on the superiority and priority of the own culture and nation ("closure").
The ethnocentrist position draws from the conviction that one's own culture and norms are
of more value than others. But even without such an evaluation, one makes a clear
distinction between one's own group and foreign groups. Possibilities of immigration are
interpreted restrictively.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-12">
      <title>The Cultural Identity vs. Integration Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to how to handle culturally and ethnically different groups in the
society. Should groups be encouraged to keep their cultural identity (multiculturalism) or
should they be encouraged to assimilate? In this context, in Germany, problems have
arisen, particularly with the guest-workers. Presently, it has gained new importance with
the opening of the borders, both within the EC and with the Eastern countries. Further, it
refers to the situation in the reunified Germany where people with different experiences,
values, styles of life and economic conditions live together.</p>
      <p>Cultural identity:
The emphasis is on the originality, identity and the specific rights of different cultures and
ethnic groups living together. Cultural identity means that culturally different groups live
together in a community, but each wants and is granted to preserve its own cultural
particularities. The diversity of culturally and ethnically different groups is considered to
be a valuable addition for societal life. This might also find its expression in rights and
institutions.</p>
      <p>Integration:
The emphasis is on the necessity of cultural adaptation and integration into the dominant
culture in order to make living together possible. Integration takes place culturally
(adaptation to values, styles of life, language), socially (similarity of socio-economic
conditions), and formally (legislation). Integration is regarded as a precondition for full
participation in political, economic and social affairs of the host culture.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-13">
      <title>The Prevention vs. Sanction Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to the question of which instruments should be used to prevent
deviant behaviour (e.g. crime) and to guarantee law and order. The main policy area of this
dimension is penal Legislation and law enforcement. The positions of sanction and
prevention are distinguished.</p>
      <p>Prevention:
This policy position emphasizes preventive measures to counteract deviant behaviour.
There is the conviction that circumstances can be altered in a way to prevent deviant or
criminal behaviour. The solution to deviant behaviour is seen in changing societal
conditions. Thus, ultimately the society is responsible for a successful socialization.
Sanction:
The emphasis is on authoritative acts to punish deviant behaviour. The functions of
punishment arc both atonement and deterrence. It is assumed that deviant behaviour can be
controlled by threat of punishment. Thus, higher crime rates are usually responded to by
heavier sanctions.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-14">
      <title>The Participation vs. Representation Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to the relationship between the citizen and the political system. The
question is to what extent the citizens should participate in political decisions. The policy
positions on this dimension are representation and participation.</p>
      <p>Participation:
The emphasis is on the right of the citizen to participate and have a direct say in ongoing
policy decisions. The underlying principle is an extensive model of democracy. The goal is
to extend the possibilities and the modes of participation. Beyond voting in elections,
direct modes of participation, such as referenda and plebiscites, are approved. Further,
democratic participation should include as many areas of society as possible (e.g.
economy, community planning). The extension of participation rights to segments of the
population that did not have these rights before (e.g. blacks, guest-workers) is also part of
this dimension.</p>
      <p>Representation:
The emphasis is on representative democratic procedures which imply an indirect
participation of citizens in political decision making. Instead, the role and the functions of
the elected representatives are stressed. The underlying principle is a procedural model of
democracy. According to this concept, citizen participation should be mainly restricted to
voting, i.e. establishing government majorities. After this, binding decisions are taken by
the elected representatives.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-15">
      <title>The Co-operation vs. Conflict Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to general principles of international relations. It covers bilateral
foreign politics as well as the two main international conflicts, namely the East-West
conflict and the North-South conflict. We distinguish two policy positions, conflict and
cooperation.</p>
      <p>Co-operation:
The state emphasizes shared interests and joint action with other states. With respect to the
East-West conflict, policies of detente and co-operation are pursued. Strategies are arms
reduction or action according to CSCE-procedures. With respect to the North-South
conflict, the necessity of solidarity and international responsibility is being stressed.
Conflict:
The state emphasizes its own national interests and puts these interests first. In the pursuit
of its goals it accepts conflict with other states as a means of politics. Confrontation is a
characteristic state of the Cold War.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-16">
      <title>The Supra-nationalism vs. Sovereignty Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to the specific way relations to other states arc to be organized. It
centers on the question of whether and to what extent sovereign rights should be delegated
to supranational or international organizations. The most important organizations for the
current process of internationalization are the UNO, the NATO, and the EC. The respective
positions are labelled sovereignty and supra-nationalism.</p>
      <p>Supra-nationalism:
The necessity of international and supranational organizations is emphasized. The state is
ready to delegate rights from the nation-state to supranational organizations. The rights of
supranational organizations should be expanded and strenghthened.</p>
      <p>Sovereignty:
The state insists on sovereign rights and endeavours to maintain the structures of a
nationstate. There is a resistance to the delegate of rights to supranational organizations, a
tendency to restrain the power of these organizations, or slow down the process of
internationalization.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-17">
      <title>New: The Control of New Technologies vs. Acceptance of Risk Dimension</title>
      <p>This dimension refers to the conflict regarding “new politics” that mostly evolves around
environmental and human biology issues. It centers on the question how the technological
development should be organized and whether and to what extent possible negative
outcomes of new technologies should be accepted or whether the state should be more
sceptical toward new developments. The respective positions are labelled Control of New
Technologies vs. Acceptance of Risk Dimension.
Control of New Technologies:
A preference for control and for the consideration of ecological and social consequences of
technical developments.</p>
      <p>Acceptance of Risk:
Technological innovation is given priority over the possibility of negative outcomes for
ecology and society.</p>
