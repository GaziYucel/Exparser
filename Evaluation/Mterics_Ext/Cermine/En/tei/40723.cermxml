      <title>Analysis</title>
      <p>Interim governments are often installed during peace processes, and policy makers
tend to portray them as magic bullets that are capable of resolving all forms of violent
conflict and promoting postconflict democracy. Their record, however, is mixed. This
is partly because policy makers focus on distributing interim government seats among
conflict parties. It is just as vital, though, to ensure that interim governments implement
crucial reforms and integrate civil society in decision-making processes.</p>
      <p>Among the most vital reforms interim governments need to implement is the
integration of the parallel institutions that warring parties maintain during armed
conlfict. As long as parties retain control over military structures or shadow
administrations, they will possess the resources to return to fighting.</p>
      <p>How interim governments are perceived by the broader public is also important.
Including civil society in decision making, such as when drafting a new electoral law,
increases the acceptance of reforms.

        <title>Interim Governments as Tools for Conflict</title>
        <p>Resolution
When promoting peace and democratization in
societies marked by internal violence, the
international community often calls for the installation
of interim governments. Interim governments are
institutions set in place to facilitate the transition
from an old regime to a new one, organize
democratic elections, provide venues for conflict
resolution for the warring parties, and implement
crucial institutional reforms early on in the peace
process. They often convene after warring parties
have signed a peace agreement, but they can
also form while fighting is still taking place. Interim
governments typically cease to function with the
holding of elections so that a new, “permanent”
government can take over. Figure 1 shows that
interim governments were common in postconflict
peace processes all over the world between 1989
and 2012. This has been particularly evident in
sub-Saharan Africa, where interim governments
were installed following over 60 percent of armed
conflicts, including civil wars in Burundi,
Liberia, and the Central African Republic (CAR).
Interim governments were also set up after roughly
50 percent of armed conflicts in Europe, the
Middle East, South America and Central America as
well as after about 25 percent of armed conflicts
in Asia.</p>
        <p>
          Policy makers, warring parties, and the
media have thus recently started to increasingly
portray interim governments as “magic bullets”
capable of resolving all forms of violent conflict. For
instance, in June 2012 the then US Secretary of
State, Hillary Clinton, stressed the need to create
“a fully representative and inclusive interim
government which leads to free and fair elections” in
Syria
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(The Telegraph 2012)</xref>
          . In the final years of Sri
Lanka’s civil war that ended in 2009, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) demanded the
creation of an internationally backed interim
selfgoverning authority, but the government denied
them such a request. And recently commenting on
Afghanistan’s current struggle for peace, Foreign
Policy identified a new interim government even
as “the only choice left”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Koskinas 2014)</xref>
          for the
country. Such a cure-all view on interim
governments is, however, somewhat paradoxical. While
they may help to resolve conflict in some cases,
they also raise questions regarding the democratic
legitimacy of and impunity for actors involved in
the conduct of war:
• First, interim governments are typically
unelected and thus democratically illegitimate
institutions that are put in place to promote
democracy, a system that thrives on elections to
determine its political leaders. Interim
governments have hence also been called “benevolent
autocrats”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Chesterman 2004)</xref>
          .
  Source: &lt;www.ucdp.uu.se&gt; for conflict data; own compilation of data for interim gov ernments.
• Second, interim governments are also regularly
perceived as bridges to peace and conflict
resolution, but they are usually dominated by those
actors that started the war in the first place. It
is not rare for the warring parties’ leaders, who
are often inexperienced in governing a state, to
exploit their positions in interim governments
to enrich themselves, instead of generating
collective goods for the benefit of all members of
society.
        </p>
        <p>Despite these paradoxes, interim governments
were also frequently put in place in 2014. In
Ukraine the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych’s
regime in February after prolonged protests in
Kiev’s Independence Square brought an interim
government to power that was ruled by the
former opposition parties. Despite being in place
until Petro Poroshenko was elected president in
May 2014, the interim government did not resolve
Ukraine’s lingering political conflict. In March
2014, after an internationally unrecognized
independence referendum and a Russian
intervention, Russia recognized the Crimean Peninsula as
a sovereign state. Shortly thereafter, violence
escalated into a civil war in Ukraine’s eastern oblasts.</p>
        <p>In the Central African Republic (CAR) a
national transitional council was installed in January
2014 after a prolonged armed conflict between the
Séléka coalition and supporters of former
president Francois Bozizé. Catherine Samba-Panza, the
mayor of the capital Bangui, became interim
president. These political changes did not, however,
resolve the country’s conflict, and United Nations
(UN) troops were required to take over the
peacekeeping mission in September 2014 in an atempt
to stop the continued bloodshed. In South Sudan
the May 2014 peace accord called for the creation
of an interim government. But peace talks were
at a standstill as of October 2014 because warring
party leaders have been unable to agree on
interim cabinet positions. And in Thailand the army
set up a military interim government after
overthrowing Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s
regime in May 2014. Military rulers have
promised political reforms and democratic elections,
though they are yet to materialize.</p>
        <p>The record for all of these 2014 interim
governments in promoting sustainable peace and
democracy is thus mixed at best. When are interim
governments instruments for peace and democracy?
And when do they fail to keep their promises?</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>The Institutional Design of Interim Governments</title>
      <p>Thus far, political science has almost exclusively
analyzed the institutional designs of interim
governments by assessing how these bodies add to
postconflict peace and democracy. This is based
on an influential typology that identifies which
political elite actors dominate interim
governments and diferentiates between four
institutional designs: caretaker, revolutionary,
power-sharing and international.</p>
      <p>Caretaker interim governments are ruled by the
incumbent regime’s authoritarian elites. This was
the case in Angola, for instance, where the
incumbent People’s Movement for the Liberation of
Angola (MPLA) were in power during the
transitional period between the signing of the Bicesse Peace
Agreement in 1991 and presidential elections in
1992. The rebels of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) were not
included.</p>
      <p>If a regime is defeated by an opposition
party, however, the later may install a revolutionary
interim government – as occurred in Libya in 2011.
There Muammar Gaddafi’s regime was
overthrown by the rebel-ruled National Transitional
Council (NTC), which organized elections for the
General National Congress in July 2012.</p>
      <p>
        In a power-sharing interim government,
incumbent and new elites join forces, as was the case
after Liberia’s long-lasting civil war in 2003. And in
an international interim government, international
actors (commonly through the lead of the UN)
assume political authority for a period of time – an
example of which is the establishment of the UN
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo at the
turn of the millennium
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Shain and Linz 1995)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The record shows that power-sharing and
international forms of interim governments (such
as those in Liberia and Kosovo, respectively) are
more successful in promoting postconflict peace
and democratization than are caretaker and
revolutionary designs (like those set up in
Angola and Libya, respectively), which exclude one of
the warring factions. This is because, among
other things, interim power sharing ofers all relevant
warring party leaders a position in political ofice
and thus assures them that they will not be
dominated or marginalized in the peace process.
Furthermore, a seat in an interim cabinet or
parliament is at times viewed to be more lucrative than
is continuing to fight for political power on the
batlefield. For instance, Foday Sankoh, leader of
Sierra Leone’s Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
rebel movement, is said to have signed the 1999
Lomé Peace Agreement in exchange for the vice
presidency and control over the national diamond
trade
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Binningsbø and Dupuy 2009)</xref>
        . Interim rule
in Sierra Leone ended with elections in May 2002,
and civil war has not recurred. In Angola, on the
other hand, UNITA received no seats in the
caretaker interim government and thus had no reason
to believe that the government could deliver free
and fair elections. After UNITA’s Jonas Savimbi
lost to José Eduardo dos Santos of the MPLA in
the 1992 presidential elections, the rebels
remobilized for civil war.
      </p>
      <p>While power-sharing interim governments can
thus often lure warring factions into peace by
offering certain benefits, international interim
governments come instead with capacity or
coercion. Due to their greater technical knowledge as
well as financial and human resources, UN
interim governments (“transitional administrations”)
are, in theory, often beter equipped than
internally conflictual power-sharing interim governments
to rebuild state institutions. International interim
governments also often possess suficient military
manpower via peacekeeping missions to ensure
warring parties comply. For example,
international authority has prevented the recurrence of civil
war in Bosnia, where the Ofice of the High
Representative is allowed to dismiss domestic leaders
from political ofice if they are seen to be pursuing
an ethnonationalist agenda.</p>
      <p>The Bosnian case, however, points to
problematic aspects of international interim rule that
are often dismissed as illegitimate, undemocratic
or neocolonial forms of postconflict governance.
Furthermore, UN administrations typically sufer
from operational deficiencies such as being very
slow to deploy and lacking the necessary cultural
and/or linguistic skills to rule a foreign territory.
Also, international interim governments are often
criticized for imposing Western ideas of
democracy in postconflict societies in the Global South
– particularly in cases where reforms are
implemented with low levels of local ownership over
the process. For instance, the UN administration
established in East Timor in 1999 did not
initially intend assign any executive or legislative
power to the East Timorese political elites. Only in
August 2000, after political elites protested against
the lack of influence they had over East Timor’s
transition to independence, did the UN create the
East Timor Transitional Administration (ETTA)
– a body that represented the structure of East
Timor’s government following the cessation of the
interim government.</p>
      <p>
        These issues already point to the many
challenges faced by international interim
governments. But power-sharing interim governments
also have to deal with dificulties. In fact, many
power-sharing interim regimes installed between
1989 and 2012 failed to deliver sustainable peace
and democratization (e.g., the Democratic
Republic of the Congo [DRC] and Burundi). Although
there are many reasons for this, one explanation
suggests that power-sharing interim governments
are seen to reward the use of violence with a seat
in political ofice, which then motivates formerly
unarmed groups to take up arms in order to
also receive a seat in interim government
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Tull and
Mehler 2005)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Another problem with focusing on power
sharing and internationalization as the key reasons for
interim governments’ success or failure is that
while these factors may be strong explanations of
short-term peace, they often cannot explain
longterm, sustainable peace or postconflict
democratization. For instance, if power-sharing interim
governments contribute to peace by ofering
warring parties interim cabinet seats, what happens
once elections take place and a new, postinterim
government takes over? It is likely that the
former interim governors will refuse to accept being
stripped of political power and relegated to the
opposition, thus threatening to return to war. This
was, in fact, what occurred in Cambodia
following the defeat of Hun Sen, the leader of the
Cambodian People’s Party (CPP), by Prince Norodom
Ranariddh in the 1993 elections. After two years as
prime minister of the power-sharing, interim
Supreme National Council, Hun Sen and the CPP
refused to accept defeat and forced their way into
a coalition government with Ranariddh – a move
made possible by the fact that the CPP had never
relinquished control of the security services and
also controlled civil administration structures in
much of rural Cambodia.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Institutional Reforms in Interim Governments</title>
      <p>Because of the aforementioned issues, it would be
fruitful to take into account explanations of the
success or failure of interim governments that go
beyond the presence of power sharing or
international actors. Just as important as the “static”
institutional design of interim governments are the
“dynamic” features of these governments (i.e., the
type of reforms that they conduct). The
Cambodia example shows how crucially important it is
to address early on in a peace process the
parallel political and military institutions that warring
parties create or maintain during armed conflict.
In fact, in most armed conflicts today warring
factions establish more or less institutionalized and
militarized “shadow governments” in order to
accumulate the resources needed to engage in war.
Together with nonstatutory rebel armies, these
parallel structures do not automatically
disappear just because, for instance, a peace agreement
is signed and an interim government is installed.
Even in cases like Kosovo, where the mass exodus
of Serbian bureaucratic personnel led to an
institutional vacuum in the formal state structures
after the end of the war, informal Albanian-run
parallel institutions had long been in place –
namely, a shadow government run (for over a decade)
by the unarmed opposition party, the
Democratic League of Kosovo, and a self-proclaimed
interim government run by the Kosovo Liberation
Army (and set up before the UN installed its own
interim administration in June 1999).</p>
      <p>Thus during a peace period, interim
governments must promptly look to integrate the parallel
political and military institutions of warring
parties. These institutions enable such factions to
remain organized and tax a population, which
provides them with finances to purchase weapons in
the event they lose elections and decide to prevent
their political elimination by force. In the
abovementioned case of Angola, for instance, UNITA
never allowed the MPLA caretaker interim
government access to its districts, therefore
preventing electoral registration being carried out in these
areas. Wherever the interim government tried to
expand its territorial outreach in UNITA
strongholds, UNITA rebels atacked and/or kidnapped
government oficials, thus forcing them to cancel
their electoral registration eforts. When UNITA’s
Savimbi lost the 1992 elections to the MPLA’s de
Santos, he was able to quickly regroup his party
– primarily in the communes and municipalities
that UNITA had never handed over to the interim
government. Similarly, in Cambodia the 1991
Paris Peace Agreement did not require a strong
commitment by the warring parties to disband their
military structures, but rather only that the
factions agreed to disarm and demobilize before or
shortly after the elections and to abide by the
decisions of the subsequently elected government.
But these terms were never strongly enforced, and
the disarmament process was never completed.
Consequently, not only was Hun Sen able to force
his way into power despite losing the 1993
election, but Khmer Rouge rebels were able to
continue their struggle against Hun Sen’s government
until 1998.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the reforms implemented in Nepal
demonstrate how an interim government’s
monopolization of power can increase its impact on
postconflict peace. During Nepal’s ten-year-long
civil war, the Maoist rebels controlled up to 75
percent of the national territory. They used their
strongholds to set up people’s courts and
people’s governments, to extract taxes from the
rural population, and to force villagers to provide
insurgents with food and accommodation. When
the Maoists signed Nepal’s Comprehensive Peace
Agreement in November 2006, they agreed to
disband their parallel structures upon joining the
interim institutions. The new inclusive interim
parliament convened in January 2007, and a complete
dissolution of the people’s courts and
governments was reported for February the same year.
Although the subsequent peace process in Nepal
had and still has to overcome many obstacles (e.g.,
a thorough reform of the country’s security
sector is necessary), the country has thus far not
returned to civil war.</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>Elite Afairs and More Inclusive Processes</title>
        <p>The role of interim governments is not solely to
afect the behavior and perceptions of the leaders
of warring parties. Equally important is how they
engage the broader public, especially civil society
organizations, in postconflict societies. The
inclusion of the public in processes of institutional
reform (e.g., amending the constitution or drafting
new electoral laws) can widen the acceptance of
such reforms and increase their sustainability and
legitimacy. For those people or groups that have
been excluded from a reform process conducted
by an elite few or marginalized by the decisions
of interim leaders, violent revolt may become a
legitimate strategy to stop or reverse such
processes and decisions. Therefore, interim governments
that consult with civil society during reform
processes are likely to be more successful in
contributing to sustainable peace and durable
democratization than are interim governments that are mere
elite afairs.</p>
        <p>We can see this, for example, in Afghanistan
after the US-led international intervention in 2001.
The Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) was put in
place by the December 2001 Bonn Agreement.
The AIA, under the guidance of President Hamid
Karzai, was charged with drafting the country’s
new post-Taliban constitution and electoral law.
But although the institutions of the AIA included
a broad spectrum of Afghanistan’s ethnic and
social groups, the lawmaking process was
essentially closed to broader and inclusive public debate.
The AIA presented the electoral law to the
population largely as a done deal and was
consequently perceived as mostly serving the interests of the
interim power brokers. On the contrary, the 2003–
2005 National Transitional Government in Liberia
allocated posts not only to the former ruling
National Patriotic Party (NPP) and the rebel groups
Liberians United for Reconciliation and
Democracy (LURD) and Movement for Democracy in
Liberia (MODEL), but also to other political parties
and civil society groups. Instead of a rebel
leader, Gyude Bryant, a civilian and businessman, was
named interim president. Even though this
constitutes a much more comprehensive and seemingly
sustainable institutional reform process than that
in Afghanistan, it also proved dificult for civil
society members in Liberia to serve both as formal
representatives in the interim bodies and to
perform their roles as watchdogs over the political
process.</p>

      <title>Interim Governments and German Foreign</title>
      <p>Policy
What conclusions can be drawn from the above
discussion for the interim governments installed
(and those yet to be convened) in 2014? And what
recommendations can be made for German and
international policy makers that are likely to
promote interim governments to help resolve future
armed conflicts?</p>
      <p>In Ukraine the outbreak of violence may have
been prevented if the interim government had not
been presented as a political “clean break” with
the former regime. An original plan for the
transition of Ukraine proposed by German foreign
minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his
counterparts from Poland and France included a
powersharing interim government of national unity that
would have been composed of both the
opposition and members of Viktor Yanukovych’s regime.</p>
      <p>Instead, the regime was toppled, and the
opposition’s interim government (atempting to reform
the civil administration) swiftly dismissed a
number of long-seated bureaucrats and tried to impose
a bill that aimed to make Ukrainian the sole state
language – threatening Russian-speaking
Ukrainians in the country’s eastern oblasts, which were
Yanukovych strongholds. A more inclusive
transition process that had beter taken into
consideration voices from eastern Ukraine would have
added to national reconciliation.</p>
      <p>The above discussion also shows that
power sharing alone often cannot explain the success
or failure of interim governments. In South
Sudan warring party leaders signed a peace accord
in May 2014. These leaders, however, continue
today to fight over cabinet posts, with each warring
faction stressing its right to lead the interim
government. Similarly, the change in the CAR’s
stafing policy that came with Catherine
Samba-Panza’s appointment as interim president in January
2014 did not change the situation on the ground:
violence remains a daily threat in the country.</p>
      <p>Equally important to the question of who runs the
interim government is what reforms the interim
government implements. Both Salva Kiir, current
president of South Sudan, and Catherine
Samba-Panza addressed the UN General Assembly
in September 2014 to appeal to the member states
to strengthen the UN peacekeeping operations in
their respective countries – in part because
interim governments require substantial
international support to disarm and demobilize combatants.</p>
      <p>In the CAR the interim government is becoming
meaningless outside the capital Bangui. It has no
control of the country’s North, where former
president Michel Am-Nondokro Djotodia has formed
a parallel government in the city of Birao. The
experience of Angola (as discussed above) rendered
a reform process unlikely and impeded the
holding of elections (as currently planned) in
February 2015, not least because electoral registration
requires control over the national territory.</p>
      <p>Lastly, in Thailand the interim National
Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) of Prime Minister
Prayuth Chan-ocha, and then head of the army,
was criticized in September 2014 in an Amnesty
International report that accused it of systematic
human rights violations. The allegations include
arbitrary arrests and the restriction of freedom of
expression and assembly. Amnesty
International claims that such restrictions are unfavorable to
an inclusive institutional reform process as well as
national reconciliation. The situation in Thailand
is that without consulting civil society in the
institutional reform process, Thailand’s interim
leaders are risking a hard landing: not only will
reforms not supported by civil society be
unsustainable, but an exclusive interim period might
promote further unrest in the country.</p>
      <p>In general, international actors engaged in
postconflict democracy promotion and
peacebuilding have in the past often paid much
atention to distributing seats in the interim
government among political leaders. This is, however,
often not enough to ensure that an interim
government succeeds in securing long-term peace and
sustainable democracy. German and
international policy makers should therefore strive to equip
interim governments with the capacity to
complete much-needed reforms before elections take
place – for instance, by supporting UN
peacekeeping missions that can help to disarm and
demobilize rebel groups. Furthermore, civil society actors
and unarmed opposition parties should be given
stronger roles in interim governments. The
example of Liberia, however, where such actors have
even been rewarded with seats in the interim
parliament, shows that such inclusion may not
always be the best approach. Instead, policy
makers could encourage interim governments to allow
for public debates and implement transparent
reform processes by, for example, holding referenda
on newly drafted constitutions.
