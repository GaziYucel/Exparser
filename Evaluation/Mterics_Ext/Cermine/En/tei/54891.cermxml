          <p>The knowledge of nursing, in part, corresponds to a set of theories that support professional
practice and reveals the action of care, developed in response to a need of the human being and the
community. This practice of nursing can be seen as a social being exercised by professionals on the
object of your doing, by who establish relationships, applying their knowledge as a way to transform a
concrete reality.1</p>
          <p>From this perspective, theories are built from concepts, models, propositions serve as a
basis to support practical actions, assisting and explaining the approaches taken by the work object
the human being. In nursing, the body of the human being, the person suffering physical,
psychological, social and spiritual, can be understood as the object in which it performs the task of
professional nursing. This task it is the therapeutic care, which is set in action, which develops and
completes with the human being, value-laden ethical and a necessary good people.2</p>
          <p>To understand the formation of theoretical nursing, it briefly redeems some historical events
of the constitution of the profession. The nursing for many years, described its procedures, from
clinical practice to the first decades of the twentieth century, systematize them as first organized
form of knowledge, subsequently, by the institution of the scientific principles that underlie. And
more recently, in the 1950s and 1960s, the concern focused on reflecting more deeply about the
profession, its object of study and the theoretical framework relevant to care, when then began to
be built nursing theories.3</p>
          <p>Theories hold a reciprocal relationship with the nursing actions and jointly exercising daily
work is the therapeutic care, as epistemological object, which refers to the discipline of nursing, to
structuring their professional practice.4</p>
          <p>However, it's still observed in the literature scarcity of scientific theories about the national
nursing. A study on the subject points out that only 4.6% of the publications used nursing theories of
3757 articles, seven nursing journals, from 1998 to 2007.5</p>
          <p>The proposed consideration of theories focuses on nursing recognizing it as a discipline,
profession and social practice, through the formalization of concepts and theories, as the proper
instruments to direct the search for specificity of nursing, ie, limits of performance relative to other
professionals, own body of knowledge, autonomy, professional identity and visibility.6</p>
          <p>In this direction, the Theory of Professional Links (DVT) consists of a tool for nursing, which
aims to train, and continuously affirming interpersonal relationships in nursing team, as a unit group,
in addition to the group of persons with potential for growth and strengthening the practices of care,
through the establishment of healthy professional bonds. This theory, in essence, seeks to address
the interpersonal relationships between nurses and staff, thereby establishing therapeutic
relationships more. Moreover, grasps the links with the development of group dynamics arising from
movements that take place in two spheres of relationships, institutional space and space-specific
care action, directing the action team to the exercise of therapeutic care.7</p>
          <p>Based on these, this paper it is a critical reflection about the importance of nursing theories,
using DVT, as an example, to assert theories as instruments of labor, which formalize the actions of
the nursing profession and, as a social practice, which builds daily.</p>

      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>Epistemological context of nursing</title>
        <p>The construction of knowledge in nursing is still in its initial phase; however, the designation
of care is based on the principle of a practice that develops on the nurse-client interaction, with the
intention of contributing to the welfare this in their daily lives. The watch is designed by many
scholars as an epistemological object of nursing because it involves humans in its complexity, which is
the focus of their work.4</p>
        <p>Progress can also be seen in the evolution of conceptions of the term "human being" and the
paradigm shift in the management and attention paid to the needs of health. In the twentieth century,
there was the assertion of the fragmentation of the human body and mind, from the biomedical model
that produces the mechanism of making the individual's biological vision, expertise about the person's
body, the appreciation of the technical procedures of the act physician and the emphasis on curative
medicine, which reinforce the division of the person into parts, making the union of these fragments,
for an overview of the human being, especially considering besides the organic aspects, such as illness,
other dimensions of human life- psychological, social, spiritual, economic, among others.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the biopsychosocial model of health care and management emerged as a way to
meet the shortcomings of the model history, such as the production of health in people with chronic
diseases, autoimmune cases without clinical diagnoses or difficult to solve . Still, compared to recent
paradigm that other knowledge professionals now become necessary to complexity involving health
care to people.9</p>
        <p>Nowadays, much of the demand for health services, in terms of workforce - professionals, is
related to knowledge that go beyond the biomedical model approach, demanding greater coverage of
the process of health and disease, with emphasis on policies health and operation of new modes of
care. This question is linked to the fact that in recent decades there have been changes in clinical and
epidemiological profile of the population, life expectancy, the economy and world politics, with
consequent restructuring of the health sector and pose new challenges to the professionals, who must
so articulate, organize to confront the problems that arise in different scenarios and actions that
impact the health field and do nursing.10</p>
        <p>In this context, although the nursing care adopt as its object of activity, the profession still
suffers the effects of the need to occupy positions of power and develop nurses as being
sociopolítico.6 Moreover, this area deals with health permanent identity crisis, the lack of an
epistemological and theoretical dependence of scientific practices in the field of health and other
areas.</p>
        <p>Thus, the question is: why not think about the epistemological object as therapeutic care
nursing? Dare to conceive this as metaparadigm this field of knowledge and at the same time, nursing
grounded in epistemic structure multiparadigmatic, before the lack of professional identity and in
accordance with the needs of customer care.</p>
        <p>From this perspective, it is clear that the Brazilian nursing theories are still incomplete, often
being disregarded and devalued in academic and professional spaces.</p>
        <p>These gaps reflect the corpus of nursing, in particular, within the pedagogical and healthcare,
as these are an aspect conditional better understood in relation to theories and practices that once
imported, without being questioned, they became the majority, or hegemonic because measures were
taken as saviors of professional difficulties, accumulated from historical experiences of thinking and
action in nursing. In terms of scientific construction, there is a nursing losses undesirable lack of
power, as knowledge areas face the pressures of health policies by regulators or the funding agencies
and research support.12</p>
        <p>In recent decades, the paradigm shifts in the field of health care and management are
occurring rapidly, since the construction of the social process, which has the most wins the right to
health of millions of Brazilians, from a philosophical and conceptual basis derived in Sanitary Reform
movement, whose landmark the XVIII National Health Conference, held in 1986, which instituted its
eminently interdisciplinary due to multiple measurements and historical mediations. Thus, those who
have concrete object as work health and disease in its social context cannot from a single discipline to
guide their professional actions, because it involves both social relationships and social itself, the
expressions emotional, as well as the biological conditions and reasons socio-cultural and historical
individuals and groups.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in the educational field, the new National Curriculum Guidelines provide an
important achievement in the field of nursing by pointing, as policy, the need to produce changes in
the training process, providing professionals more committed and engaged with the principles and
guidelines of the Unified Health System (SUS). These efforts correspond to the concern of breaking
definitively with the biological paradigm and medicalized, hospital-and procedure-centered, meeting
the new challenges of contemporary knowledge production, the production of professions and
establishing healthy relationships in work teams.</p>
        <p>The link between education, work and social practices envisions a new perspective on
significant transformation in the daily life of each professional involved with comprehensive care,
especially when organized from the health needs of the population. So this is where nursing, as well as
other health professions, needs greater engagement in defense of an argument more solid permeated
by assumptions Health Reform with a view to reviewing, in which lie the paradigm of current models
health care and what has been their role in this process, action that dispenses with the reorientation
of their professional practice.13</p>
        <p>From this point of view, it should be noted that health work is highly relational, since its focus
is human care cannot, as in other production models are cast in equipment or highly structured
knowledge, such as organizational technologies However, the meeting of subjectivities, incorporating a
significant degree of freedom in choosing the method of doing this production.14</p>
        <p>In this space often inconspicuous amid the daily routine of many health workers and the
discussion of the performance of an interdisciplinary manner, which focuses the importance of theories
in the construction of specific core of knowledge, social practice and consolidation limits nursing
activities, by their epistemological possibility in therapeutic care and ethics in dealing with
professional issues.11</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>Theory of professional connections: strengthening practice</title>
        <p>Front exposed to discussion about the epistemological construction of nursing, given the
changes (multi) paradigmatic healthcare, presents itself as an alternative, the Theory of Professional
Links (DVT), seeking to strengthen professional practice in meeting intersubjectivities of subjects,
which act in everyday life on the same team.</p>
        <p>Thus, the scope of the potential of teamwork may be valued at the time at which individuals
recognize themselves as members of a group with a common goal. Thus, team members may feel
responsible, both for its failures as its successes, participating in decision making and particularly
describing the communication of essential information to nursing work.</p>
        <p>Team work can be understood as "a network of relationships between people, power,
knowledge, emotions, desires and interests, it is possible to identify group processes, where teamwork
equals to relate."15:264</p>
        <p>Accordingly, DVT aims to provide nurses a model of teamwork in nursing, which promotes
interpersonal relationships, ie professional ties to the scope object epistemological nursing - care
therapeutic, committed people who need care health services. Furthermore, it allows the
establishment of greater inclusion and significance of the group in the institution, and also reinforces
the very identity of the nurse as leader, ie, team coordinator and the planning of their activities.</p>
        <p>The basic assumptions of this theory are based on a philosophical look at historical and
dialectical materialism, in which the bonds have a professional nature expressed in action and speech.
That is, the bonds between humans are determined by the totality of the person through their
relationship internal and external reflected through their actions and their words, not a part of it,
because the worker must not separate his inner life of its externality, since the extent that the bonds
formed professional group acquires a personality, an identity, determining your viewing and valuing
the institution.</p>
        <p>In addressing the relational skills of the management process in nursing, DVT has several sets
of concepts, especially with regard to the subject of the theory, the nurse and the tool mediates
between the nurses and the other staff members, technicians and assistants nursing and community
health workers, ie, the model for teamwork in nursing. The goal of this proposal is focused on the
relational and managerial actions of the nurse as a mediator in the process of establishment of
Professional Links.</p>
        <p>The theory of knowledge is a process, because it includes the process of working in nursing
and nurse-staff interaction in group dynamics. It is a suggestion with a high level of adaptation to the
reality of the group, but is constructed by the operational method, and presents strategies for
implementation of the theory in a clear and practical, requiring the trader is scientific knowledge,
sensitivity, creativity, imagination and skills to execute them.</p>
        <p>CCOONNCCLLUUSSIIOONN</p>
        <p>This reflection-critique that focused on the importance of nursing theories to strengthen the
profession of nursing and social practice to inter-relate the context of nursing knowledge, DVT stands
as a model to be experienced in daily care in order to qualify the relationship at work. It is, however,
a flexible and adaptable to reality and creativity of nurses.</p>
        <p>Based on the theoretical models it is believed that nursing could provide their professional
identity and body of knowledge, more broadly, including subsidies brought there by DVT relational
issues that mark with a lot of intensity do nursing. This, in turn, while at the same time, requiring
systematic routine operations, mechanized interventions should refuse, since its object of study is the
human being in its uniqueness and subjectivity, thus requiring the humanization of related views
therapeutic care.</p>
        <p>Alert to the need for discussion on the construction of nursing knowledge and reinforces the
suggestion of some researchers, that the epistemological object of nursing, should be careful. As it
becomes imperative investment and enhancement of nursing theories Brazilian, to obtain visibility
epistemological and professional nursing.</p>
