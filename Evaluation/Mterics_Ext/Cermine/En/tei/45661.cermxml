      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Can a person expect to get a car driving license just by attending the theoretical classes? Let us
hypothetically assume the person manages to get a license, but will he be able to drive the car? No.
To be a perfect car driver a person has to and does take real life driving classes. He develops new
skills by actually driving along with the trainer.</p>
      <p>Higher education aims at an optimal blend of knowledge and skills. It provides a license to the
student for driving successfully through the maze of what, when, why, who and how. Usually the
next step after higher education is a professional career. This is why role and importance of active
learning, and not passive learning (in which an instructor depends solely or predominantly on
passive lectures), is crucial throughout higher education.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>2. Active learning</title>
      <p>
        Roots of active learning can be traced to Confucius (551-479 BC), who stated, “I hear and I
forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand”. Socrates (470-399 BC) had similar views
when he said that "I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think".
Dale (1969) established following relationships between level of involvement of learner and how
much the learner remembers:- “We remember: 10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, 30%
of what we see, 50% of what we hear and see, 70% of what we say 90% of what we do”.
Studies show that classroom attention-span of students varies from 15 to 25 minutes (Bligh, 1972
as cited by Cashin, 1985).
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">Meyers &amp; Jones (1993)</xref>
        found that students’ classroom attention is poor
for 40% of the time and they retain 70% of the information during the first ten minutes and only
20% of the information during the last ten minutes of a lecture. In a 1997 national survey in USA,
of more than 250,000 freshmen at nearly 500 universities, 35.6% of the students said that they
were frequently bored in class. (Berk, 2003)
All these facts stress on the need of active learning environment in particular when, feedback
from students has shown that passive lecture in higher education is not a preferred method of
learning. (Sander et al., 2000 as cited by Huxman, 2005)
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>2.1 Active Learning: Defined</title>
      <p>
        Literature review highlighted the following characteristics of active learning.
- Learning is enhanced by involving the student in activities and relationships, inside and
outside the classroom. (Astin, 1984)
- “Lectures are not well suited to higher levels of learning: application, analysis, synthesis,
influencing attitudes or values. Lecturing is best suited to the lower levels of knowledge and
understanding.” (Cashin, 1985)
- “Learning is not a spectator sport. Students do not learn much just by sitting in classes
listening to teachers, memorizing pre-packaged assignments, and spitting out answers. They
must talk about what they are learning, write about it, relate it to past experiences and apply
it to their daily lives.” (Chickering &amp; Gamson, 1987)
- Higher-order thinking through analysis, synthesis and evaluation is more important than
reading, writing and discussing. (Bonwell &amp; Eison, 1991)
- “Active learning involves providing opportunities for students to meaningfully talk and listen,
write, read, and reflect on the content, ideas, issues and concerns of an academic subject.”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Meyers &amp; Jones, 1993)</xref>
        - “Although humans appreciate the common and the familiar, and often resist change, the
brain seeks and reacts to innovative occurrences.”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Angelo, 1991 as cited by Forrest, 2004)</xref>
        - “In fact, rote learning (e.g., memorizing terminology) is frustrating because the brain resists
meaningless stimuli.” (Forrest, 2004)
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>Thus we may derive following definition:Active learning involves designing, implementing, maintaining and promoting, within and outside classroom, environment for learning, through creating opportunities for active engagement with the subject matter. It strives for higher-order thinking and in-depth comprehension of the learner.</title>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>2.2 Active Learning: Drawbacks</title>
      <p>
        Active involvement and interaction of the students translate into loss of teaching time as
substantial classroom time is spent on multiple questioning and feedback sessions,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5 ref8">(Lammers &amp;
Murphy, 2002 as cited by Huxman, 2005)</xref>
        especially while handling large classes.(Bonwell, C. &amp;
J. Eison, 1991) It results into lesser content coverage in the classroom.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref5">(Murray &amp; Brightman,
1996 as cited by Huxman, 2005)</xref>
        . But the biggest roadblock is a creation of the instructor himself
and that is fear of failure, fear of loss of control due to enhanced classroom discussions, fear of
lack of student participation, and fear of criticism of a new method. (Bonwell, C. &amp; J. Eison, 1991)
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>2.2.1 Handling drawbacks: Short Lectures</title>
      <p>An analysis of research papers on higher education by Chilcoat (1989) found that, continuous
rapid lecturing happens at a rate of 120 to 240 words per minute but most of the students can
write down only 20 words per minute. Result is half cooked notes and poor understanding during
lecture time.</p>
      <p>
        A solution to the above problem can be found in a study conducted by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Ruhl et al. (1987)</xref>
        , in which
the instructor paused for two minutes for three times during a lecture, and during these pauses
students worked in pairs to re-discuss the topic discussed by the instructor and then reworked on
their class notes to fill up the gaps left while taking down the notes during lecture. During the
pauses students did not engage in discussion with the instructor. At the end of the lecture three
minutes were given to let the students write down their free recall. Results proved that short
lectures of 12 to 18 minutes followed by pauses for student interaction enhance students’ learning.
Bonwell and Eison (1991), suggest to conduct guided lecture in which instructor lectures
continuously for 20 to 30 minutes without the students taking notes and then allots five minutes
for free recall writing by the students followed by small groups of students discussing and
analyzing the topic.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>2.2.2 Handling drawbacks: Revised lecture information density</title>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Russell et al. (1984)</xref>
        conducted a research on 123 medical students and divided them into three
groups with no significant difference in cumulative GPA’s. First group was exposed to high
density lecture with 90% new content, second group was exposed to medium density lecture with
70% new content and third to low density lecture with 50% new content. In each lecture the
remaining time was spent on reinforcing the core ideas by actively involving the students and by
relating the content to prior experience. Tests after the lectures confirmed that learning and
retention was higher with low density content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fedler &amp; Brent (1996) suggest to discuss only core, critical and difficult topics in class, to give
brief writing assignments to the students on the self covered topics and then to test the students on
those topics.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Wilke (2003)</xref>
        conducted a research on 141 students in human physiology and
found that active learning improved students’ content achievement even when the content is
reduced. Research had proved time and again that reduced lecture time and reduced lecture
information density enhances learning.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>2.2.3 Handling drawbacks: Expectations and responsibilities</title>
      <p>
        Lesser lecture time in the classroom and lower density content should not lead to lower
expectations of the students or instructor. Chickering &amp; Gamson (1987) suggest “expect more and
you will get more”.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Seeler et al. (1994)</xref>
        suggests that active learning environment does not mean
structure less learning environment and it does not mean undermining the importance of theory.
Active learning environment not only increases the opportunities for interaction and involvement
but also responsibilities. Following are some important expectations and responsibilities as
suggested by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Seeler et al. (1994)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Students must be more aware and be ready to be responsible for their own professional
development. They must increase their level of involvement in the active learning environment
and focus on application of theory to real life practice. But this does not mean that the instructor is
less responsible for active learning environment.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Seeler et al. (1994)</xref>
        further suggest active
learning depends on the success of the instructor in helping the students successfully manage
transition from passive style of learning to the new one. Instructor needs to understand ability of
the student, develop new skills, be aware of practical applications of theory to design exercises
and assignments accordingly, adopt the role of facilitator and mentor. Instructor must rely on
feedback and make changes, if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Stinson &amp; Milter (1996)</xref>
        also highlight instructor’s skill development and student transition as two
major pillars of active learning environment. They point out that the instructor needs to be an
active listener and a coach. So that he can encourage the students to take responsibility of their
own learning. This can be done effectively when the instructor gives continuous and prompt
feedback to the students. (Chickering &amp; Gamson 1987)
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>2.2.4 Handling drawbacks: Student and instructor rapport</title>
      <p>
        Confucius believed in affection and empathy towards students (Huanyin, Y., 1999). Chickering &amp;
Gamson (1987) adviced instructors to “encourage contact between student and faculty”. Tiberius
&amp; Billson
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref2">(Tiberius &amp; Billson, 1991 as cited by Fleming, 2003)</xref>
        emphasized on need of a trust
based, open and cooperative relationship between an instructor and his students which is guided,
not by control, but by mutual agreement.
      </p>
      <p>Active learning demands involvement. Involvement demands interaction. Fruitful interaction
demands rapport. But that does not mean that an instructor has to indulge in students’
appeasement. He has to rather strive for a growth oriented relationship with sincerity and honesty.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>2.3 Co-operative active learning</title>
      <p>Active learning may be implemented through different routes. One of the popular routes is
cooperative active learning. Students’ involvement amongst themselves is crucial for successful
active learning environment. As Chickering &amp; Gamson (1987) stated, “learning isn’t solo race
rather it’s a team effort which depends on collaboration and cooperation amongst students.” In
cooperative learning a class is divided into smaller groups to enhance understanding and learning
of students through positive interdependence, individual accountability, continuous interaction,
teamwork, to accomplish orderly thinking, problem solving, critical analysis and clear expression
(Johnson et al. 1998).</p>
      <p>
        Imagine six stand alone desktop computers and now compare it with a group of six networked
computers. Which would give higher volume of fast information sharing and processing? Off
course the networked group. Cooperative learning aims at developing a network of human brains
to achieve higher levels of learning, and to prevent this network from crashing the size of the
teams is kept smaller. Student attendance is essential in a cooperative learning environment as
absence of one or few team member(s) might disturb the task accomplishment and create a
negative impact on the team spirit.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(McManus, 1996)</xref>
        .
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Finlay and Faulkner (2005)</xref>
        conducted a
project in which self help reading groups of 3-5 students were formed. Each student had to read a
different topic each week and then had to write one page synopsis which was later discussed with
the group. After the reading students asked questions among themselves. 73% of the students
expressed positive perception of the method. Boud et al. (1999) refer to a term “peer learning” in
which students learn in a group without intervention of an instructor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cooperative learning aims at self help in pursuit of knowledge. It may partially involve the
instructor or it may be practiced without instructor’s intervention. One logical adaptation would
be to initiate cooperative learning with higher degree of instructor’s involvement and intervention
and to gradually reduce the involvement after judging the degree of self sufficiency of the group.
Cooperative learning may promote social loafing.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Latane et al. (1979)</xref>
        in their research found that
individuals tend to reduce effort when performing in a group. This is called social loafing. Maniar
(2002) researched team work in business and sports and found that individual input reduces with
the increase in size of a team. To prevent social loafing he suggests to evaluate each individual on
his/her contribution, give smaller awards along the way instead of rewarding the group at the end
of the task.
      </p>

      <title>2.4 Assignment based active learning</title>
      <p>
        Since 1988, University of Hawai at Manoa has been running “writing intensive” classes which
aims at “learning through writing”.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(UHM 2006)</xref>
        An internal study has found that students have
positive perception of the program and writing intensive assignments enhance learning amongst
the students, but they need to be taught how to write to learn. The strategy used by the university
is to guide students to improve their analytical skills through synthesis of the journal articles,
improve their reading skills through writing summaries, learn data collection techniques , to
improve their analytical skills by examining research articles and then to present their own views
through writing intensive assignments. Plagiarism may be cited as a big drawback of writing
intensive assignments but a software like ‘Turnitin’ (www.turnitin.com) helps to keep a check on
students indulging in plagiarism.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-11">
      <title>2.5 Problem based active learning</title>
      <p>Problem based learning is a self directed effort of a student towards understanding the solution of
a problem. In this process the student identifies what he knows and what he needs to know to
solve the problem. (Barrows and Tamblyn 1980) Instead of feeding the students with readymade
content through lectures and discussions, problem based learning begins with a challenge of
presenting a real life problem through case studies, research papers, assignment etc to the students,
the answer to which they have to find on their own, individually and/or collectively. This method
drastically changes the role of the students as well as the instructor.</p>
      <p>The usual practice of teaching is to explain the concept to the students and then follow with
questions. Problem based learning (PBL) is exactly opposite as in PBL the beginning is with a
problem and in due course of time students acquire knowledge and skills to solve the problem. A
teacher is no more a provider of quick and easy answers rather he becomes a facilitator in search
of relevant information. The biggest challenge for successful implementation of PBL is the
willingness and ability of the instructor to create a learning environment which is not teacher
centered and in which the student actively guides his own learning, individually or in a group.
(Barrows &amp; Tamblyn, 1980).</p>
      <p>
        Second most important challenge while implementing PBL is the selection of a problem.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Stinson
&amp; Milter, (1996)</xref>
        suggest the selected problem should reflect real life circumstances and be
contemporary to facilitate the process of learning and doing. They further suggest the problem to
be ill-structured, as real life problems are rarely structured. An ill-structured problem would
enable the student to comprehend ill defined situations. Duch (1996) insists that an effective
problem must engage and motivate students, should be connected to previously learned
knowledge, be open ended and not limited to one correct answer, must encourage higher level of
learning by asking for solutions based on facts and logic. Duch (1996) further clarifies that instead
of dividing the problem into smaller units to be individually solved by a student, an effective
problem should encourage total involvement of a students group and prevent “divide and
conquer” of the assignment. We may conclude that PBL attempts to bridge the gap between
education and research.
      </p>

    <sec id="sec-12">
      <title>3. Multiple intelligence and multi-sense oriented learning.</title>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">Gardner’s (1993</xref>
        ) concept of multiple intelligence identified that each individual has following
eight facets of intelligence. Logical-mathematical intelligence makes a learner quick with
numbers, strong in reasoning and scientific thinking. Verbal-linguistic makes a learner
comfortable with languages and communication including verbal and written assignments etc.
Musical-rhythmic intelligence relates to recognition and use of sounds and audio presentations.
Naturalist intelligence relates to ability to work with nature, field trips, real life situations.
Visualspatial relates to sense of sight and ability to make mental images and concept maps.
Interrelational relates to inter personal skills such as communication and team work. Intra relational is
associated with understanding of self. Bodily-kinesthetic is associated with body movements.
Visual based instructions using audio visual models, films, 3D graphs enhance the productivity of
active learning environment (Cashin,1985; Bonwell &amp; Eison 1991). VARK (Visual, Aural,
Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning strategy attempts to create an active learning environment. In
visual learning an instructor uses gestures and picturesque language, pictures, videos, posters,
slides, colour flow-charts, colour graphs and diagrams, underlining and different colour
highlighters etc.
      </p>
      <p>In aural learning classroom discussions between learner and instructor and amongst learner play
an important role. Outside classroom strategy involves spending time in a quiet place and
recalling the ideas and speaking out the answers aloud or inside head to register the content in
mind.</p>
      <p>Read/write learning strategy works well when the content involves lots of definitions, glossaries,
manuals, dictionaries. This strategy requires the students to undertake multiple writing and
reading sessions. To reinforce learning frequent multiple choice tests are suggested.
In kinesthetic learning strategy field tours and trips, lectures with real life examples, laboratory
sessions, learning from trial and error etc is given emphasis. Use of case studies and applications
to help with principles and abstract concepts is suggested. (Complete information on VARK
adapted from www.vark-learn.com).</p>
      <p>A comprehensive active learning environment which can successfully engage the learners with
consistency will need to address the issues of multiple intelligence and multiple human senses. A
multi dimensional communication will strengthen the learning environment. Multiple intelligence
identifies different facets of human intelligence, and a successful active learning environment
needs to implement variety of tools to address these facets.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-13">
      <title>4. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Active learning is more than a technique or a tool. Active learning is a way of life. There are three
major components of an active learning environment and they are students, instructors and
institute/management. Active learning environment demands behavior modification on the part of
students, instructors and institute/management. The speed and intensity of implementing a step
by step comprehensive active learning environment in higher education has to be determined by
the desire, ability and willingness of the students, instructors and institute/management.
Instead of developing and implementing a learning environment which is decided by the
management/faculty/consultant, the need identification for an activity based environment in the
mindset of the students has to be given importance. There is a need of a paradigm shift from the
usual approach of ‘how I like to teach’ to ‘how the learner wants to learn and how the learner will
learn better’.</p>
      <p>Apart from the methods already discussed there are multiple tools to choose from for
implementing active learning environment, such as,
- Group brainstorming
- Think-pair-share (A tool in which students are divided into groups of two and they
discuss their understanding of the topic after a short lecture)
- One minute papers on the muddiest point, difficult topic, easiest definition etc.
- Concept maps (A tool which abets in comprehending the logical relationships amongst a
number of ideas within a topic of discussion by creating a visual map of the connections.)
- Students role play, simulations.
- Short writing assignments/ summaries.</p>
      <p>- Classroom debates and discussions.</p>
      <p>One can pick and choose any combination of the methods and tools discussed in this research
paper but the selection of a combination has to be guided by the habits, preferences, willingness,
behaviour modification, knowledge base and learning style of the students and also the instructors.
Following may be considered as prerequisites for a successful active learning environment:
1. Clarity, creativity and likeability of the tools and techniques used
2. Degree (positive) of behaviour modification (engagement and involvement) of the
students induced by the tools used.
3. Synergy of active learning environment with the present and required knowledge base of
the instructor and learners.</p>
      <sec id="sec-13-1">
        <title>4. Synergy of active learning with course, syllabus and time schedule.</title>
        <p>5. Availability of relevant case studies, problems, assignments, tests, related infrastructure.
6. Complete involvement of all the stakeholders: faculty, support staff, institute’s
management, students (individually &amp; jointly), and parents.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-13-2">
        <title>7. Examination performance enhancement by the tools and techniques used.</title>
        <p>8. Within and outside classroom as well as within and outside college, learning continuity.
To conclude, active learning would start with an instructor who is an active learner and active
instructor himself and who can upgrade his knowledge and skills in the time of need. He has to
then identify the needs of the students with reference to changes expected in learning environment.
He then has to balance the students needs with what he thinks is best for the learning environment.
This would lead to the preliminary preparations in collaboration with the learners and would be
followed by gradual, step by step implementation of the new methods and tools.
Continuous feedback from the students and supervision by the instructor might be essential at an
early stage. Regular evaluation of the learning environment is essential through class tests,
vivavoce, evaluation of assignments (by instructor or by students themselves), students’ feedback
(informal classroom feedback and/or formal questionnaire based feedback), peer feedback (by
instructor’s colleagues).</p>
