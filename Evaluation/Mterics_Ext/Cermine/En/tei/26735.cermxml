      <p>In this paper I address, in a preliminary way, a problem of political theory
that, while not new, has been brought home with special urgency by recent
events. The problem is the predicament created by the imperative of coming
to terms with the subject of political possibility and the concomitant
difficulty of doing so. The argument of this paper is circuitous. I first argue
that grappling with the subject of political possibility requires that we
examine the intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. I draw a
crucial distinction between the ways that the ability to calculate
probabilities and to entertain possibilities enters into social and political
interaction. I than identify the mechanisms – attention and imagination – at
work in the ways symbolic forms govern our ability to envision possibilities. I
show how political possibility is implicated with power. And I sketch some
of the constraints and vicissitudes that make the politics of possibility a
precarious enterprise. I conclude by briefly connecting my preceding
analysis to the theme of antipolitics.
A first version of this paper was presented at the
July 1994 conference Vienna Dialogue on
Democracy on “The Politics of Antipolitics” which
was organized by the Institute for Advanced
Studies’ Department of Political Science. I am
grateful to Emily Hauptman, Norbert Lechner and
Ruth A. Bevan for their comments on that
occasion.</p>
      <p>
        In this paper I address a problem of political theory that, while not new, has
been brought home with special urgency by recent events. The problem is
the predicament created by the imperative of coming to terms with the
subject of political possibility and the concomitant difficulty of doing so
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Dunn 1980, 267,260)</xref>
        . In the face of this quandary I pursue a basic intuition:
in order to properly conceptualize political possibility we must recognize
and analyze the intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. In other
words, in order to better understand the notion of political possibility we
must properly grasp its cultural dimensions. An example will perhaps lend
some, at least initial, plausibility to this intuition.
      </p>
      <p>The example is drawn from an interview, conducted in October 1982,
with Bogdan Borusewisz, a Solidarity activist and underground leader. Early
in the interview he harshly criticized the stance adopted by some Solidarity
leaders during the period leading up to December 1981 when the Polish
regime imposed marshal law.</p>
      <p>“There came a point when democratically elected activists lost all
contact with reality. And reality was more than Solidarity, more than
radical leaflets, and Radio Free Europe; it was the USSR, the army,
and the security service, which we already knew in the autumn of 1980
had drawn up a list of people to be interned (Lopinski, Moskit and
Wilk, 1990, 8).”
In other words, Borusewisz was no wild utopian, intent on holding out
fantastic alternatives. He was aware that political reality and possibility are,
in crucial ways, distinguished by material considerations.</p>
      <p>In the same interview, however, Borusewisz reflects on the reasons
why, during the days immediately after the regime imposed martial law, he
and others thought it imperative to sustain the strike at the Lenin shipyard.
“After all we had to defend a symbol; it wasn’t a question of the
Gdansk shipyard or the Repair Yard or even Gdansk itself but of
Poland as a whole. If we’d managed to draw out the strike in the
shipyard it might have been possible to hold back the authorities on all
fronts. On the other hand, I was certain that if the strike at the
shipyard collapsed, the fact that a coal mine or steel works was on
strike wouldn’t have made any difference, because people think in
terms of symbols and would hang on as long as the shipyard hung on.
That is why I tried desperately to defend the shipyard (Lopinski, Moskit
and Wilk 1990, 30–31).”
As this passage makes clear, Borusewisz and others recognized that, over
a decade or so, Poles invested the Gdansk shipyard with special
significance. They had transformed the shipyard into a symbol, one that
enabled opponents of the regime to sustain an alternative vision of ‘Poland
as a whole.’1 Consequently, it became a focal point in the strategic struggle
between the opposition and the regime. Unlike strikes elsewhere, the one at
the shipyard, according to Borusewisz, symbolized the possibility, however
fleeting, that Poles might resist marshal law. Ultimately, Solidarity could not

among the central symbols in the “tradition of resistance” that Polish workers first
constructed and then extended to other portions of society (Laba 1991).
sustain the strike at the shipyard. And although other strikes continued, the
collapse of the strike there rendered the possibility of widespread, overt
resistance inconceivable.</p>
      <p>This example is intended to suggest how intimately connected symbol and
strategy are in social and political life, and how they are related in ways that
directly effect our capacity to envision political possibilities. My aim in this
paper is to explore, and hopefully clarify, these claims in a preliminary way.</p>
      <p>
        The remainder of the paper consists of six sections. In sections two
and three I draw and hopefully make clear a crucial distinction between the
ways that the ability to calculate probabilities and to entertain possibilities
enter into social and political interaction. And I argue that the latter capacity
is governed by the force of prevailing symbolic forms. In section four I
identify the mechanisms at work in the ways symbolic forms govern our
ability to envision possibilities. In section five I address the ways that
political possibility is implicated with power. In section six I sketch some of
the constraints and vicissitudes that render the politics of possibility a
difficult and precarious undertaking. In section seven I briefly connect my
argument to the theme of antipolitics.
“What is politically possible depends in part on what men believe”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Dunn
1980, 260)</xref>
        .2 This is no doubt so. But it also is too quick. I put to one side
for the moment matters of material or physical constraint. In this section I
argue that the scope of political possibility is, in the most basic,
theoretically important sense constituted not by beliefs or expectations per
se, but by the range of things (e.g., actors, events, outcomes) concerning
which relevant agents can hold beliefs or establish expectations. Here
again, perhaps an example will help.
      </p>
      <p>In his Antipolitics, a book largely devoted to envisioning a possible
post-Yalta political framework, George Konrad reflected on, among other
things, the prevailing uncoordinated, largely individualistic strategy of
opposition in Hungary. He explained that:
“We Hungarians never created our own KOR or Solidarity, because we
didn’t really believe that communist power could be reconciled with
democratic institutions born of society’s aspirations of
selfdetermination. We saw what our Polish friends were doing; we wanted
them to succeed, but doubted that they could (Konrad 1984, 129–30).”
This is a straightforward estimation of probabilities. Oppositional elements
in Hungary, according to Konrad, had no difficulty envisioning collective
political strategies such as those adopted by KOR or Solidarity. They
simply believed that such strategies held out a very low probability of
success.</p>
      <p>Consider, by contrast, the emergence of radically unanticipated actors
onto the political stage. When I say that such actors are radically
unanticipated I mean that ex ante their appearance as political actors was
not just unforeseen but unforeseeable. Here we might include, for instance,
the way that the British working classes intruded into politics under the
aegis of Chartism in the late 1830’s. Or, more recently, and perhaps of
2 Dunn himself is concerned with grounding the notion of political obligation in a general
conception of what in different times and places is political possible. He does not
systematically explore the notion of political possibility.
greater relevance to the topic of antipolitics, we might we might include the
way mothers infiltrated Argentine politics in the late 1970’s. In such
instances the very incongruity of such actors engaging in politics – as
workers, or as mothers – scrambles established political categories and,
thereby redefines the realm of possibility.3 In the latter case, for a period of
time this incongruity prevented the Argentine Junta from recognizing the
Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo as political actors in any relevant sense.
Within the political categories to which the junta, like the rest of Argentine
society, subscribed, “mothers were not perceived as political subjects.” The
Mothers of the Plaza, as a result, were enshrouded by a “political
invisibility” that afforded them a strategically crucial, if temporary, advantage
over the junta.4 This was a matter not of probability but of possibility or, for
lack of a better word, worldview. During the early months of the Mother’s
weekly demonstrations in the Plaza de Mayo, the junta literally did not
understand the political nature of the protests. Such activity transgressed
the boundaries of their political world. It simply was not possible for mothers
to engage in politics.5 By the time the junta reconfigured their conception of
political possibility so that they could recognize the Mothers as political
actors, and take repressive measures, it was too late. The Mothers of the
Plaza already had come to symbolize, both domestically and in the
international arena, the possibility of open resistance to the Argentine
regime.</p>
      <p>A worldview amounts to a basic understanding of how the world
operates, of the sorts of entities (actors, events, outcomes) it contains.
Among the components of a worldview is a more or less systematic “folk
psychology,” a general conception of persons and a corresponding set of
expectations about how they typically behave.6 In the present paper I focus
exclusively on this dimension of political possibility – the types of political
subject that relevant actors can hold beliefs or develop expectations about.</p>
      <p>
        It is important to distinguish, then, between the different ways that the
calculation of probabilities and the consideration of possibilities inform
political action.7 And it is important to see how the latter trades upon the
3 Dorothy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">Thompson (1984</xref>
        , 11–12) captures the in congruity of workers entering the
political of early nineteenth century Britain in the following way. “In the 1830’s the good
self-respecting workman did not mix in politics. ... When HM Inspector of Prisons interviewed
the men in prison for Chartist activ ities in 1840, he spoke approvingly of the decision some
had made to ‘give up politics.’ It did not occur to him that former Chartists should become
Whigs or Tories. Politics in any form was not the business of the working man.”
4 I draw the quoted phrases from Navarro (1989, 257).
5 Hence the practice of the junta of referring to the Mothers as the “madwomen” of the
Plaza.
6 On this point see generally
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">Geertz (1983</xref>

7 “There is a fundamental difference between a situation in which a decision maker is
uncertain about the state of X and a situation in which the decision maker has not given any
thought to whether X matters or not, between a situation in which a prethought event judged
of low probability occurs and a situation in which something occurs that has never been
thought about, between judging an action unlikely to succeed and never thinking about an
action. The latter situations in each pair are not adequately modeled in terms of low
probabilities”

        .
intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. All of this will perhaps
emerge more clearly if we examine attempts to depict the world solely in
terms of the calculation of probabilities.
      </p>
      <p>Consider, in this respect, the austere, counterfactual world that
rational choice theorists construct. Samuel Popkin’s The Rational Peasant
supplies a particularly instructive example. Early on, Popkin proclaims that
he will advance an exclusively rational choice analysis of Vietnamese
peasant politics and that, in so doing, he will treat cultural considerations
as “givens” (Popkin 1979, 82). He aims to explain peasant politics solely in
terms of the peasants’ self-interest and their estimates of the likelihood that
those interests can be realized. Toward the end of the book, however,
Popkin reflects briefly on the decisive role that he attributes to “political
entrepreneurs” in facilitating collective action among peasants (Popkin
1979, 259–66). He suggests that the success or failure of these leaders
depended crucially on their competence and credibility. But, somewhat
surprisingly, Popkin insists that their credibility derived from “cultural
bases.” He attributes the variable success of religious and political
entrepreneurs over time to their differential ability “to utilize cultural themes”,
to orchestrate “terms and symbols,” that resonated with their potential
constituents (Popkin, 1979, 260–61). In short, political entrepreneurs
engender and sustain credibility through symbolic action. They seek to
coordinate and mobilize relevant constituencies by more or less skillfully
deploying symbolic forms that have force over them.</p>
      <p>I will return to Popkin shortly. But now consider a second theoretical
example, one much closer to the “core” of the rational choice research
tradition. Here I have in mind the ways that, like Popkin, non-cooperative
game theorists tacitly incorporate symbolic considerations into their
purportedly purely strategic models. For present purposes I will consider
only one of the ways they do so.8</p>
      <p>Game theorists tacitly incorporate symbolic force into their standard
procedure for transforming games of incomplete information into equivalent
but technically more tractable games of complete but imperfect information.
This procedure is complex.9 Simply put, it reduces, for analytical purposes,
all forms of uncertainty to mutual uncertainty about the payoff functions
characteristic of players in the game. All players in the game then construct
conditional probabilities over the “types” of other player that they might
encounter based on an initial objective distribution that game theorists
typically attribute to “nature.”</p>
      <p>
        Symbol and strategy intersect here because, as game theorists
typically do not recognize, “types” are not natural categories.
“The everyday world in which members of any community move, their
taken for granted field of social action, is populated not by anybodies,
faceless men without qualities, but by somebodies, concrete classes
of determinant persons positively characterized and appropriately
labeled. And the symbol systems which define these classes are not
given in the nature of things – they are historically constructed,
socially maintained and individually applied
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Geertz 1973, 363–64)</xref>
        .”
8 A more obvious example is the way that
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Schelling (1960)</xref>
        invokes the “symbolic contents
of the game” in order to explain how problems of multiple equilibria are resolved in strategic
settings. This remains the standard resolution t o this endemic problem even among more
highly technical game theorists (Kreps 1990, 101; Myerson 1992).
9 For a survey see Myerson (1985, 231–42).
The range of possible “types” in any population is marked and interpreted
symbolically. Thus, for example, recalling the revolutionary events of Paris
in 1848, Tocqueville reports repeated encounters with “workers,” whom he
readily identifies by their “blouses, which, as we all know, are their fighting
as well as their working clothes”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(Tocqueville 1987, 142 stress added)</xref>
        .10
Here clothing operates as a symbolic marker, allowing Tocqueville to
recognize the types of actors he encounters and, thereby, to navigate
perilous, highly indeterminant political circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>Return now to Popkin. On his account, the political entrepreneurs who
sought to coordinate the collective action among the Vietnamese peasantry
encountered the daunting prior problem of projecting comprehensible,
credible “visions of the future” (Popkin 1988, 61–62; 1979, 261). This
required that they recast a political world populated by “rational peasants”
into one in which other “types” – specifically credible, committed
entrepreneurs – were genuinely possible. And it required articulating this
possibility in “terms and symbols” that had force for relevant constituencies.
Popkin argues that Communist organizers did not enjoy success
comparable to that of religious leaders until they learned to articulate their
vision of the future in indigenous cultural idioms. Prior to that point
“[p]easants did not understand why organizers were offering to help them
and were reluctant to join with them for even small local projects” (Popkin
1988, 62 stress added; 1979, 261). Their world was symbolically
constituted in such a way that it could not accommodate the entrepreneurs’
“type” as a genuine possibility. It thereby foreclosed the very possibility of
cooperative collective action.</p>
      <p>Consider the following remark that Jürgen Habermas once made in the
course of a discussion of utopia.</p>
      <p>
        “In specific historical moments, where we can recognize a real social
movement, real historical struggles, we also become aware that
people do not fight for abstractions – despite the three great and
ineradicable goals of the French Revolution. People do not fight for
abstractions, but with images. Banners, symbols, rhetorical speech,
allegorical speech, utopia-inspired speech, in which concrete goals are
conjured up before people’s eyes, are indeed necessary constituents
of movements which have any effect on history at all (Habermas, 1986,
145–6).”
10 For further references to the “blouses” of workers, see Tocqueville (1987, 117,130,145).
Tocqueville also intimates that workers were adept at interpreting the attire of other classes.
For instance, during the June days he and Corcelle, a fellow delegate to the National Assembly,
undertook something of a reconnaissance mission through the streets of Paris. He relates one
of Corcelle’s adventures in the following terms. “He told me afterwards that, having first
passed several half-constructed barricades without obstruction, he was halted at the last one;
the workers building it, seeing a fine gentleman in a black suit with clean white linen quietly
walking around the dirty streets by the Hotel de Ville and stopping in front of them with a
placid air of curiosity, decided to make some use of this suspicious onlooker. They asked him
in the name of fraternity to help them in their work. Corcelle ... in the circumstances ...
rightly thought it best to yield without a fuss. So there he was levering up the pavement and
putting the stones on top of one another as tidily as he could. His natural clumsiness and his
wandering thoughts luckily came to his aid, and he was soon dismissed as a useless laborer”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(Tocqueville 1987, 139 stress added)</xref>
        .
I agree. In fact, I would suggest that this remark is relevant not just to
remarkable episodes, but, to political action and interaction more generally.
      </p>
      <p>Habermas, nonetheless leaves open at least two especially pressing
sets of theoretical questions. First, if as Bogdan Borusewisz noted in my
initial example, ‘people think in terms of symbols,’ how are we to
understand this process. In other words, why do political actors, whether
individual or collective, indeed fight “with” symbols? What sort of force do
symbols have that make them effective resources in political struggle? And,
second, how are we to understand the dynamics of such symbolic
contests? How do we specify the character of symbolic action? I address
the first set of question in this section and the second set in the next
section.</p>
      <p>
        Cultures consist of intersubjectively shared symbols which actors
invest with meaning and deploy in ritual, tradition and other cultural
performances. It is a sort of “symbolic strategy for encompassing
situations,” for imposing conceptual order on otherwise indeterminant
processes of interaction
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Geertz 1973, 250,230,89; Ortner 1984, 129)</xref>
        .11
On this view: “Symbols instigate social action”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Turner 1974, 55)</xref>
        . However,
they do so, as I now argue, only indirectly. To see why, it is necessary to
understand how symbols work. This, in turn, requires that we distinguish for
analytical purposes the “scope” of symbolic forms from their “force.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The scope of a symbol or cultural performance refers to “the range of
social contexts within which” relevant actors regard it “as having more or
less direct relevance.” Its force refers to its “centrality or marginality” in the
lives of relevant actors, to the “psychological grip” it exercises over them
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Geertz, 1968, 111–113)</xref>
        . The efficacy of a set of symbolic forms clearly
depends on the scope that actors attribute to it. This accounts for the
propensity of oppositional social and political movements, for example, to
generate elaborate, encompassing “alternative cultures.”12 Yet force takes
analytical priority over scope. Any claim regarding the scope of a particular
symbol or practice presupposes that it has force. Absent such force it
wouldn’t be relevant to any social context.
      </p>
      <p>
        The force of symbolic forms is at bottom cognitive or conceptual
(Lukes 1977, 68f). Symbolic forms, orchestrated in cultural performances of
various sorts, “structure the way people think about social life” (Moore and
Myerhoff 1977, 4).13 They serve as “extrinsic sources of information”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Geertz 1973, 92)</xref>
        not in the sense that they convey detailed messages, but
in a broader sense of imparting a view of how the world actually is – how it
operates and how individuals can be expected to act within it. Symbolic
11 On this view, culture consists of “a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic
forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate and develop their knowledge about
and attitudes toward life.” And a symbol is “any object, act, event, quality, or relation which
serves as a vehicle for a conception – the conception being the symbol’s ‘meaning’ ”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Geertz
1973, 89,91,10)</xref>
        . On the career of this concept of culture see Ortner (1984) and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">Barth (1989)</xref>
        .
12 This was true, for example, of British Chartists in the 1830’s and 1840’s, of American
populism in the 1890’s, of the turn of the century German labor movement, and of Italian
Communists in the 1970’s.
13 This obviously presumes something about the way we think. But it does not entail
psychological reductionism. Rather, it presumes an “extrinsic theory” of mind in which diverse
human mental functions – cognition, emotions, dispositions, etc. – all essentially depend upon
the availability of sets of symbolic forms
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Geertz 1973, 215,45–6,76f,360f)</xref>
        . Thus, as
psychologist Jerome Bruner (1986, 15) contends, “a cultural tool kit – a set of prosthetic
devices, so to speak” is essential to the full flourishing of “human mental activity.” See also
Wittgenstin (1967, para. 605–7).
forms, then, do not directly instill beliefs or values. Rather, they establish
the focal categories of social and political interaction and, thereby, establish
parameters on belief formation. Symbolic forms help delineate – in at least
two empirically intertwined but analytically distinguishable ways – the realm
of social and political possibility for relevant actors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first place, symbolic forms operate indicatively to focus the
attention of actors, directing it toward certain ranges of alternatives and
away from others.14 They assert order, relation and predictability in the face
of indeterminacy (Moore and Myerhoff, 1977, 18). They foreclose
possibilities. This process is not naive. Symbolic force discriminates. By
calling attention to certain options, thereby defining them as viable or
feasible, it forecloses other options. It constitutes social and political
interactions on particular, partial terms
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Lukes 1977, 68–9; Elkins and
Simeon 1979, 128; Kertzer 1988, 87)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        If symbolic forms only operated indicatively they would have an
unvaryingly constraining, conservative impact on social and political
interaction. But symbols also operate subjunctively to disclose possibilities
often not immediately discernable in mundane existence. They thus open
options that might go otherwise unconsidered
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29 ref3">(Bruner 1986, 26,159; Turner
1987, 26–7,41–42,101)</xref>
        . Orchestrated in cultural performances such as
ritual, for example, symbolic forms give palpable existence to as yet
unrealized possibility.15 They nourish the imagination of social and political
actors, helping to “render the world less fixed, less banal, more susceptible
to recreation”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Bruner, 1986, 159)</xref>
        . Thus, this process is not naive either. By
imaginatively disclosing and exploring possibilities actors can, within limits,
redefine their options.
      </p>
      <p>Symbolic forms, then, exert force over social and political actors by
commanding their attention and capturing their imagination. They govern the
mental capacities with which actors delimit the possibilities embodied in
their extant situation and envision those that lie beyond it. So understood,
the force of symbolic forms grounds the intimate relation between symbol
and strategy in politics.</p>
      <p>
        Symbolic forms govern prevailing conceptions of possibility. They are, in
Charles
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">Taylor (1985)</xref>
        terms, “constitutive” of practices and institutions.
This, however, leaves us on an ambiguous theoretical terrain. On the one
hand, possibility is not defined purely by structural causes.16 The notion of
political possibility, in particular, presumes that actors intentionally and
deliberately endeavor to constitute the world in particular ways
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Elster 1978,
48–49)</xref>
        . On the other hand, constituting or reconstituting the social and
political world, disclosing or foreclosing possibilities, does not involve
selecting or rejecting discrete, pre-defined alternatives. It is not, strictly
14 Stinchcombe suggests that attention is “the key link between individuals and cultural
systems.” The force of symbolic forms on his view resides in part in their capacity to establish
“attention structures” that provide common foci of choice and interaction
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Stinchcombe
1968, 247,235–36)</xref>
        . Thus, as Elkins and Simeon (1979, 142,127–28,131,139) put the point:
“Culture is unlikely to be of much help in explaining why alternative A was chosen over
alternative B – but it may be of great help in understanding why A and B were considered,
while no thought was given to C, D, or E.”
15 “In ritual,” for example, “the world as lived and the world as imagined, fused under the
agency of a single set of symbolic forms, turn out to be the same world”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Geertz, 1973, 112)</xref>
        .

speaking, a matter of choice
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Follesdal 1981, 402)</xref>
        . Rather, it is a matter of
the ways political actors seek, for strategic purposes, to exploit the force
that symbolic forms hold for relevant constituencies. How are we to
understand the character of such symbolic action?
      </p>
      <p>In the first place, symbolic action consists largely in the efforts to
invest a symbolic form or cultural performance with particular, partial
meaning. Relevant constituencies share symbols and the cultural
performances in which they are orchestrated insofar as they mutually
attribute significance to that set. However, the meanings that individuals or
groups within the population attribute to the symbolic components of their
culture need not be shared. Symbolic forms, not the imperfectly shared,
occasionally idiosyncratic, frequently contested meanings attributed to
them, constitute the crucial intersubjective, public dimension of culture.</p>
      <p>
        Meanings can be shared, more or less imperfectly, within a population
or they can verge on the idiosyncratic. Indeed political acumen is properly
conceived less as the capacity to invent new symbols than as the ability to
creatively recast meanings invested in existing symbolic forms
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(Walzer
1967, 196)</xref>
        . Anyone attempting such semantic improvisation necessarily will
challenge the established meanings attributed to a symbol. And they quite
possibly will confront discordant improvisations crafted by others. Symbolic
forms do not simply express meaning. They enable social and political
actors to make, remake and, in the process, contest meanings
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Cohen
1985, 15)</xref>
        .17
Second, as should now be clear, symbolic action is conflictual. Tocqueville
brings this point home with especial force in one well known episode that he
recounts in his Recollections. There he recalls as follows the opening in
early May 1848 of the new Constituent Assembly to which he was an
elected delegate.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I should be able to call to mind the look of that Assembly at its
opening, but I find that my recollection is very blurred. . . . I can
remember only our shouting “Long Live the Republic!” fifteen times in
the course of the session in competition with one another. . . . I think
that cry was sincere on both sides, but it stood for different, even
contradictory thoughts. Everybody wanted to preserve the Republic,
but some wanted to use it for attack, and others to defend themselves
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(Tocqueville, 1987, p. 99)</xref>
        .”
Tocqueville was not a disinterested observer of this scene. Despite his
partisanship he grants that the political factions contesting the meaning of
‘the Republic’ were sincere.18 Delegates of the contending parties were not
duplicitous; they actually interpreted ‘the Republic’ and the possibilities
embodied in the political world in different, conflicting ways.
17 This line of argument has a contentious implication. It suggests that we shift theoretical
attention away from a Durkheimian inspired preoccupation with culture as a medium of
integration and instead think of symbolic forms as devices for aggregating meanings
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Cohen,
1985, 20,21)</xref>
        . Cultural symbols do not express value consensus or shared belief (Laitin 1988).
Indeed, symbolic forms do not so much represent or express pre-existing values and beliefs as
constitute the context within which individuals formulate beliefs and values. They help
structure belief (Cohen 1979, 98; Kertzer 1988, 68).
18 On republican symbolism during this period in France see
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Agulhon (1981)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Contests of this sort are essentially strategic, part of what Geertz
(1973, 316) calls “the struggle for the real.”19 Actors engaged in such
strategic contests seek, with differential facility and success, to exploit
symbolic force in order to define the context of their ongoing interactions.
Their objective is to establish as authoritative a particular and partial
conception of the world and the social and political possibilities it contains.
In the struggle for the real actors strive to command the attention and
capture the imagination of relevant others by directing the symbolic media
with which they think.</p>
      <p>
        Third, the struggle for the real is pervasive and inescapable. It takes
place across a range of arenas. For example, delegates who Tocqueville
describes mounted their struggle at center stage, publicly contesting the
range of possibilities contained in ‘the Republic’. By contrast, peasants
engaging in everyday forms of resistance are effective precisely because
they do not assail the public stage. They “typically avoid any direct
symbolic confrontation with authority.” At a more mundane, local level,
however, they too are engaged in a contest of interpretations, “a struggle
over the appropriation of symbols . . . over how the past and present should
be understood and labeled”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Scott 1985, xvi, xvii, 27, 178)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>The struggle for the real is inescapable, it is not a contingent aspect of
symbolic action. Actors have both the occasion and an incentive to take
part. Cultures afford ample opportunity for symbolic contests. Because they
are, by definition, multivocal, symbolic forms obviously invite discordant
interpretation. Moreover, “cultural systems” are not seamless.20 The
interstices that they inevitably contain provide openings for semantic
improvisation. Symbolic forms also establish a powerful incentive to engage
in the struggle for the real. They do not influence thought or action
deterministically by directly instilling individual values, beliefs or
preferences.21 Symbolic force does however circumscribe the range of
possibilities over which actors might establish values, preferences, or
beliefs. Moreover, symbolic force discriminates. It can focus attention on
certain options thereby diverting attention from others and circumscribing
possibility. It also can slacken the constraints of attention by sustaining
unrealized options in imagination. In this way it can hold out as viable or
feasible options that otherwise would not enter into consideration. In these
ways symbolic force sustains particular conceptions of political possibility
at the expense of others.22</p>
      <p>
        The struggle for the real occupies the nexus of symbol and strategy.
What is at stake in this struggle are political possibilities and the symbolic
forms that govern how actors entertain them. The struggle for the real, then,
19 When speaking of symbolic action anthropologists regularly use metaphors of
“management”, “strategy ”, “bargaining” and “negotiation.” For examples and discussion see
Johnson (1991). Metaphors are not merely literary embellishments. They structure social and
political inquiry. The metaphors that interpretive theorists deploy provide warrant for
pursuing the unexamined strategic dimensions of “symbolic action.”
20 The extent of their internal coherence and interconnectedness is an empirical question
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref28">(Geertz, 1973, 18,406–407; Turner 1974, 163)</xref>
        . It is very important not to prejudge the
extent of this internal coherence
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Barth 1989)</xref>
        .
21 Implicitly I am taking sides in a recent theoretical debate concerning cultural explanation.
Symbolic force operates in the first instance to establish the focal categories of political
interaction (Laitin 1988; Myerson, 1992) rather than to define values or preferences
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(Wildavsky 1987;1988;1992)</xref>

87).
is a struggle over power. In seeing how this is so, we can also identify
some of the vicissitudes and constraints to which participants in this
struggle are subject.
      </p>
      <p>The struggle for the real is a struggle over possibility. It is a struggle for
power. More precisely, it is a struggle for power over others, a contest to
control the media, the symbols and cultural performances, in terms of which
social and political actors conceive possibilities and fashion them into viable
alternatives. The intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics pivots
around possibility, feasibility and power.</p>
      <p>
        Recall that the notion of political possibility presupposes that agents
intentionally and deliberately seek to constitute the world in particular ways.
Intentional action is the product of “two successive filtering devices”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Elster,
1979, 113, 77)</xref>
        . The first filter specifies the “feasible set” by circumscribing
the range of abstractly possible alternatives. The feasible set, then,
consists of those options genuinely available to actors. The second filter is
the process through which actors choose from among the options in the
feasible set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strategic actors regularly contest the context of their interactions –
including the prevailing set of feasible options that it makes available
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Schelling 1960)</xref>
        . Moreover, what often is at stake in such contests are the
symbolic media through which others envision possibilities and identify
some subset of conceivable options as feasible.
      </p>
      <p>
        “After all, options are not just opened or closed. They are essentially
seen to be open or closed, and crucially seen so under particular
descriptions, descriptions that can themselves motivate or inhibit
action. . . . What one cannot envisage is difficult to choose
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Rorty,
1988, 337–38)</xref>
        .”
In any situation the “feasible” as distinct from “merely conceivable” options
are a function of what actors consider “obvious,” what they “take for granted”
and there is no general criterion for differentiating genuinely feasible from
abstractly possible options
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Schwartz 1986, 224–228)</xref>
        . The way this
distinction is drawn in particular settings is a question of power.
      </p>
      <p>Power is a relational concept. When agents exercise power they
necessarily exercise it over others. In particular, they aim to define the set
of feasible options that others consider when determining how to act.23
Thus, power differs from persuasion which aims to modify how others
evaluate alternatives. It does not directly alter another’s preferences or
beliefs regarding available options. Similarly, power differs from force which
aims to eliminate choice on the part of those subjected to it by physically
narrowing their feasible set to a single option. Power need not involve
physical constraint. It aims to influence the way others to choose a
particular course of action by modifying the alternatives available to them.</p>
      <p>
        Power can work by altering the incentive structure that actors face. It
consists, in such instances, of negative or positive inducements, threats or
offers. But power need not involve such inducements at all. Indeed, actors
can exercise power in strategic situations simply by credibly leading others
to expect that they will choose a particular course of action (Taylor 1982,
23 The discussion in this paragraph is indebted to the typology presented by Taylor (1982,
10–25).
12–13,145). Actors who can successfully coordinate the expectations of a
relevant constituency often can generate the sort of collective action needed
to sustain selective inducements in the first place
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Hardin 1990, 363,366–
69)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Coordination, however, is typically as much a matter of expectations
as incentives. Strategic actors can mutually coordinate their expectations
only by focusing attention on one among a range of alternatives. They must
create a “focal point” by endowing that option with prominence and this, in
any given instance, typically is a product of “imagination”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Schelling 1960,
58)</xref>
        . Strategic actors create focal points through symbolic action. They
invest seemingly extra-strategic particularities with significance, thereby
transforming them into symbols whose force coordinates social and political
interaction.24 They exercise power over others by symbolically structuring
their expectations. Power in this sense, operates “along the cognitive
dimension”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Lukes 1977, 68; Turner 1974, 134)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Power may be malign. “It might be said that the main function of a
system of domination is” to foreclose options, “to define what is realistic
and what is not realistic and to drive certain goals and aspirations into the
realm of the impossible, the realm of idle dreams, of wishful thinking”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Scott
1985, 326)</xref>
        . Symbolically constituted attention structures can be highly
inhibiting. They foreclose possibilities By defining alternatives to existing
arrangements as infeasible such attention structures can prevent
subordinate actors from recognizing, much less pursuing a range of
possibilities. On the other hand, even oppositional groups need to
circumscribe possibilities.25 They rely on attention structures to coordinate
their activities and potentially to divert more powerful groups. This is
precisely the strategy that the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, for example,
adopted when they both occupied the symbolic center of Argentine politics
(the Plaza from which they took their name) and did so as mothers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disclosing possibilities is a similarly equivocal process. Contesting the
bounds of political possibility crucially presumes that actors can imagine
alternatives precluded by extant definitions of the political world.
Subordinate actors are adept at this sort of symbolic action. In particular,
they demonstrate a remarkable propensity to symbolically reverse (and
thereby expose the conventional character of) prevailing social and political
arrangements
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Scott 1985, 331)</xref>
        . But if such symbolic action is pervasive, it
also underscores the observation that “in matters of social constitution the
field of possibilities is much wider than the people within each society
imagine”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(Tocqueville 1987, 76)</xref>
        .26 Symbolic reversals often are little more
24 In strategic situations not just incentive structures but “the aesthetic properties, the
historical properties, the legal and moral properties, the cultural properties, and all the other
suggestive and connotative details, can serve to focus the expectations of certain participants
on certain solutions”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Schelling 1960, 113)</xref>
        .
25 Circumstances in which “all is possible” are extraordinary. They are fleeting at best. The
telling characterization of such circumstances as “moments of madness”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(Zolberg 1972)</xref>
        specifies precisely the sorts of conceptual constraint that prevents participants from
sustaining them.
26 This sort of constrained imagination is not characteristic solely of symbolic reversals. “At
this moment several countries in Eastern Europe . . . have or about to venture into the
greatest experiment in history since t he forced Stalinist industrialization of 1929. . . . the
economic transformations envisaged in these countries ironically mirror the Communist
project. . . . They are radical: They are intended to turn upside down all the existing social
relations. And they offer a single panacea, which once waved will cure all ills. Replace
‘nationalization of the means of production’ by ‘private property’ and ‘plan’ by ‘market’ and
than that. They do not so much project an alternative set of arrangements
as, by reversing existing relations of dependency, inequity or injustice,
depict and promote their opposite
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref18">(Hirschman 1982, 95; Rorty 1988 338)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Actors who imaginatively explore unrealized possibilities confront
serious hazards even if they manage to transcend this sort of ubiquitous
constraint. Most obviously they might intentionally disregard or otherwise
neglect pragmatic or material constraints
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Follesdal 1981)</xref>
        . Thinking back to
the example with which I opened the paper, the symbolic power that
Solidarity could command was dramatically inadequate in the face of the
overwhelming military force that the regime mustered. Thus, in the spring of
1982, one Polish worker lamented: “We’ve got all the symbols, and they’ve
got all the guns and tanks.”27 Actors who neglect such material constraints
divert energy and resources into “futile exercises,” flights of fancy that at
best are compensatory. They encourage fantasy or utopian thinking in the
pejorative sense
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Rorty 1988, 341)</xref>
        .28
      </p>
      <p>
        Political actors face additional risks even where they pursue “genuine”
possibilities, alternatives that are viable in the sense of being broadly
consonant with pragmatic or material constraints. They might simply fail to
realize possible objectives. As with all intentional action, a gap always
looms between attempt and accomplishment. Conversely, having realized
alternative possibilities, relevant actors might encounter a significant gap
between the reality achieved and the possibility held out. Either eventuality
can breed disappointment and resignation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref18">(Hirschman 1982, 94; Rorty
1988, 338)</xref>
        . Either eventuality, may, in that sense, reinforce the sense of
inevitability that enshrouds the extant political world.
      </p>
      <p>The argument of this paper has been circuitous. I have argued that grappling
with the subject of political possibility requires that we examine the intimate
relation of symbol and strategy in politics. I have drawn a crucial distinction
between the ways that the ability to calculate probabilities and to entertain
possibilities enters into social and political interaction. I have identified the
mechanisms – attention and imagination – at work in the ways symbolic
forms govern our ability to envision possibilities. I have shown how political
possibility is implicated with power. And I have sketched some of the
constraints and vicissitudes that make the politics of possibility a
precarious enterprise. I now want briefly to connect my preceding argument
to the theme of antipolitics. I will make three short assertions.</p>
      <p>
        1. Antipolitics, whether conducted by formally organized collective
entities like Solidarity or by looser groupings of individuals like the Mothers
of the Plaza, is implicated in the politics of possibility. Parties to antipolitics
deploy symbolic forms with greater or lesser facility and success and they
do so for strategic purposes. They aim to redefine the political world by
recasting the bounds of political possibility in particular and partial ways.
you can leave the structure of the ideology intact. Perhaps revolutions are shaped by the very
systems against which they are directed?” (Przeworski 1991, 7).
27 Reported by Laba (1991, 148).
28 This discussion minimally requires that we differentiate imagination from fantasy.
Imagination is concerned with fashioning genuine, viable, if unrealized, alternatives. Fantasy
inclines toward the “merely possible,” toward options that, while conceivable, remain
“incredible” and consequently unrealizable
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Rorty 1988, 340–41; Wittgenstin 1967, para.
275)</xref>
        .
2. Antipolitics, insofar as it is concerned with possibilities, is a strategy in
the struggle for power. This may seem peculiar given the aversion of
spokesmen like Konrad to power politics. He claims that the “medium of
politics is power over people – power backed by weapons” (Konrad 1984,
16). And he asserts that “No thinking person should want to drive others
from positions of political power in order to occupy them himself” (Konrad
1984, 119). Yet since antipolitics of the sort in which Solidarity or the
Mothers of the Plaza engage entails participation in the “struggle for the
real”, this suspicion of power is simply misplaced.29
      </p>
      <p>
        3. It is easy to find pessimists, those who view the struggle for the real
and the efforts to redefine political possibility that it entails as inherently
dangerous. But it is not easy to find alternatives. In politics symbol and
strategy are related in inescapable ways. So, for example, the invention of
traditions is a pervasive strategic move in politics.30 But observers of
politics in post-communist East Central Europe typically express suspicion
of political actors who invoke tradition
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref17">(Gyani 1993; Jaworski 1985)</xref>
        . They
rarely consider whether, in such highly indeterminant political
circumstances, it might be possible to invent normatively appealing
traditions. I have in mind here, for instance, a tradition of constitutionalism
(Johnson 1994). We must, as the brochure for this conference suggests, be
wary of antipolitical mobilizations that threaten to derail the emergence or
stability of liberal democratic political arrangements. However, the most
effective response to such mobilizations is to engage in the politics of
possibility. And this means recognizing the need to effectively exercise the
power that emerges at the intersection of symbol and strategy.
29 It may be more appropriate to say that Konrad really is opposed to force as a final
guarantor of political arrangements. But we should not let his invocation of “spiritual
authority” or “moral opposition” (Konrad 1984, 119,122) blind us to the fact that
antipolitics is part of the “struggle for the real” and hence is a struggle for power. Both
Solidarity and the Mothers of the Plaza invoked spiritual authority in the face of authoritarian
rule. But they did so in hopes of expanding the range of political possibilities beyond those
sanctioned by extant political arrangements.
