        <p>Criticism is an important aspect of communication within and between groups, but reactions to criticism of groups have been little studied. Past research has shown that criticism elicits greater sensitivity when made by an outgroup member, compared to an ingroup member. Two experiments were conducted to examine how this intergroup sensitivity effect (ISE) is affected by the context of the criticism. Experiment 1 showed that the ISE occurs in a private context, but disappears when it is clear that the criticism is made to a large public audience. Experiment 2 investigated intragroup criticism and manipulated both audience size and audience composition. Results showed that ingroup criticism elicited greater sensitivity and less favorable evaluations of the speaker when made to an outgroup rather than an ingroup audience. The results highlight strategic considerations and tacit protocols governing the criticism of groups.</p>

Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that people

the esteem in which they are held

      <p>
        Explicit criticism of the ingroup is a very
direct and potent threat to the image of the
group. However, until very recently researchers
have largely ignored the important issue of how
people respond to criticisms of their group.
Theoretically, a key determinant of how group
criticism is received ought to be its source:
specifically whether it comes from an ingroup
member (i.e. intragroup criticism) or an
outgroup member (i.e. intergroup criticism).
Intragroup criticism, although painful, helps
the group to identify and rectify its weaknesses,
facilitating growth, change, and improvement
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(see also Nemeth &amp; Owens, 1996)</xref>
        . This kind of
communication is analogous to intrapsychic
processes such as considered reflection and
self-criticism
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref4">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 1999; Kurman,
2003)</xref>
        . Subjecting one’s group to reasonable
criticism therefore may be a valuable means of
furthering its interests. In kind, fellow ingroup
members may be willing to entertain
intragroup criticisms, regarding them as probably
well-informed and well-intentioned. On the
other hand, criticism from an outgroup
member is more likely to be seen as a malicious
attack, perhaps aimed at bolstering the
outgroup’s relative status, and as such is likely
to arouse hostility
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref3 ref39">(e.g. Bourhis, Giles, Leyens,
&amp; Tajfel, 1979; Grant, 1992)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other grounds to expect that
ingroup criticisms will be preferred to outgroup
criticisms. For example, leaders who are more
prototypical of their group find it easier to
achieve influence over their fellow group
members, as they are seen to have their group’s
interests at heart
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Hogg &amp; van Knippenberg,
2003)</xref>
        . By analogy, ingroup members also tend
to be more prototypical of the group than
outgroup members. Also, when evaluating
persuasive messages
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref49">(Eagly, Wood, &amp; Chaiken,
1978; Wood &amp; Eagly, 1981)</xref>
        and attempts at
ingratiation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46 ref47">(Vonk, 1998, 2002)</xref>
        , observers are
strongly affected by what they perceive to be the
target person’s motives. Indeed these findings
are consistent with contemporary theories of
communication in which the perception of
speakers’ motives is crucial for successful
comprehension and evaluation of their messages
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref12 ref16 ref9">(Albright, Cohen, Malloy, Christ, &amp; Bromgard,
2004; Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2004; Higgins, 1981)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Hornsey, Oppes, and Svensson (2002)
conducted the first empirical investigation of these
issues. They presented criticisms of ingroups
(Australians, students), manipulating the
source to which those criticisms were attributed
—specifically, an ingroup member (i.e.
intragroup criticism) or an outgroup member (i.e.
intergroup criticism). Hornsey et al. found that
intragroup criticisms were tolerated rather
graciously; indeed ingroup speakers were judged
as favorably when they criticized the group as
when they praised it. However, whereas
speakers who praised the ingroup were rated
equally as favorably whether or not they
belonged to the group, outgroup critics were
judged more harshly than their ingroup
equivalents. In short, criticisms were welcomed when
made by ingroup members but met with
sensitivity and defensiveness when made by
outgroup members.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Hornsey et al. (2002)</xref>
        found this intergroup sensitivity effect (ISE)
(p. 299) to be mediated by perceptions that
intragroup criticism is better informed and
intentioned than intergroup criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
        These findings were mirrored by those
published more or less simultaneously by O’Dwyer,
Berkowitz, and Alfeld-Johnson (2002). These
revealed greater hostility towards the critic,
higher levels of anger, and less agreement with
the criticism when the critic was a member of
the outgroup rather than an ingroup member.
Subsequently Hornsey, Trembath and
Gunthorpe (2004) have shown that criticisms are
only welcomed from ingroup members who are
highly identified with or committed to their
group. This result underscores the importance
of the motives that are perceived to underlie
criticisms. Similarly,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref21">Hornsey and Imani (2004)</xref>
        found that outgroup critics were not tolerated
even when they were as knowledgeable about
the group as ingroup members, suggesting that
motives and not experience are strongly
predictive of sensitivity.

        <p>
          Although internal criticism can be a valuable
aspect of group functioning, it carries with it
certain risks.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Hornsey et al. (2002)</xref>
          suggest that
‘ingroup criticism will be tolerated to the extent
that it is not making the group vulnerable to
attack from other groups’ (p. 305). This
suggests that if ingroup criticism is perceived to
make the group susceptible to outgroup
derogation, then it could evoke as much sensitivity
as outgroup criticism. Such an instance might
occur when the criticism appears in public to a
large audience. The criticism is then available
not only to ingroup members, who might make
constructive use of it, but is also available to
members of other groups whose impression of
the ingroup may be adversely affected, and who
may use the comments to their advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          This distinction between public and private
communication has generated considerable
research in the domain of individuals’
presentations of themselves
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref37 ref43">(e.g. Schlenker &amp; Wowra,
2003; Sedikides, Herbst, Hardin, &amp; Dardis,
2002; Tice, 1992)</xref>
          . This research has shown that
individuals are acutely aware of the strategic
implications of communicating publicly as
opposed to privately, and adjust their
selfpresentations accordingly
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref35">(e.g. Baumeister,
1982; Schlenker, 1980)</xref>
          . For instance,
individuals consider the group membership of the
audience before expressing prejudiced views or
opinions
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref6">(Crandall, Eshelman, &amp; O’Brien,
2002; Klein, Licata, Azzi, &amp; Durala, 2003)</xref>
          .
Furthermore,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">Tetlock (1981)</xref>
          showed that
participants’ public attributions for their actions
seemed tailor-made to create favorable
impressions in others. In the group domain, group
members represented themselves as less
important than their colleagues in causing the
group to succeed while privately they believed
themselves to be just as important
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(Miller &amp;
Schlenker, 1985)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent research suggests that as well as
managing impressions of themselves, people
manage impressions of their group, responding
to the communicative context in doing so
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25 ref34 ref7">(Douglas &amp; McGarty, 2001; Lambert, Cronen,
Chasteen, &amp; Lickel, 1996; Reicher, Spears, &amp;
Postmes, 1995)</xref>
          . One reason for this might be
that people are aware of the representations of
their group held by relevant outgroups; namely
‘meta-stereotypes’
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">(Vorauer, Main, &amp;
O’Connell, 1998, p. 917)</xref>
          . Individuals have a vested
interest in these ‘meta-stereotypes’, because if
they are negative, they threaten one’s valued
social identity, self-esteem, and the material
interests of the group. Individuals may also find
it harder to create and maintain a positive
public presentation of themselves when they
are a member of a devalued group
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref5">(Cialdini &amp;
Richardson, 1981; Eidelman &amp; Biernat, 2003)</xref>
          .
Consistent with these concerns,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Klein and Azzi
(2001)</xref>
          found that when meta-stereotypes were
salient and when individuals thought that their
responses would be available to outgroup
members, they selected more positive traits and
fewer negative traits as descriptors of the
ingroup.
        </p>
        <p>
          These findings raise an interesting and thus
far unanswered question. Given the collective
interest of members in the image of the group,
does the tendency to present one’s group
favorably in public settings take on something
of the status of a prescriptive norm? That is, do
people react adversely to criticism of their
group by fellow group members when it occurs
publicly? In sociological field studies of groups
such as hotel workers,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Goffman (1959)</xref>
          noted a
norm of refraining from criticizing each other
in front of outgroup audiences such as hotel
guests. He attributed this to a collective desire
to cooperate in a dramaturgical presentation of
the group to outsiders. According to Goffman,
when intragroup criticisms were made publicly,
one effect was ‘to provide the audience with a
back-stage view’, and another was ‘to leave the
feeling that something is surely suspicious
about a performance when those who know
best do not agree’ (p. 185).
Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations 8(3)
of the message (public/private) in a single,
between-groups design.1 We reasoned that
individuals may tolerate or even value intragroup
criticism when it is not available to outsiders,
but may resent it when the image of the group
is potentially harmed by public criticism. Thus
we expect that the ISE will occur for criticisms
made in private but not in public contexts.
        </p>
        <sec id="sec-2-1-1">
          <title>Method</title>
          <p>Participants and design Participants were 203
undergraduate students recruited on Keele
University campus while at leisure (64 males,
139 females, M = 19.09 years of age, SD = 1.42).</p>
          <p>The experiment consisted of a 2 (source:
ingroup/outgroup) 2 (context: private/
public) between-groups design. Participants
were randomly assigned to conditions.</p>
          <p>
            Analogously in social psychology, we have
indirect evidence that by refraining from
endorsing negative stereotypes before
outgroup audiences, people exhibit at least a
tacit awareness that their words and deeds will
affect the image of their group
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(cf. Klein &amp;
Azzi, 2001)</xref>
            . They are likely to perceive that
public criticism adversely affects the valued
meta-stereotype
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">(Vorauer et al., 1998)</xref>
            .
Therefore when people publicly criticize their group,
fellow ingroup members may respond harshly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the present research, we examine the
importance of the context of communication in
shaping reactions to intragroup and intergroup
criticisms. To date, no research has addressed
this issue; manipulations have addressed the
group membership of the speaker
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Hornsey
et al., 2002)</xref>
            , the extent to which the speaker
identifies with the group
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref21">(Hornsey et al., 2004)</xref>
            ,
and the extent to which the speaker has
personal experience of the group
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref21">(Hornsey &amp;
Imani, 2004)</xref>
            . In these studies by Hornsey and
colleagues, the context of criticisms has been
ambiguous, described as taking place in an
interview, but where the audience privy to the
interview was not made explicit. In the study by
O’Dwyer et al. (2002), stimulus criticisms had
allegedly been published in the critic’s school
newspaper. This meant that the criticisms were
made publicly but to an inclusive ingroup
audience (relative to the critic). Although the
only intended manipulation was the source of
the criticism, the audience differed across
conditions as well. The current research aims to
systematically examine the role of context in
moderating reactions to criticism from ingroup
and outgroup members. Specifically,
Experiment 1 manipulates the context of the
audience (criticism appears in private versus
public domains) and the source of the criticism
(ingroup or outgroup member). Experiment 2
breaks down the context of the criticism by
separating the size of the audience and the
composition of the audience.
          </p>
          <p>Materials and procedure As in Hornsey and
colleagues’ research (2002), participants were
informed that the study was designed to
examine people’s perceptions of personality
types. On the first page participants received
identical instructions in all four conditions,
except for one line that was specific for the
condition assigned, which read ‘these comments
were spoken by an undergraduate [someone
who didn’t go to university], in a private
conversation [and appeared in a national
newspaper]’.</p>
          <p>The first line of the second page outlined
the group membership of the critic and the
context in which the comments were spoken.</p>
          <p>For example, for the ingroup private condition
participants read: ‘David Sanderson is a
20-year-old second year undergraduate student
[office manager who decided against going to
university]. In a private conversation [in a
national newspaper], he made these comments
about students’ (alternative wording for
outgroup critic and public context appears in
parentheses).</p>
          <p>Participants were then presented with
comments attributed to the speaker which were
Experiment 1 based on negative press comments from the
media concerning students’ activities while at
Here we manipulate both the source of the university. This criticism was used because of
message (ingroup/outgroup) and the context the likelihood that it would tap a salient and
commonly held stereotype. Comments from
the ingroup member were presented as coming
from a 20-year-old undergraduate student
called David Sanderson, who said:
‘Most of us are from privileged, middle-class
backgrounds, but we expect the taxpayer to support us.</p>
          <p>Many of us just drift into university because of
parental pressure or simply because we want to get
drunk and party. About 50% of students show up
to the average lecture and seminar; much of the
absenteeism is down to the fact that we’re either
spending our time and money in the pub, or we’re
hungover from the night before.’</p>
          <p>Speaking about the current controversy on fees,
Mr Sanderson said, ‘I strongly support top-up fees.</p>
          <p>We benefit from our education, and so should pay
for it. If fees were increased only those who are
really serious about their studies would go to
university. The universities would also be able to put
on better classes’.</p>
          <p>For the outgroup condition David Sanderson
used third-person pronouns (‘them’ and
‘they’) instead of first-person pronouns (‘us’
and ‘we’). The outgroup critic was allocated the
status of office manager in order to try and
match his status with that of a university
student. If his title would have been office
worker or office cleaner then ingroup members
may perceive the comments as ‘sour grapes’
because his position in society is lower than
what they would hope to achieve, making his
criticism easier to dismiss.</p>
          <p>Once participants read the comments, they
were presented with Hornsey et al.’s (2002)
sensitivity scale. Participants were asked ‘to
what extent do you think the comments were’:
(followed by the words) ‘threatening’,
‘disappointing’, ‘irritating’, ‘offensive’, ‘insulting’,
‘hypocritical’, ‘judgmental’ and ‘arrogant’.</p>
          <p>Participants responded on a Likert scale (1 =
not at all, 7 = very much). The sensitivity scale was
reliable = .82.</p>
          <p>In addition we also measured the anger felt
by the participants after reading the comments,
using the four-item scale by O’Dwyer et al.
(2002), for example: ‘How annoyed do you feel
after reading these comments?’ ( = .88). A
single item was also included to assess
participants’ agreement with the speaker’s comments.</p>
          <p>This was measured by asking: ‘how much do</p>
          <p>
            Elder et al. audiences of group criticism
you agree with the comments?’
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Hornsey et al.,
2002)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>Questions were then asked to tap into
participants’ perceptions of the speaker. These
questions related to the morality of the critic,
the critic’s motive, competency of the critic, and
the effect of the critic’s comments. Morality was
measured because it may be possible that
participants believe that by going public with
criticism of their ingroup the speaker is breaking
some form of moral code. The morality items
were: ‘the speaker should make comments like
these’, ‘it was wrong of the speaker to make
these comments’ (reverse coded), and ‘by
making these comments the speaker was doing
the right thing’ ( = .68). Motive was assessed
because when an ingroup member criticizes
their group publicly their intentions may be seen
as less honorable. Motive was measured using
the following four questions: ‘this speaker had
students’ interests at heart’, ‘this speaker’s
intentions were honorable’, ‘this speaker’s
comments were intended to benefit students’
and ‘this speaker was trying to be constructive’
( = .75). Competency was included because
previous research has shown critics’ group
membership to affect perceptions of how
qualified they are to comment on the group.
Competency was measured with the following items:
‘the speaker’s comments were well-informed’,
‘the speaker was qualified to make these
comments’ and ‘this speaker has enough
experience of students to make these
comments’ ( = .80). The first two items were
adapted from Hornsey et al.’s legitimacy scale.</p>
          <p>The final scale was included to measure the
perceived effect of the comments, given that
public criticism could be perceived as having a
more negative effect on the group than private
criticism. The effect items were: ‘this speaker’s
comments will positively affect students’ image’,
‘this speaker’s comments will have a positive
impact on university education’, and ‘this
speaker’s comments will benefit students’ ( =
.69). These scales appeared together, in
random order, and participants responded on a
Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly
agree). Once participants completed these
questions they were thanked and debriefed.</p>

          Preliminary analyses To verify that our
dependent measures assessed separate constructs, and
to identify any problematic cross-mappings, we
subjected our measures to factor analyses. To
verify that sensitivity

anger
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(O’Dwyer et al., 2002)</xref>
          are different
constructs, we entered all items from both scales
into a factor analysis. As these two constructs
were interrelated (r = .516), we used oblique
rotation. This produced a two-factor solution,
with the first factor comprising the anger items
(eigenvalue = 5.05, 42.10% of the variance
explained) and the second factor including the
sensitivity items (eigenvalue = 1.65, 13.75% of
the variance explained). Therefore, these scales
were treated as separate constructs.
        </p>
        <p>A similar analysis was used to determine
whether motive, effect, competency, and
morality scales assessed the intended
constructs. Once more oblique rotation was used
given that these constructs tended to be
interrelated (r = .003 to .517 with the average
correlation approximately .30). This revealed a
three-factor solution, with the first factor
comprising the motive and effect items (eigenvalue
= 4.30, 33.09% of the variance explained) and
the second factor the competency items
(eigenvalue = 1.91, 14.72% of the variance explained).</p>
        <p>Because both effect and motive loaded on the
same factor, we combined these scales into a
single scale we labelled consequences. This new
scale combined the effect of the comments as
estimated by the participants and as perceived
to be intended by the speaker ( = .80). This
close correspondence in motives and effect
suggests that participants believe the speaker to
have intended or at least to have been aware of
the likely effect of his or her comments. The
third factor comprised the morality items
(eigenvalue = 1.30, 9.29% of the variance
explained). We therefore analyzed results for
consequences, competency, and morality.</p>

      <p>In many instances the communicative
context and the composition of the audience
are naturally confounded. Private comments
are often accessible only to ingroup members,
whereas comments made publicly tend to be
accessible to people from different groups.
However context and composition are
conceptually separable, and are separable in practice
too. Given that we tend to belong to a
multitude of social groups, it is probably quite
common for people to talk about their own
group, in private, to outgroup members. To
illustrate, it is quite likely that students talk
about other students when at home with their
families. Further, some communicative settings
are importantly public, but at the same time
unlikely to be scrutinized by outgroup
members. For example, internet sites for
special interest groups are available to the
public but not likely to be regularly inhabited
by outgroup members. Comments made in
such contexts are public but may well find a
purely ingroup audience. So public
communication does not always entail intergroup
communication, even if public communication
entails the possibility that outgroup members
will receive the message.</p>
      <p>It is the aim of this experiment to tease apart
the variables of audience size and composition,
which are somewhat confounded in the first
experiment. Therefore, it manipulates both the
size of the audience (context is public or
private) and composition of the audience
(audience consists of ingroup or outgroup
members), in a fully between-groups design. As
there was no effect of context for the outgroup
critic in the first experiment, all criticism in the
next experiment will be presented as
intragroup criticism.</p>
      <p>
        There are also other methodological changes
in this experiment. In both the pilot study1 and
the first experiment the critic advocated
increased tuition fees as part of their criticism
of students. This issue of ‘top-up’ fees was
particularly topical at the time and helped to
contextualize the criticism. However, we were
concerned that this suggested implementation
of a policy that would hurt students’ interests
could be responsible for increased sensitivity in
public contexts. Therefore, the current
experiment manipulated whether or not the
comments about top-up fees were included in
the criticisms. We also included an additional
scale by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Hornsey et al. (2002)</xref>
        to examine
whether perceptions of the speaker’s
personality would differ depending on the context of
the criticism.
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Method</title>
        <p>Participants and design Participants were 200
undergraduate students (70 male, 130 female,
M = 19.80 years of age, SD = 3.31). Of these, 100
were psychology students who participated to
fulfill course credits and the remainder
recruited on Keele University campus while at
leisure. The experiment consisted of a 2
(audience composition: ingroup/outgroup)
2 (audience size: small/large) between-subjects
design. Participants were randomly assigned to
the four conditions.</p>
        <p>Materials and procedure Participants received
identical instructions in all conditions except
those specific to the condition assigned. For
example, in the large ingroup audience
condition it stated that: ‘These comments were spoken
by an undergraduate student interviewed on student
radio [Radio 2] where less than 1% of listeners are
non-students [students]’. Alternatively, for the
smaller ingroup audience condition the
instructions were: ‘These comments were spoken by
an undergraduate student, in a private conversation
with only other students [non-students] present’.</p>
        <p>Participants then turned the page and were
informed of the audience size and composition.
For example, in the small audience condition
participants were informed that: ‘Whilst in a
private conversation in his halls of residence with only
other students present [with his family and friends
who are not students], he made these comments about
students’. In the large audience condition this
read: ‘Whilst being interviewed on student radio
[Radio 2], he made these comments about students’.</p>
        <p>Participants then proceeded to read the same
negative script about students as in Experiment
1, except that for half the participants, the
commentary concerning top-up fees was deleted
from the criticism. Measures were also identical
to Experiment 1 except for the inclusion of
Hornsey et al.’s (2002) personality evaluation
scale. This asked ‘to what extent do you think
the speaker is’: (followed by the words)
‘intelligent’, ‘trustworthy’, ‘friendly’, ‘open-minded’,
‘likeable’, ‘nice’, ‘respected’, and ‘interesting’
( = .88). Participants completed the same
sensitivity ( = .90), anger ( = .96), motives
( = .77), morality ( = .70), competency ( =
.78), and effect ( = .66) scales, as well as the
agreement item.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>Results and discussion</title>
        <p>Preliminary analyses Initial factor analyses
also replicated the factor structures observed
for Experiment 1 and showed Hornsey et al.’s
(2002) personality evaluation scale to be
distinct from other measures. In order to rule
out the possibility that commentary concerning
top-up fees in the script was altering reactions
to the criticism, we also conducted initial
ANOVAs including this factor (top-up fees:
included/excluded). For sensitivity, there was
no main effect of top-up fees (F(1, 192) = 3.29,
Elder et al.
p = .079), nor crucially any interaction with
audience composition (F(1, 192) = .73, p = .39);
or audience size (F(1, 192) = .11, p = .74); and
no three-way interaction between top-up fees,
audience composition, and size (F(1, 192) =
.001, p = .98). Similarly, for personality
evaluations, there was no main effect of top-up fees
(F(1, 192) = .10, p = .75), nor any interaction
with audience composition (F(1, 192) = 1.42,
p = .24); or audience size (F(1, 192) = .002,
p = .96); and no three-way interaction between
top-up fees, audience composition, and size
(F(1, 192) = 2.02, p = .16). Therefore, top-up
fees as a variable was dropped from further
analyses.</p>

sensitive to criticism of their group when there
was an outgroup audience (M = 4.67) than
when there was an ingroup audience (M = 4.32)
(p = .040, 2 = .022). Ingroup members do not
want the group’s shortcomings to be heard by
outsiders. However, for sensitivity there was no
main effect of audience size. This suggests that
the composition of the audience, and not its
size, affects sensitivity. The results also show, as
in Experiment 1, sensitivity is greatest when the
outgroup critic speaks to a small outgroup
audience, perhaps because ingroup members
are not able to respond to the criticism.</p>
        <p>
          Participants were also more angered by
the critic’s comments when they were spoken
to the outgroup audience (M = 4.04) than to
the ingroup audience (M = 3.54) (p = .039,
2 = .022). For agreement, there were no main
effects or interactions for audience
composition and audience size. Thus, although the
source of otherwise identical messages affects
agreement
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Experiment 1; also see Hornsey
et al., 2002)</xref>
          , characteristics of the perceived
audience do not. Clearly, source and context
have different effects on evaluative reactions to
comments.
        </p>
        <p>Main effects and interactions for evaluations
of the speaker As suggested by our factor
analyses, motive and effect were combined into
a single scale we labeled consequences ( = .83).
For consequences of the criticism, there was a
main effect of audience composition, with
more positive consequences perceived when
the speaker addressed an ingroup audience
(M = 3.03) compared with an outgroup
audience (M = 2.71) (p = .018, 2 = .029). In
addition, when the critic spoke to the ingroup
audience he was perceived as more moral (M =
4.07) than when he spoke to the outgroup
audience (M = 3.82), although this effect was
marginal (p = .09, 2 = .014). For morality there
was also a main effect of audience size with
participants perceiving the speaker as
possessing greater morality when speaking to a small
audience (M = 4.38) than when speaking to a
large audience (M = 3.52) (p = .001, 2 = .140).
This supports the suggestion that the moral rules
or norms governing intragroup communication
are dependent on the social context in which
the comments are expressed. If the speaker
goes ‘on the record’ and speaks to a large
audience then they may no longer be perceived
as doing what is right for the group. The
ingroup speaker was also perceived as more
competent when criticizing the group to an
ingroup audience (M = 3.74) than to an
outgroup audience (M = 3.30) (p = .011, 2 =
.033). This suggests that although the criticisms
presented were identical, the speaker was
perceived as having greater experience and
qualifications to make these negative comments about
their own group when they kept the criticism
‘in house’. As predicted, there was a significant
main effect of audience for ratings of
personality evaluations. Finally, participants evaluated
the ingroup critic’s personality more favorably
when he criticized the group before ingroup
members (M = 3.69) rather than outgroup
members (M = 3.37) (p = .015, 2 = .030). Again,
this is consistent with our rationale that
participants will not perceive the speaker favorably
when the criticism is taken beyond the confines
of the ingroup.</p>
        <sec id="sec-4-2-1">
          <title>General discussion</title>
          <p>
            The current research is the first to assess the
impact of communicative context on reactions
to intergroup and intragroup criticism. Our
first experiment manipulated both the source
of the criticism (ingroup versus outgroup
speaker) and the context of the criticism
(public versus private) and showed that the ISE
only occurred when criticisms were made in
private. When the comments appeared in
public they were no more welcomed from an
ingroup member than from an outgroup
member. The second experiment aimed to
clarify whether the preference for private
ingroup criticism was due to the smaller size of
the audience or the fact that it was composed
of ingroup rather than outgroup members. The
findings demonstrated that increased sensitivity
and derogation of the speaker was associated
with taking the criticism to outsiders.
Therefore, it seems that an ingroup critic speaking
to an ingroup audience is seen as ‘clearing the
air’ by highlighting the group’s weaknesses,
thereby promoting growth and improvement
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(see Nemeth &amp; Owens, 1996)</xref>
            , but when
speaking to an outgroup audience, he or she
is perceived to be ‘airing the group’s dirty
laundry’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our replication of the ISE supports
theoretical claims that there are norms governing
intergroup criticism
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref20">(Hornsey et al., 2002; see also
Franco &amp; Maass, 1996)</xref>
            . Our demonstration
that this effect disappears in public, where
ingroup critics are less well received, suggests
that there are also norms governing intragroup
criticism. The norms governing each kind of
criticism appear to be somewhat different;
while reactions to intergroup criticism were not
greatly affected by the context in which it
appeared, participants were clearly more
piqued by intragroup criticism that could reach
an outgroup audience. Indeed, intragroup
criticism was judged to be less moral when made in
public, showing that people are perceived to be
less entitled to criticize their group in public
than in private. Furthermore, intragroup
criticism before an outgroup audience was
perceived as having more negative consequences
and the speaker was judged to be less
competent than when the criticism was made to an
ingroup audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            These findings are consistent with a
normative expectation that group members should
collaborate to foster a desired public image of
their group
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref22">(Goffman, 1959; Klein &amp; Azzi,
2001)</xref>
            . Criticizing one’s own group in public
may affirm negative meta-stereotypes to the
detriment of the group
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">(Vorauer et al., 1998)</xref>
            .
These findings also suggest that when people
speak to outgroup members about their
ingroup’s weaknesses, this can change our
perceptions of the speaker’s motivations and
personality. In this context we no longer see them
as well-intentioned and well-informed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The effects of context and source on
reactions to criticism found in the present
experiments demonstrate the impact of
specifically communicative variables on reactions to
group criticism. For example, people’s
tolerance of criticism may differ depending on
whether the critic is identifiable. Identifiability
has a range of implications for how ingroup
and outgroup members are perceived and
treated. Intuitively, one might expect greater
tolerance of identifiable critics on the grounds
that they are prepared to be accountable for
their comments, but in fact this may interact
with source and context
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32 ref33 ref34 ref7">(Douglas &amp; McGarty,
2001; Reicher &amp; Levine, 1994a, 1994b; Reicher
et al., 1995)</xref>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            Another potential moderating variable is the
status of the outgroup speaker. In Experiment
1 we described the ingroup critic as a
20-yearold undergraduate student and the outgroup
critic as a 20-year-old office manager who
decided against going to university. The aim
was to try and match the two critics in terms of
both age and status. However, recent research
suggests that speakers’ perceived status can
moderate the ISE
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(Tarrant, 2005)</xref>
            . We therefore
acknowledge that it may have been
advantageous in the first experiment to use multiple
outgroup speakers of different status
randomized across conditions.
          </p>
          <p>To conclude, the present findings show that
reactions to intragroup and intergroup
criticism depend importantly on the context in
which criticism appears. Criticisms seem to be
preferred from ingroup members rather than
outgroup members, but not when taken into
the intergroup domain. This preference strikes
us as being, to a large degree, rational; making
criticisms of one’s group in public contexts
where they are available to outgroup members
would indeed appear to put the group’s image
at risk, with little benefit to the ingroup relative
to more discreet forms of communication. Our
results point to a rather subtle set of norms
governing the criticism of groups, and
highlight the interaction between communicative
factors such as source and context. In doing so,
they underscore the essentially communicative
nature of group processes and intergroup
relations.</p>

analyzed as a two-group between-subjects design

criticisms from an outgroup member resulted in
greater sensitivity (M = 4.87) than when the same
