      <title>Uganda: The Mabira Forest Case</title>
      <p>
        Patrick Hönig
Abstract: Over the past few years, the Ugandan government has
repeatedly initiated proceedings to clear one-fourth of the Mabira natural forest
reserve in central Uganda and give the land to a sugar company
controlled by a transnational business conglomerate. Each time the
government took steps to execute the Mabira project, civil society groups
organised large-scale protests that pressurised the government into shelving
its plans. The Save Mabira Forest campaign has been widely cited as an
example of how sustained protests by civil society groups serve as a
corrective of democratic deficits in decision-making processes pertaining
to the commons and as a deterrent to profit-driven business schemes
hatched in collusion with carefree or corrupt bureaucrats and politicians.
However, an in-depth analysis of the campaign suggests that ecological
and social justice concerns are mixed up with identity politics and
exclusionist agendas. Examining the complex web of interactions between
state, big business and civil society in Uganda, this paper sheds light on
the multi-layered and often ambiguous role played by non-governmental
organisations in post-conflict societies of sub-Saharan Africa.
There is a growing consensus that policy-making on the use of the
commons – land, air and water – requires a careful calibration of
environmental, developmental and political concerns. However, as Polack
and others (2013: 1-7) have noted, large-scale acquisition of land by
transnational companies operating in Africa continues to occur with
“minimal consultation and transparency”. There are significant research
gaps in the way long-term effects of land allotment for agro-industrial
use are assessed, which in turn leads to less stringent risk assessment.
Authors such as Muna
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">Ndulo (2011)</xref>
        have convincingly shown that the
adoption of neoliberal policies in aid-dependent countries of
sub-Saharan Africa has created a political climate that allows corporations to
push through their agendas, sometimes even at the cost of violating legal
standards and human rights. At the same time, there is growing
recognition that civil society groups in sub-Saharan Africa have started to assert
themselves at the policy-making level and fill a governance void left by
states prepared to delegate their responsibilities
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">(Opoku-Mensah 2008)</xref>
        .
Against that background, governance of the commons has become an
important area in which opposing interests play out and clash.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pointing to governance as the core problem of dealing with the
commons, Elinor
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">Ostrom (1990</xref>
        : 8-18) observes that there is a wide
spectrum of opinions. On one side, analysts have argued that effective
management of the commons requires long-term strategies that private actors
adapting to ever-changing market conditions are ill-equipped to bring to
fruition. Ostrom notes that this school of thought sees no alternative to
state institutions applying coercive force in governing the commons.
Meanwhile, those at the other end of the spectrum claim that it is
necessary to eliminate all public control and establish unconditional property
rights regimes over divisible common pool resources such as land. The
ramifications of the various positions, including Ostrum’s own viewpoint
that builds on the notion that “many solutions exist to cope with many
different problems”, will need to be discussed elsewhere. For the
purposes of this paper, it will suffice to note that there has been
considerable research into developing models of governance in areas of limited
statehood, centring on the structural and political conditions in which
power is generated and decisions are formed
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">(Risse 2011)</xref>
        . Academic
writing has moved beyond binaries pitting state against non-state actors.
      </p>
      <p>Using the Save Mabira Forest (SMF) campaign in Uganda as a case
study, this paper seeks to make an empirical contribution to the largely
theoretical discussion about the nature of the state and civil society in
sub-Saharan Africa and the processes of political decision-making. It will
(a) present an account of the Mabira Forest project and the rationale
behind it; (b) describe the components and triggers of the Save Mabira
Forest campaign; (c) explain the crisis of the state in Uganda; (d) discuss
the ramifications of civil society movements; and (e) link the empirical
findings to the discourse on governing the commons. The engagement
with media reports and scholarly work is balanced by background
interviews on the functioning of civil society that I conducted in Uganda and
neighbouring countries during field trips in five consecutive years
starting in 2008.1</p>

        <title>The Mabira Forest Project</title>
        <p>In early 2007, the Ugandan government announced that it would
degazette and clear one-quarter of Mabira Central Forest Reserve – the
largest nature reserve in Central Uganda – and give the land to the Sugar
Corporation of Uganda Ltd (SCOUL), jointly owned by a private
investor and the Ugandan state, to cultivate sugarcane. Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni justified this decision on the grounds that the country
needed to expand its agricultural and industrial sectors, create incentives
for foreign direct investment and boost the economy.2 A letter that the
president had allegedly written to MPs of his party was leaked to the
press, presumably by his own office. In the letter, the authenticity of
which the presidency never confirmed or denied, Museveni gave a
threefold explanation for the proposed leasing out of Mabira land. First, he
argued that granting land to SCOUL would create jobs. Second, he
maintained that the success of the country’s economy depended on the
Ugandan Asian business community, which had been expelled under Idi
Amin and the reinstatement of which had been a central concern of his
government from the beginning. Third, he claimed that in order for
businesses in Uganda to compete with China, India and other developing
countries, they had to lower costs and expand. In the case at hand, forest

apprehension about a government clamp-down on critical civil society organisations
and media, I have not revealed the identity of my interlocutors in civil society
circles.</p>
        <p>Listing infrastructure development, agricultural production and employment as

land had to be given away, according to the president, as no other land
was available.3</p>
        <p>
          Museveni’s line of argument follows a neoliberal logic holding that
what is good for business is good for the country. There appears to be
no place in his thinking for the concerns of local communities, which are
so vital for sustainable development centred on the protection of the
commons.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">Baden and Stroup (1977</xref>
          : 235) sum up the tension resulting
from the impossibility of quantifying the value of using the commons for
non-extractive purposes as follows: “We know, for example, how much
people are willing to sacrifice for a thousand board feet of lumber, but
how much would they pay for a day’s access to a wilderness area?” The
Ugandan government’s path dependency explains why it is unwilling to
consider leaving Mabira Forest alone, for no other reason than
preserving an untouched part of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Countering such criticism, the Ugandan government has argued that
the part of Mabira Forest being allocated to private concession either
does not belong to the natural forest or belongs to a degraded part of it.
However, the government has not addressed reports indicating that
illegal logging is being carried out alongside the logging for which
concession has been granted. In 2012, sources on the ground informed that
twenty lorry loads of illegally logged timber were being hauled from
Mabira on a weekly basis.4 Even if the extent of illegal logging is hard to
verify independently, it is difficult to deny that it is indeed happening.

show a significant decrease of forest cover in the area

        <title>The Save Mabira Forest Campaign</title>
        <p>
          The Save Mabira Forest (SMF) campaign has gained international
visibility for opposing the Ugandan government and questioning its stance
on governing the commons. The decision to allow SCOUL to take over
7,100 hectares of Mabira Forest met with bitter resistance on the part of
a cross-section of public institutions, political actors and CSOs. More
awkwardly, even the heads of the National Environment Management
Agency (NEMA) and the National Forestry Authority (NFA) rejected
the government proposals as ecologically imprudent, arguing that the
environmental impact of cutting trees in an area more than twenty times
the size of Central Park in Manhattan was likely going to be significant
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">(Price 2007)</xref>
          . The NFA executive director, and later the entire board,
resigned over the Mabira issue, citing political interference.
        </p>
        <p>The SMF campaign soon turned into a mass mobilisation of
unprecedented scale, pitting the Ugandan government against a range of CSOs,
international donors, the political opposition, the Buganda kingdom and
significant segments of civil society. Museveni eventually shelved his plans
for Mabira Forest but put the issue back on the political agenda in
August 2011, a few months after winning his fourth term in office and
cementing his two-and-a-half-decade-long hold on power. As had
happened in 2007, a network of civil society groups launched a campaign for
the preservation of Mabira Forest. The campaign gathered momentum
when young Ugandans started using social networking sites like
Facebook and Twitter to organise, among other things, nature walks in the
forest, which, at approximately 50 km from Kampala and 20 km from
Jinja, is easy to reach, even by public transport. In September 2011,
Mahendra Mehta, the head of Mehta Group, was quoted as saying that he
was no longer interested in acquiring part of the Mabira Forest for
sugarcane growing.5 Tensions eased, but the calm again proved deceptive.</p>
        <p>At a party retreat in January 2013, without prior indication,
Museveni announced that he would follow through on his plans for Mabira.
The announcement prompted a swift response from the “Save Mabira
Crusade”, an umbrella group made up of CSOs, local communities,

servation bodies and public-interest lawyers. Beatrice Anywar, an
opposition politician who is perceived as the figurehead of the movement,
went on record saying that the government would not be allowed to
divert attention from the challenges the country was facing, and the fight
for Mabira Forest would continue.6</p>
        <p>
          Ugandan researchers and international observers have interpreted
the massive show of support for the anti-deforestation campaign as a
sign of growing civil society assertiveness in a country with a history of
authoritarian regimes and political repression. Bashir
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">Twesigye (2008</xref>
          : 7)
expressed the view that the Mabira advocacy campaign reflected
increasing environmental awareness and the determination of the Ugandan
people to oppose misguided government policies. In line with liberal
streams of analysis, Keith
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Child (2009</xref>
          : 241) called the SMF campaign a
“powerful demonstration” of how civil society movements with a limited
agenda may transform themselves into platforms that put forward “more
radical demands for democratic accountability”. Similarly, Aili Tripp
(2010: 105) wrote that the response to the cutting down of trees in
Mabira Forest was a showcase of how civil society in sub-Saharan Africa
had woken up to the challenges that threaten human survival, notably
the protection of the environment.
        </p>
        <p>However, the opposition against the Mabira Forest project is no
monolithic bloc. Even though it is widely portrayed as the outcome of
concerted action against pro-business land use policies, the SMF
campaign is composed of a variety of groups whose mandates overlap and
whose interests conflict. The first pillar of the SMF campaign consists of
a cluster of environmental groups, which argue that the conversion of
forest land into a sugarcane plantation will spell environmental disaster
for its adverse effects on biodiversity, fresh water supply, soil fertility and
carbon reduction, harming ecotourism in the process.7 Building on a
growing movement for the preservation of forests in Africa, the late
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai argued that participatory

tree-planting programs in developing countries were an “important
mechanism to support responsible global warming mitigation efforts”
(2009: 257). Moreover, Mabira Forest constitutes an important
catchment area and its partial deforestation will further diminish fresh water
supplies to Lake Kyoga and the Victoria Nile. Lake Victoria, the biggest
water reserve in the Great Lakes region, has already seen a steady decline
in water levels over the years, contributing to a hazardous concentration
of toxic substances, which in turn has jeopardised the survival of the
lake’s fishing industry. Any further deforestation will also adversely affect
biodiversity in Mabira Forest, which, according to a detailed study by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">Davenport and others (1996</xref>
          : 4), is home to 71 restricted-range species of
birds, butterflies and moths. Furthermore, some environmentalists claim
that cutting down one-fourth of the Mabira Forest will translate into a
loss of USD 316 million worth of UN-certified carbon credit.8
        </p>
        <p>
          The SMF campaign has drawn further support from a range of
leftist groups, which oppose international investment in agro-industrial
business in developing countries on economic and ideological grounds.
According to these groups, the idea that business companies adopt
strategies that keep society’s best interests in mind has been discredited in
light of neo-liberal policies that consider community land as a
commodity for sale. Samir
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Amin (2010)</xref>
          , a staunch critic of the Washington
consensus, asserts that subjecting land to the “law of the market” uproots
people and, contrary to the arguments of supporters of privatisation
policies, exacerbates poverty. While the use of forest reserve land for
agro-industrial purposes does not in itself lead to displacement, it
nevertheless forms part of an economic paradigm that comes to its logical
conclusion in what Amin calls the “destruction of the peasant societies”,
which he believes is a major cause of the pauperisation of the Third
World. In a study on the impact that the Mabira project has had on
poverty alleviation,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">Zommers and others (2012</xref>
          : 190-192) conclude that
before expanding sugarcane production into forest reserves, the Ugandan
government will act responsibly only if it carefully evaluates the
importance of ecosystem services to local livelihood, which so far it has
failed to do. More generally, Mabira activists may draw support from
arguments developed by thinkers such as Rob Gray, who argues that
corporations are a force against social justice. The logic behind such
thinking is that corporations are pursuing the goal of maximising wealth
8
for shareholders, who, as they are becoming increasingly wealthy, oppose
the concept of material redistribution, which lies at the heart of social
justice
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Gray 2013: 162-163)</xref>
          . Therefore, for left-leaning anti-poverty
campaigners, Mabira is an open-and-shut case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third plank on which the Mabira protest rests is composed of a
rainbow coalition of watchdog groups that base their criticism on a
variety of concerns, including corruption charges. The Advocates Coalition
for Development and Environment (ACODE), for instance, laments
that the government has failed to invite offers from Mehta’s business
competitors or call for tender.9 The waters are further muddied by the
fact that the land deal with Mehta Group is far from transparent. There
is no information about how the Ugandan exchequer stands to benefit
from the proposed transaction. The media is rife with speculation that
once the land deal is complete, the government will part with its 30 per
cent stake in SCOUL, for a price, leaving in charge Mehta Group, a
business conglomerate that operates in four continents and holds assets
in excess of USD 400 million.10 Unsurprisingly, a recent policy briefing
listed the envisaged sale of forest land in Mabira as one of several
examples of how the ruling coalition in Uganda is being bought off by big
business
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref27">(Kjaer and Katusiimeh 2012: 27)</xref>
          . In terms of social acceptance,
it does not help that SCOUL is the least productive of the three major
sugar producers in Uganda and reportedly incurring substantial losses.
        </p>
        <p>The fourth tributary to the SMF campaign is made up by supporters
of the Kabaka, the king of Buganda, who believes the forest is part of
“Buganda land” and should be preserved in its entirety. It is important to
recall that Museveni’s capture of power in 1986 is largely seen as the
result of his alliance with the Buganda movement, which supported his
armed struggle originating in Central Uganda, where many Baganda live.
Due to disagreements over the question of “federo”, at the core of
which lies the restoration of dignity and autonomy to the kingdom of
Buganda, apart from administration and ownership of land, the relations
between President Museveni and Kabaka Ronald Mutebi II were

author to find anyone willing to comment openly on the nature of the
relationship between the president and the Kabaka of Buganda. In
private conversation, however, observers close to the Buganda movement
suggest that Museveni might be using the Mabira Forest issue to show
the Kabaka his place, which further raises suspicion about the existence
of hidden agendas.

        <p>In sum, the SMF campaign draws its significance both from an
articulation of a rainbow coalition of civil society voices in a public
discourse centred on government action, and from serving as an example of
a social movement that breaks with the tradition of party movements,
from which the current multi-party system in Uganda has developed. A

          The Mabira Forest agitation is one of only a handful of political
campaigns that have been able to attract interest and support from large
segments of the Ugandan public over a period of several years. The
success of the SMF campaign, as well as its shortcomings, will not be easily
understood unless placed in the context of a debate on the state and its
decline in sub-Saharan Africa. After its independence in 1962, Uganda
witnessed short-lived coalition governments, single-party rule, Idi Amin’s
tyranny and a series of wars that ended with the takeover of power by
Museveni and his National Resistance Army in 1986. Some authors have
described the Uganda of the 1990s as a country that, unlike the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, had pulled itself back from the brink of a
“failed state” and managed to break through the logic of violent conflict
to initiate processes of “negotiation and rebuilding”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56 ref7">(Bayart et al. 1999: 5;
Crawford 2004: 47)</xref>
          . Such a reading of Ugandan history tends to
downplay the disastrous consequences of the civil war of the 1980s and the
significant fallout from the subsequent war in northern Uganda that
pitted troops loyal to the government against the Holy Spirits Movement
led by Alice Lakwena and, later, the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA)
under suspected war criminal Joseph Kony. Moses
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">Khisa (2013</xref>
          : 201)
argues that what gave rise to the current conception of the state in Uganda
can be traced to the trauma of prolonged tyranny and civil war that
resulted, first, in a pronounced urge for minimum stability and personal
security among the population at large, and, second, in a strong belief
among the ruling elites that militaristic methods of managing society will
pay off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after taking over power, Museveni was faced with a military
threat to his leadership and a budget crisis exacerbated by increasing
military expenditures. He responded by performing a U-turn from
nonaligned rhetoric and, under pressure from the Bretton Woods
institutions, embraced neoliberal reforms through structural adjustment
programmes. Uganda adopted policies of market liberalisation, privatisation
and deregulation, and started to downsize its civil service and roll back
the state generally. The implementation of such measures required a
political rigidity that contradicted the call for “liberalisation” in any sense
other than economic and flew in the face of civil society’s requests for
democratic consultation and accountability. An authoritarian streak soon
accompanied Uganda’s transition to free-market politics
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41 ref56">(Crawford 2004:
42; Olukoshi 2007: 18)</xref>
          . Museveni’s acceptance of the neoliberal
straightjacket imposed by the Washington Consensus made him a regional “donor
darling” and gave him considerable leeway to consolidate his power at the
expense of competitive politics. This may well have reinforced his
“personalistic politics” and stifled the emergence of a legitimate opposition
strong enough to challenge him in free and fair elections

2006: 30; Mamdani 1994: 557)</xref>
          . The results are plain to see. The 2006
presidential elections were reduced to a contest between Museveni and his
main rival Kizza Besigye. Upon his return to Uganda from exile in 2005,
Besigye had first been held on charges of treason and rape, then, when he
moved to apply for bail, on charges of terrorism
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">(Oloka-Onyango

          . Although Besigye eventually stood in the elections, the impact
of the allegations against him probably doused his chances of winning
before his campaign could take off.

          :

“reluctance to promote and deepen multiparty democracy” in Uganda.
As an example, Makara cited the role of the Electoral Commission,
which he said was widely suspected to be catering to the wishes of the
ruling party. Others echoed such scepticism about the democratic
credentials of the Ugandan polity. Olive
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">Kobusingye (2010</xref>

Uganda was committed to “perpetual electioneering”. While
acknowledging that elections were welcomed with great excitement when the
National Resistance Movement came to power, she argued that the sheen
of elections had worn off over time. In her view, elections can no longer
be considered a means of choosing a leader of the people’s choice.11
Concern over securitisation, de-politicisation and erosion of democratic
procedures is routinely expressed in conversations about the state of affairs in
Uganda.

          Ugandan civil society groups, such as Advocates Coalition for

practice of torture and illegal detention by Uganda’s Rapid Response
Unit. On the 2011 elections, the European Union Election Observation
Mission (2011: 5-7) noted that the electoral process had been “marred by
avoidable administrative and logistical failures”, leading to the
disenfranchisement of an “unacceptable number of Ugandan citizens”.12
Emboldened by the 2011 election results, Museveni started clamping down
on the political opposition with renewed vigour. Tellingly, the massive
police crackdown on the “walk-to-work” campaign, which the political
opposition had organised in Kampala to protest rising living expenses,
coincided with the democratic uprising in a variety of capitals in North
Africa and West Asia.

        <p>
          Before long, the debate had focused on whether Uganda could be
described as a neopatrimonial state, which Paul
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">Williams (2011</xref>
          : 56) has
characterised as hybrid, unstable and shot through with streaks of
authoritarianism. However, the limitations of the neopatrimonial label, a
universal catch-all classification, soon became apparent. State features
differ from region to region, and it cannot be said that every state that is
hybrid is unstable or that every state that is unstable is authoritarian in
nature. Against that background,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">Erdmann and Engel (2007</xref>

loses all meaning. Providing an in-depth analysis of the literature, they
consider the “invasion” of informal politics and personal relations into
the formal structures of legal-rational reasoning as the core element of
the neopatrimonial state. In other words, some features of the
formalbureaucratic Weberian state continue to function, while others are being
eroded and fall prey to competing networks of informal power. Similarly,
Daniel
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Bach (2012</xref>
          : 35, 44) observes that the concept of neopatrimonial
rule has become equated with predatory, anti-developmental and
personalised power, while regulated forms of power have been overlooked or
side-tracked. It makes sense to view the essence of neopatrimonialism not
in the usurping by individuals of power assigned to constitutional organs,
but in the mixing of competing layers of decision-making, formal and
informal, resulting in erratic functioning of state institutions and clashes of
power formations with unpredictable outcomes. The way decisions on the
Mabira Forest have been made and revoked in a haphazard and incoherent
way, without any procedures being followed, fits this definition of
neopatrimonialism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the launch of structural adjustment programmes
devised by Bretton Woods institutions since the 1980s has been
accompanied by talk of the informal state, the predatory state, the shadow state or
even the vampire state. According to
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">Khisa (2013</xref>
          : 212), Uganda presents
an interesting departure from the phenomenon of shadow states that rely
on clandestine economy networks amidst collapsing state institutions.
Khisa argues that the defining feature of the state in Uganda is
donorisation, the result of which is the emergence of a CSO economy fuelled by
Western aid and loans. While the state is stripped of many of its core
functions, CSOs are being given extensive mandates to implement
education, infrastructure, environment protection and health care
programmes. Such analysis ties in with left-leaning criticism of the
dismantling of the state by free market forces. Achille
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">Mbembe (2001</xref>
          : 74-75)
recalls that the “African crisis” of the 1980s originated from the state
placing excessive demands on the economy. Based on the argument that
recovery from such crisis depended on strengthening free market forces,
measures were put in place to restrict state intervention in the economy
without introducing safeguards in key sectors such as health, education
and protection of the environment. Predictably, the results were not all
positive. For example, Uganda’s draconian “anti-homosexuality act”,
which has received strong support from evangelist groups based in the
United States, shows that pro-business strategies in line with policies
formulated by Bretton Woods institutions do not necessarily translate
into a liberal vision for society.13 The changing dynamics in the
interaction of state and civil society actors will be at the centre of the following

          One section of the literature believes that the only way to fix the broken
state, neopatrimonial or otherwise, is to develop strategies to stop the
erosion of state legitimacy, preferably by involving informal CSO
coalitions, watchdog groups and informed citizens. Informed citizens and
watchdog groups formed by such citizens are regarded as an embattled
but important safeguard for democratic institution-building in Uganda, a
corrective to policies devised by authoritarian regimes

cooperation at the regional level, and adopt environmental rules and
regulations governing cross-border relations. From an international

          : 17) compares civil society
movements to a “world party” that places “globality at the heart of political

traditions in every culture and religion”. Beck also feels that
naming-andshaming campaigns by civil society organisations are promising tools to
persuade corporations to comply with international law and corporate
social responsibility schemes.

picture African non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as spaces of
democratic decision-making that will pass rights-based resolutions
advancing “environmental justice, freedom of expression, due process, and
the rule of law”, when in fact many of these NGOs have visions of a just
society diverging radically from those nurtured by actors in northern
countries. Taking a similarly sober position on the capacity or willingness
of CSOs to advance liberal agendas,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Hovil and Okello (2011</xref>
          : 336)
remind us that civil society groups, like state agents, are susceptible to
usurping authority that they cannot legitimately claim and act as
“anticorruption czars”, while replicating the “behaviour of despots”. Considering
CSOs as the last line of defence against state suppression and the
guardian angels of constitutional values – irrespective of their sometimes
contradictory views and ideological aberrations – makes it all the more
difficult to detect where they contradict what they preach and operate on the
same lack of internal democracy, transparency and gender equality as the
state actors they find reason to criticise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mindful of the political economy of civil society activity, another
segment of the literature takes a more critical approach and makes a
point of analysing the organisational capacity of watchdog groups to live
up to their mission statements, measuring rhetoric against performance.
Playing out in variations, these observers argue that CSOs in
semiauthoritarian sub-Saharan African countries may be well-meaning but are
confused about their mandate, alienated from their constituencies, given
to believing in the power of just talking, weakened by infighting and
coopted by either the state or international donors

2010: 30)</xref>
          . Shedding light on the structural constraints of civil society
activism, Miller and others (2013: 136) have noted that CSOs are
permanently trapped between “a desire to enhance community well-being and
an inability to shape the context in which to do so”. Even where a
contentious civil society has emerged – “strong, well networked and capable of
proposal as well as protest” – independent decision-making is constantly
imperilled by a shortage of funds and the need for CSOs to operate in a
national context governed by laws and regulations that have a bearing on
their activities (ibid. 141-143). This seam of research offers explanations
for why civil society movements, particularly in Africa, tend to be
eclectic and short-lived; however, it fails to explain why protests erupt when
they do and why people give their time and money to campaigns when
they have no reassurance that they will receive anything in return.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third strand of analysis, following a neo-realist line of reasoning,
is sceptical of the value of democratic governance and the role of civil
society within it. Michael
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Ignatieff (2005</xref>
          : 69) claims that four decades of
“post-colonial misrule” in sub-Saharan Africa have proven that Africans
themselves do not know what kind of governance works for them. He
adds that the regimes that have made the “best fist of a difficult
situation” have been those in countries such as Uganda, which are “neither
liberal nor democratic but simply have relatively farsighted and honest, if
authoritarian, leadership”. Alex
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">Thomson (2010</xref>
          : 232) describes a
noticeable trend towards chaos and disintegration of existing power structures
as the flipside of civil society ascendancy in the post-colonial African
state. This is the context in which we need to place Dambisa Moyo’s
controversial call for a “decisive benevolent dictator” in aid-dependent
Africa, where leaderships demand nothing from the public at large and
are not required to give anything in return

However, if solutions are sought from centralised decision-making,
rather than the building of consensus around diverse voices, civil society
groups will hardly be considered as significant, or even useful, players in
the larger scheme of things. Buying into this logic, the Ugandan
government maintains that CSOs are not to be trusted because they are funded
by “the West” and also because they are opposition parties in disguise,

      <sec id="sec-2-5">
        <title>Governing the Commons</title>
        <p>As discussed earlier, the Mabira Forest movement does not result from a
single concern shared by all. Rather, it is fed by a wide range of groups
with agendas as complex and multi-layered as Ugandan society itself.
Cutting across debates on development, social justice and environmental
protection, the Mabira Forest case serves as a magnifying glass under
which an array of problems pertaining to resource management come
into focus. Whether the SMF campaign is cited as an example of civil
society resistance to government folly or interference in sound
policymaking depends largely on the criteria used to evaluate the agitation on
its merits. Fischlin and Nandorfy (2012: 89) argue that in devising
regimes governing the commons, individual rights, such as the right to
property, need to be balanced against “community rights”; in other
words, the “rights of community commons to exist and be protected”.
At the heart of such a balancing test lies a re-orientation towards an
understanding of community and rights centring on “interests shaped by
the most basic practices that guarantee sustainable life”, such as food,
water, shelter and respect for difference. The conceptual connection of
resource governance and community-building explains the importance of
addressing the racial overtones of the SMF campaign.</p>
        <p>From its early days, the Save Mabira agitation provided cover for
free-riders who launched attacks on Ugandan Asians on the rationale
that they were to be collectively held responsible for the business
activities of the Indian-owned Mehta group, a transnational corporation that
holds the majority stake in SCOUL. In response to what came to be
known as the “Mabira riots”, Museveni declared that his decision to
allocate part of the Mabira Forest to SCOUL was non-negotiable.
However, the conclusions he drew from the outbreak of violence were
unconvincing. Apart from holding a meeting with the Ugandan Asian
community in Kampala, in which he reassured them of government
protection, Museveni struck a clearly populist chord, blaming the police
for allowing the demonstration that had led to the casualties, announcing
tax breaks for investors and calling for tougher laws on the media.14 The
organisers of the Mabira protests, on the other hand, claimed their
democratic right to assemble freely and peacefully but failed to decisively
distance themselves from the violence against Ugandan Asians and draw
a line between environmental concern and racism.</p>
        <p>
          The repeated outbreak of violence targeting Ugandan Asians
suggests that, under the guise of ecological and social justice concerns, a
band of operators are exploiting popular anxieties and employing
divisive tactics for political gain. Tensions along ethnic lines had built up
gradually under colonial rule and were deliberately exploited by Idi Amin
during his reign of terror from 1971 to 1979. As early as 1972, Amin
launched an expropriation and expulsion campaign against Asian
Ugandans on the grounds that they were “sabotaging Uganda’s economy and
encouraging corruption”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Manby 2009: 54, 96)</xref>
          . Irreconcilable as his
policies were with international human rights standards, it is perhaps
important to note that the anti-Asian resentment and the expropriation
of their assets and businesses was a safe card to play for Amin as it met
with the approval of significant segments of both the Baganda and the
increasingly influential Nubi-Muslim trading communities who saw the
Asian traders as rivals

          In the 1990s, President Museveni started encouraging foreign

Asians to return and repossess their property. The Economist wrote in
1995 that Asians (5,000 lived in Uganda at the time, compared to 70,000
before the expulsion, 23,000 of whom were Ugandan citizens) had not
lost their image as “cut-throat businessmen”, adding that their “influence
in Uganda stretched far beyond their numbers”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">(The Economist 1995)</xref>
          . The
Mehta family, which owns the business conglomerate that carries its
name, had been forced to leave the country in the 1970s and returned
only in the 1990s to reclaim its property. Meanwhile, Museveni’s public
remarks about his personal investment priorities have done little to ease
ethnic tensions. In an interview with the New African, Museveni said that
foreign investors were more useful to the country than some of its
domestic ones because they created jobs, paid taxes, bought raw materials
and paid for the electricity they used.15 Such condescension brings back
images of the colonial times. Ugandans have not forgotten that it was a
hallmark of the colonial state to introduce crops, decide on the colony’s
trading partners and clear forests “without any consideration to
environmental or religious importance”

          Given the country’s record of violence against Ugandan Asians, it is

treated the country as his private preserve, and a tycoon who claimed to
be doing the country a favour while lining his own pockets. Mamdani
maintained that the political opposition had taken advantage of the
situation but had not created the issue, omitting any mention of actors who
might have a vested interest in escalating ethnic tensions in Ugandan
society. Bashir

domination of the country’s economic assets by Indian-controlled
companies, it seems hard to disassociate the consequences of the agitation

as a “symbol of civil society efficacy” that makes it so difficult to
recognise its racial undercurrents. Our analysis of the SMF campaign shows
that while civil society movements address people’s concerns in rhetoric,
they may in fact contribute to discursive practices that are rooted in
prejudice and aimed at divisive politics along ethnic lines. The Save
Mabira agitation has potential as a building block for participatory
democracy only if it owns up to the acts of injustice and the crimes perpetrated
in its name.</p>

          The Mabira Forest issue could move in one of several directions. One
strand of analysis emphasises that, through the results of the 2011
parliamentary elections, a challenge has arisen to Museveni in the form of a
“record number” of parliamentarians belonging to the same party as the
president but being considerably younger than him
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">(Vokes 2012:
311312)</xref>
          . The argument goes that this young generation of politicians thrives
on local support and has challenged the president on a number of
counts, from ministerial appointments and the draft anti-bail bill
(presumably targeting members of the opposition and dissidents) to the
decision to sacrifice part of Mabira Forest for a sugarcane plantation.
The
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">International Crisis Group (2012</xref>
          : 33) considers opposition to the
Mabira project – even from MPs belonging to the National Resistance
Movement, Museveni’s own political party – as one of several promising
signs for the preparedness of parliamentary democracy to assert its
constitutional powers.
        </p>
        <p>Off the record, however, many analysts admit that they are sceptical
about the longevity of the SMF campaign, given its heterogeneity and
lack of vision. They predict that the resistance from a cross-section of
political dissidents and civil society groups will eventually wane, allowing
Museveni and his inner circle to prevail with their plans for Mabira
Forest. It has not been lost on observers that Ugandan government rhetoric
no longer distinguishes between lawful and unlawful dissent on
constitutional grounds, but “loyal and disloyal opposition”, as measured by the
State House, the seat of the president.16 Government interference is

        <p>The distinction between loyal and disloyal opposition was pointed out to the

in the presidential office.
particularly grave in scenarios where CSOs operate in sensitive areas or
pronounce views on large-scale investment projects such as the one
planned for Mabira. In a report on the conditions of NGO work in
Uganda, Human Rights Watch (2012: 27) observes that organisations
carrying out research, advocacy, and citizen education on environmental
issues have faced “increasing obstructions” from the government in the
form of threats of deregistration, accusations of sabotaging government
programmes, and arrest.</p>
        <p>There are also indications that government agencies are being
streamlined on controversial issues. Neither the National Environment
Management Agency nor the National Forestry Authority makes any
reference to the Mabira issue on their respective websites, which is curious
given that both initially positioned themselves against the leasing out of
forest land to SCOUL. It is clear, therefore, that the Ugandan
government has adopted a flexible approach to handling the Mabira Forest
case, yielding to pressure when it became too strong and pushing for the
leasing out of land when it felt that it was in a politically advantageous
position to do so and the campaign had started to come undone.
However, even if Museveni gives up on his plans for Mabira Forest, the
divisive tone used by all stakeholders has introduced a toxic element into the
discourse on development that will take time to diminish.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>This paper has attempted to show that since the SMF campaign was
launched in 2007 in response to plans of the Ugandan government to
hand over one-fourth of the forest to a sugar company for cultivation of
sugarcane, it has drawn strength from a network of loosely connected
civil society groups. Contrary to popular perception, the SMF campaign
does not constitute a continuous and sustained movement. Instead, it
must be understood as a string of activist spells, each provoked by a
perceived need to respond to government initiatives to push the agenda on
Mabira.</p>
        <p>The paper cites evidence indicating that the government’s case in
support of the Mabira Forest project is weak in terms of substance. The
lack of available data on the impact of agro-industrial investment in
Mabira is matched by a lack of risk assessment in the planning phase. In
light of the documentation gap and the resulting margin of error in
assessing the impact of the proposed development project in Mabira
Forest, the case for abandoning the plans of clearing one-fourth of the
forest seems compelling. Even though a solution has remained elusive, the
SMF campaign is a significant achievement, given the fact that President
Museveni has used tremendous political capital to bulldoze an array of
dissenting voices, not on policy grounds, but by way of declaring a
personal “war on sugar”.</p>
        <p>The paper also challenges the uncritical appraisal of civil society
groups in sub-Saharan Africa as democratic checks to neopatrimonial
regimes. Although it is popular strategy among activists to paint political
controversies with a broad brush, the portrayal of land use issues as a
fight between good and evil creates binaries that are easily exploitable for
purposes of identity politics. Irrespective of whether the Mabira Forest
dispute sees business interests or community concerns prevail, the way in
which racial stereotypes were played up in the campaign reveals a
disquieting trend towards fragmentation of Ugandan society. In the final
analysis, the SMF campaign and its ugly underbelly lend credence to claims
for a widening and deepening of civil society engagement, but also to
calls for a critical reflection of what drives activism, within local
communities and across national borders. For civic activism to become an asset
for democratic governance of the commons, however problematic the
term, it will need to focus not only on a campaign agenda but also on a
vision for an inclusive society.</p>
        <p>Zivilgesellschaft und Landnutzungspolitik in Uganda:
Der Konflikt um das Mabira-Naturschutzgebiet
Zusammenfassung: In den vergangenen Jahren hat die ugandische
Regierung wiederholt Schritte zur Abholzung von einem Viertel des
Mabira-Naturschutzgebiets in Zentral-Uganda eingeleitet, um den Boden
einem Agrarunternehmen, das von einem international operierenden
Großkonzern kontrolliert wird, für den Zuckerrohranbau anzubieten.
Immer wenn die Umsetzung des Projekts drohte, organisierten
zivilgesellschaftliche Gruppen breite Protestaktionen, sodass die Regierung ihre
Pläne zurückstellen musste. Die Kampagne zur Rettung des
MabiraWaldes wird häufig als Beispiel dafür angeführt, dass ausdauernder
Protest aus der Zivilgesellschaft als Korrektiv gegen undemokratische
Entscheidungen über Gemein- oder öffentliche Güter wirken und
profitorientierte Akteure, die mit unbedarften oder korrupten Politikern und
Bürokraten Geschäfte ausbrüten, abschrecken kann. Eine tiefer gehende
Analyse der Kampagne offenbart jedoch, dass hier ökologische und
soziale Anliegen mit Partikularinteressen verflochten sind. Der Autor
untersucht das komplexe Interaktionsgeflecht zwischen Staat,
Großunternehmen und Zivilgesellschaft in Uganda, wirft aber auch ein
Schlaglicht auf die vielschichtige und teilweise sehr ambivalente Rolle,
die Nichtregierungsorganisationen in Post-Konflikt-Gesellschaften des
subsaharischen Afrika spielen.</p>
