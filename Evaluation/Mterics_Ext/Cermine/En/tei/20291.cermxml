        <p>The aims of this study were, firstly, to study the association between parents' and teachers' ratings for the Finnish version of the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), secondly, to find out whether the original cut-off scores of the ASSQ identify primary school-aged children with Asperger syndrome (AS) or autism by using the Finnish ASSQ, and thirdly, to evaluate the validity of the ASSQ. Parents and/or teachers of higher-functioning (full-scale intelligence quotient C 50) 8-year-old total population school children (n = 4,408) and 7-12-year-old outpatients with AS/autism (n = 47) completed the Finnish version of the ASSQ. Agreement between informants was slight. In the whole total population, low positive correlation was found between parents' and teachers' ratings, while in the sample of high-scoring children the correlation turned out to be negative. A cut-off of 30 for parents' and teacher's summed score and 22 for teachers' single score is recommended. A valid cut-off for parents' single score could not been estimated. The clinicians are reminded that the ASSQ is a screening instrument, not a diagnosing instrument. The importance of using both parents' and teachers' ratings for screening in clinical settings is underlined.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        According to a study by Howlin and Asgharian [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ], parents
of children with autism were generally aware of
developmental problems by 18 months of age, and parents of
children with Asperger syndrome (AS) at around 30 months
of age, while the average age of confirmed diagnoses was
around 5.5 years in the autism group and 11 years in the AS
group. The diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
thus seemed to be assigned much later than the time when
parents notice developmental deviances in their child. In
order to help to identify ASDs, a number of screening
instruments have been developed, many of them for more
severely handicapped children with autism [e.g. 4, 5, 13] or
for children with ASD at all intelligence levels [e.g. 7, 8,
21]. Additionally, some screening instruments have been
developed and validated precisely for higher-functioning
phenotypes [e.g. 9, 10, 22, 27].
      </p>
      <p>
        The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ)
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] was the first screening instrument developed precisely
for AS. Initially it was known as the Asperger Syndrome
Screening Questionnaire. The rationale for evaluation of the
ASSQ in AS and other ASDs in higher-functioning children
was the fact that there is a clear overlap of symptoms at
behavioural level, reflected in the International
Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (ICD-10, WHO)
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
        ] and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-IV, APA) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ] criteria for ASDs. Originally
designed in Sweden in Swedish, the questionnaire was
developed specifically for teacher screening in children
aged 7–16 years with normal intelligence or mild mental
retardation. However, the Swedish cut-off scores were
determined later for both parents’ and teachers’ ratings
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref9">9, 10</xref>
        ]. The ASSQ has been used in clinical settings in
Finland since the 1990s and it has also been translated into
other languages (English [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ], Lithuanian [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ], Norwegian
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ]). No other validated screening instrument especially
for AS was available when the ASSQ was imported from
Sweden to Finland.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reports on child psychiatric symptoms, agreement
between parents’ and teachers’ ratings is generally low to
moderate [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref14">1, 14</xref>
        ]. Agreement between informants has been
studied not only in general child psychiatric symptoms, but
also in autistic features [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref24">19, 24</xref>
        ]. Szatmari et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
        ]
reported slight agreement between parents’ and teachers’
ratings (r = 0.17) in the Autism Behavior Checklist
(ABC; [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ]) when assessing children with pervasive
developmental disorders (PDD). The results were
suggested to be partly explained by real differences in
behaviour at school and at home. In turn, Posserud et al.
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ] reported low-to-moderate agreement between parents
and teachers when assessing autistic features in a total
population of 7–9-year-old children by using the ASSQ. As
a consequence of low-to-moderate agreement, it is well
grounded to assume that the number of informants—a
multi-informant versus a single-informant approach—may
influence diagnostics [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref18 ref23 ref9">9, 15, 18, 23</xref>
        ]. Because of large
differences across informants, the need to gather
information from both families and schools when screening for
ASDs was also suggested by Posserud et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of our study was threefold: first, to study
the association between parents’ and teachers’ ratings on
the Finnish version of the ASSQ, second, to find out
whether the original cut-off scores recommended by Ehlers
et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] are able to identify Finnish higher-functioning
[full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) C 50] primary
school-aged children with AS or autism and whether using
multi-informant ratings could increase the value of the
ASSQ as a screening instrument, and third, to evaluate the
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),
negative predictive value (NPV), likelihood ratio (LR),
per cent agreement (% agreement) and kappa on the
Finnish ASSQ.

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>
          The participants of this study were drawn from two ongoing
studies concerning higher-functioning (FSIQ C 50)
children with AS or autism: (1) the ‘‘total population study’’
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
          ], consisting of 4,408 children (FSIQ C 50) and (2) the
‘‘outpatient study’’ of high-functioning (FSIQ C 80)
outpatient children with AS/autism, consisting of 34 children.
The participants were then divided into three partly
overlapping groups: (1) ‘‘total population group’’: 4,408
eightyear-old children (mean age 8.3, range 7.8–8.8) from the
‘‘total population study’’ including 13 outpatients with ASD
(FSIQ C 50), (2) ‘‘validation sample’’: 104 eight-year-old
children (mean age 8.3, range 7.8–8.8) from the ‘‘total
population study’’ including the 13 outpatients mentioned
above with ASD (FSIQ C 50) and (3) ‘‘outpatient group’’:
47 outpatient children aged 7–12 (mean age 9.7, range
7.7–12.2) with ASD (FSIQ C 50) from Oulu University
Hospital (n = 43) or at Tahkokangas Service Centre in
Oulu (i.e. a rehabilitation centre for mentally handicapped,
n = 4) including the above-mentioned 13 outpatients with
ASD from the ‘‘total population study’’.
        </p>
        <p>In Finland, compulsory education offers equal
educational possibilities for every child aged 7–16 years. From
the age of 7 to the age of 12, children attend primary
school, and from 13 to 16 years they attend secondary
school. All children undergo developmental examinations
in children’s health care centres several times before school
age. If any developmental deviances are found or mental
retardation is suspected, the child is referred to more
detailed investigations and school readiness examinations
also including the determination of IQ. Parents thus get to
know the cognitive level of their child. If mental
retardation is assigned, the child is referred to prolonged
compulsory education and further service (at Tahkokangas
Service Centre in the Oulu University Hospital area).</p>
        <sec id="sec-2-1-1">
          <title>Registered ASD diagnoses</title>
          <p>Of the 47 ASD outpatients in this study, 32 had the
registered diagnosis of AS, 3 had infantile autism with mild
mental retardation, whereas 11 had ‘‘AS traits’’ and 1 had
‘‘autistic traits’’ with mild mental retardation in the records
of the Oulu University Hospital and/or Tahkokangas
Service Centre. AS and AS traits diagnoses had been assigned
based on the ICD-10 criteria regarding current behaviour.
Thus, a differential diagnosis between AS and
high-functioning autism (HFA) had not been made. The diagnosis
‘‘AS traits’’ refers to the features of AS, and ‘‘autistic
traits’’ to the features of autism.</p>

      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>Procedure</title>
        <p>The studies were approved by the ethical committee of
Oulu University Hospital. The school inspector, the
superintendents of all 43 municipalities and all 329 school
principals were informed and permission was asked to
carry out the screening phase of the ‘‘total population
study’’. Written informed consent was obtained from
parents and from children aged 12–13 years.</p>

          <title>Screening phase of the study</title>
          <p>
            The ‘‘total population study’’ started in September 2000 in
the Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District area [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
            ]
(Fig. 1). All 8-year-old children born in 1992 attending
primary or special school and living in this area in autumn
2000 were chosen for the target population, n = 5,484
(Statistics Finland, 31st of December, 2000). The teachers
of these children were given an information package
concerning the study, including lectures on AS and the ASSQ,
after which the questionnaires were distributed to parents
by teachers. The parents were required to provide a written
informed consent to participate in the study and were asked
to complete the ASSQ and a developmental questionnaire,
in which possible AS and autism diagnosis and possible
mental retardation were asked about. In the case of mental
retardation, the level (mild, moderate, severe or profound)
was also inquired in the developmental questionnaire.
          </p>
          <p>Parent questionnaires were returned to teachers in closed
envelopes with written permission to participate on the
cover. Parents of 4,424 children (80.7%) gave permission.
After permission from parents the teachers of these
children completed the ASSQ. The teachers were also asked
about the child’s curriculum: general or special needs
education (i.e. partly or completely adjusted education or
education for children with mild, moderate, severe or
profound mental retardation, or any other special
education). Finally, the teachers returned all questionnaires to the
researchers. Based on parents’ reports on the level of
mental retardation with complementary curriculum
information from teachers, eight children were excluded as
having moderate or severe mental retardation. A total of
4,416 children remained in the study.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-2-3-2">
          <title>Missing data</title>
          <p>
            Of these 4,416 children, 660 did not have parents’, 26
teachers’ and two did not have either parents’ or teachers’
ratings, and 183 parents’ ASSQs were discarded due to
missing information (i.e. 1–25 items were missing).
Missing items in teachers’ ASSQs were asked either by regular
mail or by telephone, and all teachers’ ASSQs were
thus successfully completed. Eventually, 4,414 children
remained, with 3,571 parents’ and 4,388 teachers’ ASSQs.
‘‘Validation sample’’ for ASSQ validity evaluations
Of the 4,414 children, 125 were included in the ‘‘validation
sample’’ in which the ASSQ validity was evaluated. The
sample of 125 children consisted of all 73
screening-positive (parent ASSQ C 19 and/or teacher ASSQ C 22; [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>

          <p>Three screening-positive outpatients with ASD were
now tested as having an FSIQ below 50, and they were
excluded, leaving 15 outpatients with ASD for further
reevaluations. In the ‘‘validation sample’’, the WISC-III was
administered to three children without any registered ASD
diagnosis to find out the accurate FSIQ level. One
screening-positive child had earlier been diagnosed to have
mild/moderate mental retardation; the FSIQ of that child
was now determined as below 50. Two screening-negative
had severe neurological disability and the previous IQ level
was unsure; these two still could not be tested reliably. All
three children were excluded from the study.</p>
          <p>After diagnostic examinations, school day observations
of five children were undertaken to obtain more
information. The observations were performed by an autism
researcher of our team, a Master of Education (M.K.) blind
to the primary examinations. The observation of each child
lasted an entire school day, including direct observation
during lessons and breaks, ‘‘structured interview’’ (ASSQ)
and non-structured discussion with the teacher. After that,
re-evaluations of 15 outpatients with ASD were performed
by experienced clinicians (S.-L.L. and M.-L.M.) by
reviewing all available data (ADI-R, ADOS tapes, ASSQs,
patient records and school day observations). M.K.
participated in the re-evaluation meetings for the five children
whose school day was observed. The ICD-10 research
criteria were then fulfilled, item by item, based on the
consensus between S.-L.L. and M.-L.M. Two outpatients
with ASD (one AS traits and one AS suspected) did not
meet the ICD-10 research criteria for AS or autism. Finally,
13 were re-assigned as ASD, 5 of them as AS, 6 as HFA,
and 2 as autism with mild mental retardation. Six of the 13
outpatients with re-assigned ASD were registered as ASD

using the ADI-R [

          ] to observe the child’s behaviour and communication
skills. The examinations were administered and videotaped
by a research psychologist (K.J.). The patient records of all
participants were studied. The diagnoses were then
redefined according to the ICD-10 research criteria, based on
information obtained with the ADI-R, ADOS and from
patient records, by a psychologist (K.J.) consulting an
experienced clinician (M.-L.M.) when a second opinion was
needed. Development in the first 3 years of life was now
taken into account. In these evaluations 21 children met the
ICD-10 research criteria for AS and 13 for autism.

        <p>The teachers of all 34 children were asked to complete
the ASSQ 1 year later. Questionnaires were sent by regular
mail to the parents, who were asked to complete the
consent and then give the questionnaire to their child’s teacher.
The questionnaire was resent twice if the ASSQ was not
returned by the teacher. One 12-year-old child did not give
permission to the teacher to complete the ASSQ. Finally,
33 teachers completed the ASSQ with parents’ (and
child’s) permission.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the ‘‘outpatient group’’ consisted of 47
children (13 from the ‘‘total population study’’ and 34 from

functioning children with AS/autism. The medians and
means of the ASSQ scores in parents’ and teachers’ ratings
were significantly higher in children with AS/autism
(‘‘outpatient group’’) than in the total population (‘‘total
population group’’). In addition, parents scored children
who were rated on the ASSQ in our study after receiving
ASD diagnosis at the outpatient clinic significantly higher
than children who were rated on the ASSQ in our study
before receiving ASD diagnosis at the outpatient clinic.</p>
      <p>This might indicate that parents of the children who were
already diagnosed as ASD at the outpatient clinic probably
knew better what kind of features they had to assess,
leading them to rate their children higher, or that they
already knew what was causing their children’s symptoms
and they were more educated to perceive certain symptoms
typical of ASD. Based on this discovery, it may be
assumed that parents might score lower on the ASSQ at
diagnostic examinations in clinical settings, because they
usually do not know very much about ASDs when their
child is referred to the outpatient clinic. After the child has
been diagnosed with ASD parents obtain knowledge about
ASDs, and they might score higher on the ASSQ.
However, the number of subjects (n = 6) who were not
diagnosed as ASD before ASSQ ratings was low. Therefore, the
effect of parents’ awareness of diagnosis on their scoring
should be analysed in larger samples. The teachers’ scores
were at the same level irrespective of whether the
outpatient ASD diagnoses were already given or not. However,
we did not know who of the teachers were aware of the
outpatient ASD diagnosis.</p>
      <p>
        No crucial score difference between genders was found
in the ‘‘outpatient group’’. However, reliable conclusion
about the gender non-differences in higher-functioning
subjects with ASD has to be treated with prudence because
of the wide score ranges and the small number of females
in the ‘‘outpatient group’’ (n = 10). Baron-Cohen et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]
also reported that male and female scores (on the Autism
Spectrum Quotient; AQ) did not differ significantly among
the AS/HFA group; however, the number of females
(n = 13) was also small in their study. In turn, in the ‘‘total
population group’’ males were rated significantly higher
than females by both parents and teachers, which lends
support to the assumption that females are more competent
in their social skills than males [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26 ref6">6, 26</xref>
        ]. There is a clear
overlap of symptoms at the behavioural level between
children with AS and other high-functioning children with
ASD based on the ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria for ASDs.
      </p>
      <p>No significant ASSQ score difference was found between
the children with AS and HFA (Fig. 2), showing that
differential diagnosis between AS and HFA cannot be made
by using the ASSQ.</p>
      <p>
        In Finland, primary school teachers get to know their
pupils and their behaviour well, because there is one main
teacher for each class group who teaches the same pupils for
many hours every day from one to several years. Thus, it can
be assumed that both parents and teachers know the
behaviour of the children quite well, which might have
yielded high concordance in the ratings. However,
agreement between informants was slight (r = 0.207), and even
negative correlation (r = -0.368) was found between
parents’ and teachers’ ratings in the higher scoring ‘‘validation
sample’’. This might indicate that the differences in
behaviour between home and school are real. In addition, the

compare their child with peers. As described, the teachers
were given an information package concerning the study,
including lectures on AS and the ASSQ. By receiving
information, the teachers may have been better aware than
parents as to what kind of features they were supposed to
assess. This might skew the correlation between informants
in the ‘‘total population group’’. In Oulu, the biggest
municipality of this study and the capital of Northern
Ostrobothnia, we were able to obtain the information that
teachers from 14 schools did not took in the lectures on AS
and the ASSQ. However, in spite of the fact that these
teachers were not trained, agreement between informants
was slight (0.097), and in high-scoring ASSQs (parent C 7,
or teacher C 9), correlation was negative (r = -0.421)
between parents’ and teachers’ ratings, being in
concordance with the results of the high-scoring ‘‘validation
sample’’. In contrast, Swedish and Norwegian researchers have
reported a stronger association between parents’ and
teachers’ ratings on the ASSQ. Ehlers et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] reported
marked interrater reliability (Pearson r = 0.66) of the ASSQ
mean total score for parents’ and teachers’ ratings in
children (n = 105) who were consecutively referred to the child
neuropsychiatric clinic, and the correlation across
informants for children with ASD (n = 20) was also marked
(r = 0.77) in their study. In turn, Posserud et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ]
reported a moderate correlation of 0.48 between teacher and
parent score for boys and a low correlation of 0.34 between
informants for girls on the ASSQ in a population sample of
9,430 children. For the whole, scale agreement between
parents and teachers was 0.40 (weighted kappa) in the study
of Posserud et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        The first stage of the ASSQ validation was to find out
whether the original cut-offs are workable in the
‘‘outpatient group’’. Our results showed that only two subjects
with ASD fell below the original parent and teacher
cutoffs (parent ASSQ \ 19, teacher ASSQ \ 22). In addition,
none of the outpatient children with ASD were rated below
both minimum scores with 95% sensitivity based on the
ROC curves in the study of Ehlers et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] (parent
ASSQ \ 7, teacher ASSQ \ 9).
      </p>
      <p>
        After the first stage of the ASSQ validation, we
proceeded to the second phase to evaluate the statistics of
the ASSQ. For this reason, all potential children with ASD
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref12">10, 12</xref>
        ] were selected from the ‘‘total population study’’
to make up a ‘‘validation sample’’ in which the ASSQ
validation was evaluated. Generalizations of the validity
findings might be limited to the clinical settings when
diagnosing higher-functioning patients who are suspected
to have AS or autism. Generalization to whole population
screening has to be treated with caution because the
‘‘validation sample’’ was not selected randomly. We gave
up random selection because of the low number of ASD
diagnoses in total population [e.g. 3, 23].
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on our results, the use of the original Swedish
cutoff of 22 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] with 85% sensitivity and 69% specificity for
teacher ASSQ score is indicated in Finland as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, Ehlers et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] reported poorer sensitivity
(65–70%) and better specificity (91%) for the teacher
cut-off score of 22. However, according to our results the
ASSQ seems to work best by using a summed parents’ and
teacher’s score. In clinical settings, it is important to screen
all potential ASD subjects. Thus, the cut-off score of 30 for
the summed parents’ and teacher’s score is recommended
to be used in clinical settings with 100% sensitivity and
73% specificity. Ehlers et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] estimated the cut-off
score of 19 for parents’ ratings with the sensitivity of
62–82% and the specificity of 90%. Importantly, in Finland
the ASSQ seemed to be invalid in identifying subjects with
AS/autism, if single rating by parents was used: if
sensitivity was high, specificity was low, and vice versa. Thus,
there is a strong caution against the use of single ASSQ
rating by parents when screening higher-functioning
children with suspected AS/autism.
      </p>
      <p>This study showed that the Finnish ASSQ works as a
screening instrument with some limitations. The ASSQ
identifies the majority of higher-functioning children with
AS/autism by using the summed parents’ and teacher’s score
or by using single rating by teacher. NPVs (1.00; 0.97) were
excellent, showing that no children with AS/autism fell
below the cut-offs in summed parents’ and teacher’s ratings
and only few children in single ratings by teacher; i.e. it is
unlikely that a child has AS/autism if rated below the cut-off
scores in summed parents’ and teacher’s or in single
teacher’s rating. However, PPVs (0.35; 0.28) were very low,
indicating that many subjects without a registered AS or
autism diagnosis were rated above the cut-offs in summed
parents’ and teacher’s ratings and in single teacher’s ratings.</p>
      <p>
        In turn, Ehlers et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] did not report any PPV or NPV
values in their study. Our validation findings are preliminary;
research is ongoing and more results are expected later.

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>First, because of the low PPV it is emphasized that the
ASSQ is a screening instrument, not a diagnostic
instrument; all screening-positive children have to undergo
diagnostic examinations.</p>
      <p>Second, this article points out the importance of using
multiple informants, as also suggested by previous studies
concerning ASDs [e.g. 3, 18–20, 24]. Although the cut-off
score could not be estimated for single parent ratings, the
cut-off score for summed parents’ and teacher’s ratings
turned out to be the best.</p>
