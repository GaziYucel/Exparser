Reforms of the public sector have helped create a more efficient and effective public sector,
but also have created a number of problems. Both, the New Public Management and
“governance” reforms have contributed to the contemporary problems in governing. These
problems have been political to a great extent, reflecting the tendency to emphasize
administrative rather than democratic values. Governments have begun to react to the real
and perceived problems within the public sector by developing a number of
“metagovernance” instruments that can help steer public organizations but which involve less
direct command and control. This paper addresses the contemporary governance tasks of
restoring political direction and policy coherence while at the same supporting the autonomy
of public organizations, and the involvement of policy networks, in governing.
Zusammenfassung
Die in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten durchgeführten Reformen des öffentlichen Sektors
haben zu mehr Effizienz und Effektivität geführt, aber auch eine Reihe von Problemen mit
sich gebracht. Der Einzug von Ideen des New Public Management und des
„Governance“Ansatzes hat zu den Problemen des Regierens, wie wir sie heute beobachten können,
beigetragen. Diese Probleme sind vor allem politischer Natur, da die Reformen zu einer
Überbetonung administrativer gegenüber demokratischen Werten geführt haben. Auf die
realen und die wahrgenommenen Probleme haben die Regierungen mit einer Reihe von
„Meta-Governance-Instrumenten“ reagiert, die zur Steuerung öffentlicher Verwaltungen
beitragen können, aber weniger direkte hierarchische Kontrolle voraussetzen. Dieser Beitrag
diskutiert Möglichkeiten, wie die politische Kontrolle über den öffentlichen Sektor und die
Kohärenz staatlicher Programme wieder hergestellt und gleichzeitig die Autonomie
öffentlicher Organisationen sowie die Einbindung von Policy-Netzwerken gestärkt werden
können.

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p>The public sector in most of our countries has undergone significant change during the past
several decades. Whether the changes have been described as “reform”, “modernization”,
“reinvention”, or whatever, most governments now are vastly different from what they were
even a few years ago. These changes have, in general, produced governments that are
more efficient and effective. Further, although most of the reforms implemented have been
conceived largely within the market model (Peters, 2001) public administration is now also
more open to public participation in many countries, and also has been opened to greater
participation by lower echelon public employees.</p>
        <p>
          The dominant pattern of reform of the public sector over the past several decades has been
discussed as the “New Public Management”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Hood, 1991; Christensen and Laegreid, 2001)</xref>
          ,
or simply NPM. The basic idea of NPM has been that government should be made to be
more efficient and effective, and that the best way of achieving these goals is to make the
public sector perform more like the private sector. One component of these reforms has
been to enhance the autonomy of managers and their organizations, with the assumption
that if managerial talent were unfettered by internal rules then the public sector would be
more efficient
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(DiIulio, 1994)</xref>
          . In addition, this autonomy was to be enhanced by creating
numerous autonomous organizations (see Niskanen, 1971) such as the “Next Steps
Agencies” in the United Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the participatory dimension of change may have been discussed sotto voce in
many reform processes, it has become a more central conception of reform. In particular,
while many of the initial stages of reform were discussed as the New Public Management,1
the increased interest in “governance” styles of reform has enhanced the participatory
dimension of change (Peters, 2005). Like the idea of the New Public Management
“governance” as a concept can be extremely vague
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref4">(see Pierre and Peters, 2000)</xref>
          , and has
been the subject of significant academic contestation. That having been said, most of the
“governance-style reforms” implemented by governments have emphasized the role of social
actors in making and implementing policy, and especially emphasized the role of networks
and analogous structures in the processes of governing societies.
        </p>
        <p>While both the New Public Management and governance styles of reform have made
significant contributions to the performance of the public sector, they have also created a
number of significant problems within government. In particular, both styles of reform have
tended to create problems of incoherence and poor coordination in the public sector (see
1 This term was, and is, extremely broad and to some extent included participatory ideas as well as the market
based efficiency concepts. See Hood (1991).
Bakvis and Juillet, 2004) and, in addition, those reforms have created extensive
accountability problems (Mulgan, 2000). Therefore, like almost every other reform initiative
before them, both NPM and governance reforms have engendered a host of new reforms,
and the process of attempting to “make government work better and cost less” continues
unabated.2 Very much like Herbert Simon famously argued approximately 60 years ago,
most of the adages used in public management (and indeed private management) have
opposites that are in the right circumstances equally valid.</p>
        <p>Given the above discussion, we are dealing with several alternative futures for the public
sector in most industrialized democracies. Both of these futures will involve change, and
both will require continuing investment of political capital in order to be effective. Further, the
central feature of these two futures is that one need not make a definitive choice between
them. Both are feasible, and their effects will be complementary. The central political
question is not so much one of making a choice between the two, but rather finding a way of
making the two fit together in an effective, and democratic, manner.</p>

        <title>1. One Future – Continuing the Current Patterns of Reform</title>
        <p>
          Although I have been discussing them as alternative models of the public sector, as indeed
they are, the patterns of reform that have shaped contemporary government have a number
of things in common. Phrased in the most general manner, these reforms have tended to
move the process of governing out of the center of government. These reforms have
involved a number of different changes in patterns of governing, including:
1) Deconcentration. One of the most important changes associated with the New
Public Management has been creating a number of new autonomous or
quasiautonomous organizations – often referred to as agencies
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref18 ref22 ref3 ref8">(Pollitt and Talbot, 2004;
Verhoest, Rubecksen and Humphreys, 2007)</xref>
          . A good deal of policymaking and
implementation in contemporary political systems has been delegated to these
organizations, under the assumption that single-purpose organizations with
managerial autonomy will allow skilled public managers to improve the quality of
public services. This deconcentration also represents some denigration of politics
and politicians in the process of governance.
2) Decentralization. As well as moving some of the functions of the public sector
out to devolved organizations within central government, another strategy has
been to decentralize activities and give greater responsibility to sub-national
2 This phrase was, of course, the sub-title of the National Performance Review (Gore Commission) in the United
States but came to represent a general ambition for reformers in the public sector.
        </p>
        <p>I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 3
governments. The logic of decentralization is in part to improve efficiency, given an
assumption that smaller units will provide services better. Also, decentralization can
be justified on democratic grounds, with the public having perhaps greater
opportunity for involvement at lower levels of governing.
3) Delegation. A final strategy for reforming the State has been to delegate public
authority to a variety of other actors (for general models see Huber and Shipan,
2002). In the market approach to governing much of that delegation has been to
contractors and to other market actors. In the governance model much of the
delegation would be to networks and to not-for-profit organizations. Both types of
delegation can be thought to improve the efficiency of the public sector, and the
use of networks of social actors also generally is argued to be important for
enhancing the democratic element of governing.</p>
        <p>
          We might be able to add to this list of descriptions of change, but taken together all
the reforms mentioned here involve “decentering” the governing process
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref15 ref18">(see also
Peters, 2004)</xref>
          . Although obviously different in terms of their details, and in terms of
their justifications, the impact of all of the changes in the public sector has been to
minimize control from the center of government – presidents, prime ministers and
even individual ministers.3 Thus, they all have at their heart an assumption (explicit
or implicit) that government will work better if the political center is devalued, and if
public administrators and private sector actors are more responsible for delivering
services.

        <title>2. From Reform to New Problems Created by Reform</title>
        <p>
          The above changes in the public are often justified by the familiar “steering not rowing” logic
(Osborne and Gaebler, 1991), assuming that governments are better at setting directions for
policy than they are at actually delivering those policies. In reality, however, these reforms
may also have reduced the steering capacity of the public sector, and in particular have
reduced the capacity that political officials have enjoyed in the past for exercising control
over the policies of their governments. This reduction of the “primacy of politics”,4 has in turn
created several governance problems:
3 This argument appears to be in direct contradiction to that usually found in comparative politics that emphasizes
the decline of parliamentary and even cabinet government in favor of prime ministerial domination – often incorrectly
called the presidentialization of parliamentary regimes
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(see Von Mettenheim, 1997; Heffernan, 2003)</xref>
          . That
argument, however, focuses more on the political control of the process within government and changes in media
focus rather than on the actual capacity of political executives to control policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          4 This term has come to be commonly used. For one of the earlier uses see Pollock (1951).
1) Politics and Steering. As already implied, the emphasis on moving activities
away from the center of government has reduced the capacity of elected officials to
exercise control over these policies, even though in democratic politics we assume
that elections are about choosing policy
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref6">(see Rose, 1974; Caplan, 2007)</xref>
          . To the
extent that so much of government activity is delegated then political leaders are
left with few levers, and often poor quality levers, with which to affect the course of
their own governments. Any number of prime ministers have expressed their
feelings of impotence in the context of contemporary patterns of governing, but
many fewer have actually done anything about attempting to redress that balance
(but see below).
2) Coordination. A second difficulty resulting from the decentering of the public
sector has been reduced levels of coordination among policies and organizations.
The notion of first splitting up large organizations into a number of small
organizations, and then giving organizations greater autonomy has been central to
reforming, especially the creation of agencies. The numerous organizations
operating with increased autonomy has, however, tended to exacerbate the familiar
problems of coordination and coherence in the public sector. The proliferation of
organizations, in turn, also contributes to the difficulties in exercising political
control.
3) Complexity. The larger number of organizations involved in governing, and the
multiple ways in which they are linked to the more conventional parts of the public
sector, also increase the complexity of governing. While complexity is not per se
detrimental, it may counteract some of the efficiency gains generated through
management changes. That is, the increased number of veto points in the system,
and the difficulty in gaining acceptance at all those points does reduce chances of
success. Further, complexity does tend to reduce the transparency of the public
system and therefore affects accountability (see below).
4) Capture. By separating public organizations from direct connections to political
authority, the decentering reforms tend to make those organizations more
vulnerable to capture by other interests. This is a classic problem in the analysis of
independent regulatory agencies in the United States and elsewhere, but the logic
can be extended to cover a range of other organizations that have been detached
from political support. The capture may be by local geographical interests
(Whitford, 2002) or by functional interests, but the idea of depoliticizing government
tends to lead to other forms of politicization, often of a less desirable sort.
5) Accountability. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the reforms in the public
sector have generated major accountability problems. One virtue of the “primacy of
politics” is that it identifies clearly a hierarchy of accountability in the public sector,
        </p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 5</title>
      <p>and also identifies a number of mechanisms for enforcing that accountability. When
there are a number of alternative relationships between elected politicians and
service provision, and many of the service providers assume that they are meant to
act autonomously, then identifying responsibility for actions is difficult.</p>
      <p>
        Thus, both from the perspective of democratic theory and from the perspective of policy
capacity the reforms associated with the New Public Management approach, as well as
those coming from the governance approach, have generated a substantial need for further
change. As I will point out below, these changes can not be a simple return to the status quo
ante with public sector dominance, although some scholars are arguing for a return to more
traditional forms of public management (Olsen, forthcoming). Too much change has occurred
and governments have learned too much about alternative mechanisms for delivering
services to be able to make a simple return to the bureaucratized, hierarchical model of
governing (see Walsh and Stewart, 1992). In part, the changes in the public sector
associated with these two reform movements have created substantial improvement in the
functioning of the public sector, at least at the more micro-levels.5
That having been said, however, the movement away from that style of governing has to
some extent been exaggerated, and much of the old system remained in place, if subsumed
under the facade of new forms of governing
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Schofield, 2001)</xref>
        . Further, some scholars are
also discussing the return to a Weberian style of governing in many settings, with a
perceived need to reinvigorate some of the mechanisms for control and probity that were
components of more traditional forms of governing. This is far from just being reactionary, but
represents the need to recreate some values that were central to making governments both
effective and accountable, and which have not been replaced adequately by the products of
reform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving aside the return to a more Weberian style of governing, most of the problems
generated by the NPM and “governance” reforms can be encapsulated in the problem of
democratic government. Again, if elections are about selecting policy as well as leaders, and
if those leaders once elected find that they have less influence over policy than they, and
probably their voters, believe is appropriate, then there is a fundamental democratic
problem. Even if the elected leaders are able to do some of their steering without the rowing,
their level of policy control may not be as great as desired. This loss of control over policies
is evident for making policy choices, but is even more apparent given the crucial role that
implementation plays in determining the true meaning of policy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref18 ref22 ref3">(Meyers and Vorsanger,
2004)</xref>
        .
5 By that I mean that the closer one gets to the actual delivery of services, and especially to the operations of
individual organizations, the greater have been the benefits of reform. When more systemic factors in governing are
considered, the benefits of the reforms may be negligible and the costs may have outweighed the benefits.
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>3. The Center Strikes Back</title>
        <p>
          Having recognized their own difficulties in exercising control over the public sector, a number
of governments have begun to take action to attempt to restore control over the public
sector. In some instances this shift in ideas about governing has reflected particular political
circumstances, including changes in the political parties controlling the public sector. In other
cases the attempt to reimpose greater political control has reflected more fundamental
changes in ideas about governing. These changes reacting to the problems created by NPM
et al. have not had the generality of either NPM or governance ideas, but they do reflect the
perceived need to recapture some of the political steering that has been lost.
Some of the attempts to reimpose control over governing have tended to run counter to
many of the canons of “good governance”. In particular, when faced with the number of
organizations and programs over which they perceive themselves to have little direct control,
political leaders have tended to politicize the management of those programs. A number of
studies of the public sector in the industrialized democracies
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref14 ref15 ref18 ref22 ref3">(Peters and Pierre, 2004)</xref>
          have
shown that political leaders have found themselves in the position of having to take political
responsibility for programs that they have little capacity to influence directly, and that this is
an extremely uncomfortable position for those leaders. One of the simplest means of
attempting to gain such control is to have one’s own people managing the programs, e.g. to
move toward higher levels of political appointment. Somewhat paradoxically, the internal
deregulation of public employment fostered by NPM has facilitated those appointments.6
In addition to politicization, the decentering of the State has tended to engender the
identification of scapegoats and denial of responsibility. As noted, political leaders may
believe that they are being held responsible without justification, and in turn attempt to shed
that responsibility. To some extent the complaint is justified, given that many of the linkages
associated with effective responsibility and accountability have been weakened, and many of
the levers for control have been eliminated. In fact, even some of the mechanisms being
used in an apparent attempt to create responsibility for service provision may, in the end,
dilute that responsibility. For example, the increasing use of “czars” for problem areas of
public service tend to deflect attention, and potentially accountability, away from the political
leaders and in the direction of the “czar”.7
6 It is quite possible that these appointments are perfectly qualified as managers, but it is very clear that there are
more political forms of appointment, and that those appointments give the appearance of politicizing the public
sector in ways that in many politic systems are unacceptable.
7 The Blair government in the United Kingdom was the most enthusiastic user of czars, for problems such as the
railways, several aspects of the National Health Service, and for children’s services, among others. This mechanism
enables the Prime Minister or a minister to argue that something has been done, and thereby to (attempt to) escape
personal political accountability.

      <title>I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 7</title>
      <p>
        Not all of the reactions to the perceived loss of political control have been as negative as
those already discussed. Perhaps most obviously, a number of governments have been
attempting to build mechanisms for coordinating the numerous programs and autonomous
organizations that have been created. One of the more obvious of these attempts has been
the movement of “joined up government” in the United Kingdom, but there have been
analogous programs in a number of other countries
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref8">(Pollitt, 2005; Christensen and Laegreid,
2007; Gregory, 2004)</xref>
        . The basic idea has been to attempt to integrate government after it
had been disaggregated by previous regimes. In some cases, the attempt was structural, but
in others there was a more intellectual thrust of attempting to create more “holistic”
government that could provide a relatively seamless web of services
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref18 ref22 ref3">(6, Leat, Setzler and
Stoker, 2004)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>To some extent the notion of joining up government, while certainly a valuable contribution to
governing, missed some of the crucial elements of the decentering reforms. The attempts to
improve coordination were indeed joined up government, and apparently were less
interested in joining up the other non-governmental aspects of governing that had become
so important. In fairness, attempting to produce integration at that level would be more
difficult, and might even be counterproductive, if viewed from rather conventional
perspectives of governing. That is, simply attempting to bring the various relationships with
social actors into a single format, and/or to reduce autonomy, may eliminate the gains from
the previous reforms without necessarily creating commensurate benefits.
4. The Gap
The discussion to this point reveals the presence of two distinct formats for contemporary
governance. As already noted, these two styles, while distinct, are also to a great extent
complementary. One governance style emphasizes the need to improve the quality of
service delivery, the management of individual organizations, and the democratization of
those services. The reforms associated with both NPM and with “governance” have been
successful in a number of cases, but then created the need for the second pattern of
change, one that emphasizes the need to coordinate, create greater coherence, and to
restore the primacy of politics. Each of these approaches to governing constitutes an
important contribution to the capacity to provide better governing, but they are rather
different. The major task in governing, therefore, may become to “knit” together the two
alternatives.</p>
      <p>
        In addition to the practical issues of governing involved, these two approaches to governing
represent interesting theoretical concerns. On the one hand, there have been important
theoretical developments in the area of “governance”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Sørenson and Torfing, 2000; Klijn and
Koopenjan, 2005)</xref>
        . As implied above this term has come to mean a number of different
things, but perhaps the dominant strand has emphasized the need to consider the process of
providing direction to society, and providing public services, as involving actors well beyond
those nominally in the public sector. Thus, the “governance” reforms mentioned above
address the involvement of a wide range of actors in making and delivering services, and
that involvement is reflected a justified in a growing body of social scientific literature.
One could argue that the concern with governance is old wine in new bottles given that,
especially in Northern European countries, varieties of corporatism and corporate pluralism
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Rokkan, 1967)</xref>
        have been in existence for decades, if not centuries. The reality of the
involvement of social actors with the public sector has to some extent changed as networks
have strengthened. Further, the theory surrounding that involvement of private sector actors
has certainly changed. For example, rather than much of the involvement being motivated by
the State itself (even in the corporate pluralist model), contemporary modes of “governance”
allow for greater autonomy exercised by the social actors, and more autonomous
selforganization of the networks that are to provide governance.8
While governance theory, and its development of the logic of networks, has made a number
of contributions to our understanding of the processes of steering the economy and society,
it also has a number of internal problems. One of the most important of these problems has
been the assumption of decision-making capacity of networks. The network model appears
well-suited for conditions in which the principal actors agree on goals and on means, but
paradoxically if there were that level of agreement then there might be no need for the
networks in the first instance.9 While the networks are advanced as alternatives to
conventional forms of governing, they lack pre-determined decision-rules that both enable
decisions to be made in the most difficult of circumstances, and also legitimate those
decisions.10
In addition to the problem in making decisions at all, the absence of clear decision rules may
lead to the decisions being sub-optimal. Much as Fritz
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">Scharpf (1988)</xref>
        argued about
decision-making in multi-level governance systems, the need to reach consensus may lead
to decisions by the lowest common denominator. If there are multiple constituencies with
8 That having been said, some scholars of governance do note the extent to which the State is crucial for
establishing the framework under which the involvement of those actors are granted powers to make and implement
policy. Likewise, networks might have little raison d’etre were State authority, even if delegated, available for the
implementation of the decisions made. These factors are crucial for the meta-governance arguments presented
below.
9 The most obvious case would be epistemic communities in which there is an agreement based on a common
professional or scientific body of knowledge
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(see Adler, 1992)</xref>
        .
10 Majority rule in legislatures, for example, permits decisions to be made even in the face of conflict, while the more
consensual logic of networks may render such decision-making difficult. Further, as these constitutional decision
rules are known in advance, they tend to legitimate those decisions, at least in the procedural sense of the term
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Buchanan and Tullock, 1962)</xref>
        .

      <p>
        potentially extremely different ideas about policy then the only way to resolve the conflicts
may be to find the few points of agreement. The more or less incremental outcomes from
that type of decision-making process may please established interests within the networks,
but may add little to the capacity for innovation and for major policy change
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(but see Dente,
Bobbio and Spada, 2003)</xref>
        . That having been said, assuming that such incremental decisions
could be made, implementation would be facilitated because the potential opposition to
change would be coopted into the decision.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, and most importantly perhaps, the delegation of substantial amounts of authority has
led to major problems of democracy. These democratic problems involve not only
accountability but also representation – both fundamental democratic values. This is, of
course, rather paradoxical given that one of the principal justifications for at least some
aspects of delegation has been to enhance public involvement. Despite those good
intentions only members of certain groups may be involved in the networks, and especially
“potential groups” with low levels of organization may not be represented adequately.
These challenges to governance theory mirror very closely the problems faced by
governments in the “real world” discussed above. Delegation to networks, contractors,
subnational governments, or whatever other actor may be used to make and implement policy
creates agency problems, so that the political principals can not produce effective control
(Huber and Shipan, 2002). Whether the problem is phrased in terms of principals and
agents, or in terms of more overtly political control issues, critics of governance have
questioned the capacity of these models to explain adequately the actual selection and
delivery of services, especially when considered in a democratic framework.</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>5. Bridging the Gap: Meta-Governance</title>
        <p>The theoretical development in governance has now extended to the idea of
“metagovernance”, meaning in essence the governance of governance (see O’Toole, 2007). The
weaknesses of governance as an encompassing concept for describing what occurs within
in the contemporary processes of governing have become more apparent, even to some
advocates of the approach. This awareness has generated the need to think about the
means of building into governing processes increased control, while at the same time
permitting some autonomy for the networks and other forms of decentered governing. Any
reasonable conceptualization of contemporary governance processes must contain a great
deal of decentered activity, and recognize that it is impossible to return to the status quo
ante. At the same time, however, that conceptualization must also recognize that all of the
requisite functions of governing a society can not be fulfilled by those decentered
processes.11
Developing a working conception of meta-governance therefore helps to bridge the gap
between the disaggregated processes within the contemporary public sector and the desire
of many political principals to restore some direct control. In the bluntest terms then
metagovernance would simply be reneging on the delegations of power and recenteralizing
controls in the structures associated with the “conventional” public sector. As already argued,
such a simplistic response is unlikely to be successful, and may not be politically viable.12
The reforms of the past several decades are not unpopular with many people in and out of
government, and have created their own constituencies. Further, the ideology of New Public
Management continues to be widely accepted and those ideas continue to motivate policy
choices concerning internal management. The discourse surrounding public management
has been altered in a fundamental manner so that any simplistic atavistic response is
unlikely to be acceptable.</p>
        <p>As well as thinking about meta-governance as a simple reaction to changes in the public
sector, and an attempt to recreate the past, it must also be understood as creating the
conditions under which governance models can perform effectively. For example, much of
the governance literature assumes that networks are self-organizing and autonomous, but in
many cases they must be created and fostered, often by the State. Likewise, in order to be
effective, a network must have a point of access in the public sector that legitimates and
motivates the involvement of the members, with public bureaucracies providing most of
those points of access. In addition, the actions of any policy network may have to be
legitimated and the formal institutions of the public sector themselves may be crucial for that
legitimation. In short, no matter how substantial the internal capacity of the network may be,
it may not be effective without the active involvement of government.</p>

        <title>6. The Instruments of Meta-Governance</title>
        <p>Governments have at their disposal much of the same toolbox for meta-governance that they
have for coping with other policy problems, but those tools are available in somewhat
different mixtures. The mixture has changed in part because of the specific tasks involved in
11 Yes, this is a functionalist approach to politics and government. Although often denigrated functionalist
approaches do have the capacity to identify important issues and also to identify the possible solutions to those
problems. In particular, in this instance knowing what must be done to govern helps to understand why the
decentered formats may be inadequate.
12 The politics involved here are more likely institutional politics, defending the prerogatives of some organization or
program or another, rather than partisan politics. Those institutional interests may, of course, be connected to the
social interests being served by the organizations involved.</p>
        <p>

meta-governance as opposed to those of attempting to influence society. Importantly,
metagovernance involves attempting to shape behaviors of organizations that have some political
legitimacy of their own so that some of the usual authoritative relationship may not be as
viable. The mixture of tools is now also different for meta-governance because there has
been some general move toward “New Governance”
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Salamon, 2001)</xref>
          , implying using
negotiation, bargaining and broader ranges of compliance than in conventional command
and control styles of intervention. Given the general differences in meta-governance from
governance, it is necessary to consider some range of alternatives, or complements, to
those conventional mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priority Setting. Perhaps the fundamental strategy for meta-governance is establishing
priorities, and establishing them politically. A fundamental weakness in the network and other
decentered forms of governing is that all programs and goals are virtually equal. This
equality is largely a function of delegating authority to organizations, all of whom presume
that their programs are at least as valuable as everyone else’s program. Likewise, even if the
decentered aspects of government are autonomous and quasi-autonomous organizations
they still assume that they have been granted that autonomy in order to pursue their own
goals, rather than any more comprehensive goals for the “Whole of Government”.13
Priority setting can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Most involve enhancing the
capacity of presidents, prime ministers and their central agencies. This need to strengthen
the center may appear somewhat ironic, given the tendency of parliamentary regimes to
discuss the “presidentialization” of politics, but the focus on the chief executive is often more
a media event than a reflection of the capacity for governance
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref17">(Peters, 2007)</xref>
          . There are
some real attempts to strengthen the center and establish priorities. For example, the
Finnish government now creates several cross-cutting programs as components of the
coalition documents for each new government
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Bouckaert, Ormond and Peters, 2000)</xref>
          . Other
governments have attempted to restore some capacity to govern from the center
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(Savoie,
2004)</xref>
          , but the capacity to govern from the center still appears weaker than might be
expected.
        </p>
        <p>Soft Law. If conventional uses of authority are not appropriate for the tasks of
metagovernance then some “softer” alternatives may be the necessary response. The shift to soft
law has been evident not just for meta-governance but like other elements of new
governance has been applied to a range of situations (Morth, 2003). The basic notion of this
approach to governing has been to use instruments such as benchmarks, guidelines,
frameworks, and a host of other mechanisms that establish ranges of compliance rather than
13 This term has been used by the Australian government and several other national governments to indicate the
importance of creating more comprehensive approaches to governing. Even in those cases, however, the links to
private sector organizations, and even sub-national governments, delivering public services often are not
adequately institutionalized.
specific points of compliance. Further, these instruments tend to be the products of
discussions and negotiations rather than imposition from above.</p>
        <p>The nature of soft law is to establish ranges of compliance and provide direction rather than
command action. This response to the meta-governance problem reflects the need to steer
but continue to do so at a distance, allowing a range of responses from networks, or local
governments. The “softness” of the law may vary depending upon the object of the steering.
For example, attempting to control sub-national governments that have some political base
of their own may be more challenging than attempting to control the private members of a
network. Further, the capacity to use soft law effectively may vary across policy areas, with
those involving more directly the formal powers of the State being less amenable to informal
styles of steering and governance.14</p>

        <title>7. Maintaining the Golden Thread</title>
        <p>Strategies of decentering government and loosening control involve minimizing direct
controls over organizations and networks. For actors at the center, however, reducing levels
of control may not mean totally abandoning it, and some means of control may still be
maintained while simultaneously permitting autonomy in other areas of activity. Indeed, one
of the more interesting aspects of the contemporary discussions about autonomy and control
within the public sector is the dance being danced by central control structures and
agencies, quangos and sub-national governments to whom substantial autonomy has been
granted, at least in theory (see Yesilkagit, 2007).</p>
        <p>
          Analytically, we
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref17 ref8">(Bouckaert, Peters and Verhoest, 2007)</xref>
          have elsewhere discussed the
autonomy of public organizations as involving three substantive dimensions – financial,
human resources and policy. Thus, an organization may be given the latitude to make its
own decisions about personnel and about spending, but the center may retain control over
the policy choices of the organization. The available evidence, albeit generally not expressed
in terms of meta-governance, is that central governments tend to maintain the financial purse
strings and use those to ensure adequate compliance along other dimensions of activity
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref18 ref22 ref3">(Wanna, Jensen and De Vries, 2004)</xref>
          . As well as varying substantively, the maintenance of
controls from the center may also be strategic or operational. That is, the control
organizations may attempt to either control the frame of action of the (presumably)
autonomous organizations or they may attempt more direct management of the day-to-day
decisions made by the organizations. The former may more clearly approximate the logic of
14 For example, see the discussion of informal governance mechanisms by

      <p>“steering at a distance”, but both represent some diminution of the real autonomy of the
organizations.</p>
      <p>The point of this discussion is that autonomy and control may not be as incompatible in
practice as they may appear conceptually. The logic of meta-governance, and the “knitting”
to which I alluded above, is that both these concepts must co-exist, and are beginning to
coexist more effectively, within contemporary political systems. As argued concerning the
utilization of soft law as an instrument for meta-governance, the actual mixture of autonomy
and control is likely to be contingent, and may also be dependent upon the particular political
system. The task for both the academic analyst and the practitioner is to identify mixtures
that can at once deliver effective political (democratic) control and maintain the efficiency
gains that appear to have resulted from many of the NPM reforms. To square this circle
maintaining one or a few primary controls, usually the budget, may be an effective strategy
for meta-governance.</p>
      <sec id="sec-6-1">
        <title>8. Performance Management</title>
        <p>
          Finally, the increasing use of performance management in almost all developed
democracies, and many other systems, provides a means of controlling potentially
autonomous organizations
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref17">(see OECD, 2007; Peters, 2007)</xref>
          . Although the term may be used
in a variety of ways, the fundamental idea is that by using measurable targets for the results
of public programs central control organizations can monitor and control the behavior of
those organizations. This technique therefore shifts the mantra of New Public Management
from “let the managers manage” to “make the managers manage”, meaning that some of the
latitude inherent in the management ideas of NPM has been lost in favor of mandates to
managers.
        </p>
        <p>Performance management has some attributes in common with soft law as an instrument for
meta-governance. In particular, this method relies on negotiating frameworks and contracts
to impose control over the organizations delivering services, as well as the individuals
involved in those programs. The targets that are established in performance management
tend to be flexible, or tend to be progressive, so that the steering is rather “soft”, and permit
the organizations involved to have some latitude in how they reach the performance targets.
In addition, levels of compliance tend to be progressive so that the levels at which any
organization must perform tend to be negotiated year after year, with some continuing ability
to affect the outcomes of performance management.</p>
        <p>Performance management can help to solve several of the problems created by earlier
reforms of the public sector. For example, when performance measurement and
management are used internally between ministries and their components (including
perhaps contractors as well as formal institutions within the public sector) they are important
elements of internal management and steering. However, when applied more directly by
external organizations – parliaments, auditors, central agencies – then performance
management can be a very useful component for accountability. Especially when the
performance standards are made public these indicators are important for accountability as
well as for establishing general democratic frameworks for action.</p>

      <sec id="sec-6-2">
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>Governance has been and continues to be a scarce commodity in most countries. In many
ways the capacity to govern has been enhanced significantly over the past several decades
through the spread of the ideas of both New Public Management and the ideas of
governance. These approaches to governing both tended to enhance the autonomy of lower
level components of the governing system, whether sub-national governments, agencies, or
networks linking public and private actors. The capacity of organizations to make more of
their own choices, and the capacity to employ management techniques not familiar to the
public sector, have tended to make government more efficient and effective in service
delivery.</p>
        <p>Despite the successes of many aspects of reform in the public sector, the problems of
accountability and control that were inherent in these reforms have engendered a
subsequent round of change. Although it is impossible to return to the governance models
that were the object of the NPM and “governance” reforms, some mechanisms for
addressing the accountability and other fundamental democratic issues raised by the first
round of reforms are required. The perceived negative consequences of reforms have
produced some new types of governing, discussed here as “meta-governance”.
The primary governance task, as outlined in this paper, therefore is to knit together these two
strands of change in the public sector. While the one strand represents the efficiency drives
of governing, the other tends to represent better the political, and especially democratic,
aspirations for governing. The fundamental point here is that these two can be knit together
effectively, but that the knitting will depend upon a number of contingent factors. The first
rounds of reform (and especially NPM) tended to assume that one size fit all, but the ability
to use management techniques as well as the types of meta-governance that are viable are
dependent upon a number of political and policy factors that require additional explication.
Thus, the task of coping with governance will continue to require extensive research and
analysis by both practitioner and academic analysts.</p>
