      <p>1 The argument also seems to be counter-intuitive on ‘contextualist’ grounds
themselves. The appeal to maximizing overall outcomes complicates any justification
for the special protection of minorities, because, presumably, minority interests
are (quantitatively) outweighed by those of the majority on any given issue.</p>

      <p>SAWITRI SAHARSO
Sex-selective abortion (SSA) is a subject that raises troubling questions
about multiculturalism, gender and autonomy that defies a definitive
answer. My article was a step towards addressing this complex issue. I am
grateful therefore to my discussants for their thoughtful comments on my
article.</p>
      <p>Before I respond to what I take to be their major criticisms, let me
correct a factual misunderstanding. The Netherlands does not have, as
Miriam Ticktin thinks, a policy of free access to pre-natal diagnostics
(PND), nor am I arguing that it should have.</p>
      <p>Ticktin claims that I am taking a culturalistic perspective that would
prevent me from seeing what is really at stake. SSA is a practice that,
according to her, is shaped by state violence against and discrimination of
immigrant minority groups. I have no problem in acknowledging that the
Netherlands’ policy towards immigrant groups is harsh and that the racist
prejudice the Dutch display against immigrants is alarming. Yet they do not
constitute the cause of SSA. At the root of the problem is a cultural son
preference and we should be prepared to acknowledge this.</p>
      <p>This sex preference is linked to the tradition of providing a daughter with
a dowry when she marries. In my article, I explained that, due to a process
of commodification of the tradition, some families now demand very
expensive consumer goods for a dowry gift and therefore a daughter’s marriage
may economically ruin a family. This is an important background to this sex
preference. I think, therefore, that I deploy a more materialist notion of
culture than Ticktin thinks.</p>
      <p>Monica Mookherjee believes that I leave women in the cold who are
pressurized into ‘choosing’ SSA, because I do not pay enough attention to the
social conditions under which these women make their choice. According to
her I herewith display a non-relational view on autonomy that sees all of us
as equally free to determine our lives, while Ticktin suggests that I see western
women as fully autonomous and the rest of us as non-autonomous victims of
our culture. I agree that I did not discuss at length how Asian women’s
autonomy can be enhanced, as my focus was on whether measures to ban
SSA should include restricting access to abortion. I consider both Dutch and
Asian women as capable of autonomy, yet both as also constrained in
exercising their autonomy, albeit by different social and cultural conditions.
Making the abortion law more restrictive does not lift these constraints.
Social policy may, however, and therefore this is what I see as a better way
to offer protection to women who are pressurized to undergo a SSA.</p>
      <p>Anne Phillips’s main worry, which she shares with Monica Mookherjee,
is that my contextualism will end in pure pragmatism. Phillips expresses the
classical philosophical preference: first we determine whether a practice is
morally right or wrong (the philosopher’s job), and once we know what
justice requires, the policymaker decides on the implementation of actual
policy. The actual policy-outcome may be co-determined by pragmatic
concerns, but these fall outside the philosophical analysis. I do not believe
in this neat job delineation, moreover, I think that what to do as a matter
of policy is a question that normally also involves moral considerations.</p>
      <p>
        To illustrate my point let me bring forward Stephen Macedo’s discussion
of the Mozert and the Yoder cases. In Mozert v. Hawkins, a conflict over
public education and religious diversity, orthodox Christian parents
objected to the school’s mandatory basic reading program that exposed
their children to a variety of worldviews. The parents claimed a right to
exempt their children from the reading program, while remaining in the
public schools
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Macedo, 1995: 472)</xref>
        . Macedo decided that on principled
grounds the Mozert families should not be accommodated. He added to this
that there are also prudential reasons that might be considered – school
administrators might anticipate that the families would otherwise withdraw
their children altogether from the public school system and for that reason
accommodate them – but these come secondary, and he even doubted
whether courts should at all examine these ‘additional grounds’, as he called
them (1995: 487, 488). Hence, Macedo distinguished between
principlebased and pragmatic arguments while arguing that we should take into
account the former only. Yet, note that Macedo, whilst against
accommodating the Mozert parents, thought it right to accommodate the more
radical claim of Amish’ parents (the Yoder case) to altogether withdraw
their school-aged children from high school, since the Amish, because of
their small number, pose no threat to public order (1995: 472, 489). Hence,
it was ultimately a pragmatic argument about numbers (sic!) that settled for
Macedo whether to accommodate or not. Contextual arguments
interpenetrate with principled arguments. In a contextual approach, this is
acknowledged and considered as inescapable. Principles are generic and as
such underdetermined. To make sense of them and to be able to make a
judgement in specific cases we need contexts.

        This being said, I do share Phillips’s worry that there is the risk to Carens’s
– and as I follow his approach
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Carens, 2000)</xref>
        , also my – contextualism that
we end up with a kind of ‘moral casuistry’, as Seyla
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Benhabib so aptly phrases
it (2002</xref>
        : 125). By this she means the risk that we confuse ‘the normatively
right’ with ‘the institutionally feasible’ (2002: 125). The problem with
Carens’s contextual approach is that pragmatic arguments may co-determine
our moral deliberation, yet it remains unclear to what extent. I think
Benhabib touches the sore spot in Carens’s approach, yet I do not see a ready
solution. New rules of lexical priority? Which ones? Besides, they seem to
go against the grain of the approach. In the meantime, unsatisfactory as it
may seem, we have no choice but to contextually argue it out.
