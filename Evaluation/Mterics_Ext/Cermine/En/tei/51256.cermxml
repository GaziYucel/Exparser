          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Demographic development of
countries and regions of contemporary world is
hugely inconsistent. This can be
explained by the increasing globalisation and
democratisation of international
exchange of human and intellectual resources,
on the one hand, and by the aspiration to
preserve the independence of elites and
ensure the reproduction of the “nation”,
on the other hand. The inconsistencies are further aggravated by such global
trends as population ageing, declining birth rate, transformation of family
traditions, and a general decline in the natural increase rate. These
circumstances emphasise the need for an accurate, timely, and comprehensive
assessment of the demographic situation in certain countries and regions of the
world and possible trends in its short-term development and long-term
forecasting. At the same time, traditional demographic indicators do not always
meet the objective of reflecting global, regional, and country-specific
demographic processes. Traditional demographic rates (for instance, birth and
mortality rates) — although not influenced by the absolute population size — are
affected by numerous structural factors, including the sex structure,
urban/rural population structure, marriage structure, etc. However, one of the
key factors affecting the development trends and the level of other
demographic rates is the age structure of population [1; 5—7].</p>
          <p>Age Structure in Demographic Assessment</p>
          <p>
            The significance of age structure for the demographic situation can be
demonstrated through a comparison of countries that differ considerably in
the level of socioeconomic development, for instance, Poland and Sweden.
In 2010, according to the UN, the former had a mortality rate of 9.8 ‰, the
latter of 10.2 ‰. These rates seem to be comparable. However, the paradox
is that the age specific mortality rates are greater in Poland then in Sweden
almost in all age groups (see table 1). The reason behind it is the
methodology of calculating the mortality rate that uses total population as its
denominator. However, it is not homogenous, in particular, in terms of the age
structure; and different age groups show different mortality rates. Population
aged 0—14 accounted for 14.8 % in Poland and 15 % in Sweden, that aged
15—64—71.7 and 65.5 % respectively, that above 65—13.5 and 19.5 %
respectively [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
            ]. In other words, the age structure of population has a major
effect on the mortality rate, which does not give a comprehensive picture of
the qualitative estimation of mortality.

          <p>Standardisation of Demographic Rates and Demographic Forecasting</p>
          <p>
            Methods that make it possible to mitigate the distortion caused by
structural factors, first of all, the age structure, have already been developed.
One of the ways to navigate around the problem is to use specific rates that
are slightly or not at all affected by structural factors. The other way is to
standardize demographic coefficients. Such standardization is usually based
on factoring overall rates. These factors reflect, on the one hand, the
intensity (level) of the demographic process and, on the other hand, the size or
percentage of the given subpopulation in total population [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
            ]. The essence of
standardisation is that the actual overall rates are compared against the
indicators describing a certain conditional population (real or artificially
created), whose demographic process intensity or structure is used as a
benchmark. The efficiency of chosen methods — direct, indirect or reverse
standardisation — depends on what is taken as a benchmark.
          </p>
          <p>For the purpose of this study, we will turn to indirect standardisation,
which has been widely used for analysing the mortality and — more recently —
birth rate. Statistically, it is based on the age structures of real population as
the benchmark, as well as the age-specific indicators of the demographic
process intensity in standard population. In other words, the age-specific
rates are re-weighted against the age structure of the real population. As a
result, it was possible to project a number of events that would take place in
standard population if its age structure were identical to that of real
population. The correlation between the number of demographic events in
real population with and the expected number is expressed by the indirect
standardisation index. The product of the overall standard rate and the index
is the standardised overall rate, which expresses the probable level of the
overall rate in real population given the age-specific intensity of
demographic processes is similar to those in standard population. It is expressed by
the following formula:</p>
          <p> Р1х  m1x
Iind  х
 Рх1  mx0 ,
х
(1)
where Iind is the indirect standardisation index; Р1х the age structure of
relation population expressed in absolute terms; m1x is the age specific indicators
of the demographic process in standard population; mx0 the age-specific
indicators of the demographic process in the given population.</p>
          <p>When using standardised rates, one should not forget that they do not
have an independent value, because they depend on the chosen benchmark.
Therefore, application of standardised coefficients and corresponding rates
and rankings is limited to comparing different populations under the
condition that the standardisation was conducted using the same method and
benchmark. At the same time, the benchmark should be a population
“sample”, whose demographic (first of all, age) structure is close, although not
similar, to the age structures of the compared populations.</p>
          <p>
            This work presents the first attempt to develop a ranking [2—4; 8; 9]
based on the standardised correlation of the birth and mortality rate for almost
140 countries against the global average and for the Baltic region against the
European average. The study uses the official UN data and the resources of
the World Bank as of 1995 and 2010 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11 ref12">10—12</xref>
            ]. The general formula for
calculating the average birth rate (standardised birth rate correlation — SBRC)
is as follows [2; 8]:
          </p>
          <p>SBRCk = SUMk/Σi (AIBi · POPki),
(2)
where k is the number of a country, i the number of an age group, SBRCk the
value of standardised birth rate correlation for the kth territory; SUMk is the
total annual number of births on the kth territory; AIBi the age-specific
incidence (age-specific birth rate in women of the ith age group), POPki the
average annual size of the ith age group of female population for the kth country.</p>
          <p>The numerator in formula (2) is the actual annual number of births in the
kth country, whereas the denominator is the hypothetical number of births in
the kth country if the age-specific birth rates in women of different ages on
this territory equal the corresponding indicator for a population of a higher
level.</p>
          <p>
            Similarly, one can calculate the standard mortality rate correlation
(SMRCk) — a ratio of the number of deaths in the kth country to the
hypothetical number of deaths under the conditions that the age specific mortality
rates in the country coincide with the global age-specific mortality rates [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
            ].
The formula is as follows:
          </p>
          <p>SMRCk = DEk/Σi (AIDi · PPki).</p>
          <p>In other words, it is a comparison of the same process that is taking place
within two populations — the real and hypothetical ones. The hypothetical
population is the real population of a country characterised by the global
average mortality rate. The ratio of the actual (DEk) to the hypothetical
number of deaths in the kth country is such as if the mortality rate in each age
group i were at the global average: Σi (AIDi × × PPki). In the denominator of
formula (3), AIDi is the age-specific global incidence (per 1,000 population)
in the ith age group; PPki is the average annual size of the ith age group in the
kth country. Therefore the denominator totals the results for each age group
(3)
(5 year age groups correspond to the UN classification), which imparts the
SMRC additional depth and, therefore, reduces the effect of internal
structural characteristics on the final result.</p>
          <p>The 1995 and 2010 SBRC and SMRC-based Ranking of Countries
and the Position of the Baltic Region</p>
          <p>The global SBRC and SMRC-based ranking is presented in tables 2 and 3.
Our calculations allow to identify seven distinct groups in both cases. As to
the SBRC, in all countries of group one (a SBRC of 0.5 and lower), the birth
rate would be twice or more as high if the age-specific incidence of the
process were at the global average. However, the sixth (SBRC of 1.5—2.0) and
seventh (SBRC of above 2.0) groups, whose core is predictably formed by
African countries at the early stage of demographic transitions, are
characterised by values that significantly exceed the standard. In case of the SMRC,
the first group (SMRC of 0.5 and lower) brings together countries that show
a mortality rate significantly below the global average, whereas the sixth and
the sevenths groups are comprised by countries (SMRC of 1.5—2.0 and
above 2.0), whose rates considerably exceed the global average.</p>
          <p>The development of BRC and SMRC-based rankings using an original
methodology [2—4; 8; 9] for two selected years, and their comparison, make
it possible to identify the key trends, work with different scales, and conduct
analysis at different territorial levels — those of individual countries,
regions, and the entire world. The first attempt of a study from the global
perspective resulted in a number of interesting observations and preliminary
conclusions, in particular, those based on the data of a final table of ranking
changes (table 4).</p>
          <p>There are a number of general conclusions that we can make from
studying the data presented above. One, the world of demography remains
highly differentiated, and the range of indicator values is very wide. Two,
spatial distribution of indicators corresponds to the global centre-periphery
model, whose conditional core is the African region with the extraordinary
high both birth and mortality rates and the periphery the more developed
countries characterised, as a rule, by rather low rates. Three, global trends of
decline in the birth and mortality rates exhibit different intensity on different
territories. Moreover, there are numerous examples of reverse and rather
stable trends not only at the national, but also regional levels. Four, the
median group of countries is poorly represented in all SMRC and
SBRCbased rankings (10—17 %), which is indicative of certain illusoriness of
global average values and requires adjustment in each individual case. Five,
the 1995—2010 SBRC ranking structure is characterised by a process of
smoothing the peak, extreme values, whereas an increasing number of
countries consolidated within the range of the global average. If, in 1995, the
third — fifth groups accounted for less than 37 % of all countries, in 2010,
the accounted for 50 %. Sixthly, the development of the SMRC ranking
structure over the same period is characterised by a process of polarisation,
the core of the ranking loses its representatives in favour of the first (+ 2.03)
and the seventh (+ 3,27) groups.

Calculation based on tables 2 and 3.</p>
          <p>In 1995, the Baltic region states formed a rather consolidated cluster in
the SBRC ranking — they comprised the first two groups with a significant
but unfulfilled potential. Over the following years, a pronounced divergence
between them emerged. Without going into detail (it is a subject for a
separate study), one can state that, against the global demographic background,
only Poland demonstrates a stable downward trends as to the birth rate and
only Germany is characterised by “negative stability”. The other countries
improved their situation as compared to the global average by 2010.</p>
          <p>As to the SMRC, the overall trends in the regional development are
positive. The position of only two countries deteriorated of the period —
Russia moved down one position to group five and Lithuania to group four.
Latvia remained in the fourth group, whereas the other six Baltic region states
experience a “demographic transition” that accompanied the positive trend.
Today, with the exception of Poland and Estonia, they are in the group of
countries with the lowest mortality rate in the world.</p>
          <p>The Baltic Region States in European Rankings</p>
          <p>For a number of reasons, European countries have traditionally shown a
low birth rate (SBRC &lt; 1) at the global level, however, the situation is not
homogenous. Against this background, in 1995, the Baltic region states
comprised a rather coherent group with relatively favourable characteristics
(tables 5, 6).

          <p>In almost all countries, the SBRC was around 1.3, which means an
increased age-specific incidence of births against the European average
standard. However, the following period saw a steep decline in the SBRC,
although it did not occur at the same pace. As of 2010, Denmark retained its
position in the ranking followed by Sweden and Finland. This situation is a
result of a number of factors, which include high standard of living and a
consistent policy aimed at increasing the birth rate pursued since the 1970s.
Probably, a certain contribution is made by a large influx of migrants (in
Sweden, they account for 15—19 % of population according to different
estimates) that exhibit increased fertility (often, of more than three children
per woman of reproductive age). Four countries of the region — Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia — are approximately at the European average,
whereas Germany (despite the high standards of living and a large influx of
migrates) and Poland are characterised by a gradual decrease in the birth rate
since the mid-1990s.</p>
          <p>The analysis shows that, in and around 1995, the mortality rate was the
leading differentiating factor of the demographic situation in the Baltic
region states. While in the SBRC the countries show similar results, in the
SMRC they are divided into two equal groups. The rates of the first group
are below the European average standard (Sweden, Finland, Germany, and
Denmark), those of the second group are above that (Poland, the Baltics, and
Russia). Over the next 15 years, the situation remained stable. The
composition of the first group and the values of the SMRC did not significantly
change, however, Denmark improved its position and topped the ranking.
The trends characteristic of the second group of countries are more
ambiguous. For instance, Poland and, notably, Estonia reached the European
average in terms of SMRC and occupied a central position in the Baltic region
ranking against the background of a decrease in the age-specific incidence.
An opposite trend is observed in Lithuania and Russia. The latter’s rate
(1.53, sic!) emphasises the acuteness and depth of the demographic crisis
caused, according to experts, by a combination of numerous factors of
demoeconomic, socioeconomic, sociomedical, and socio-ethical nature.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>The search for new tools of a more accurate and effective assessment of
the demographic situation in individual countries and regions made it
possible to discover a unified approach to developing demographic rankings
(designed for and tested on Russian regions using the data of official Russian
statistics) in the works of S. P. Ermakov and N. A. Shmakov [2—4; 8; 9].
Standardised birth and mortality rates minimise the significance of structural
differences in the population of different territories. Therefore, it becomes
possible to make comparisons at any level — from the global to municipal
one. The first attempt to apply the method to long-term international
statistical data proved its validity and applicability to the studies in the field.
Notable conclusions regarding the nature of certain development trends in
the birth and mortality rates in both the global and macroregional context
were achieved. New experimental data were obtained and the features of
development of demographic processes in the Baltic region were identified.
At the same time, the results obtained require further investigation, detailed
interpretation, and an in-depth analysis, also that at the level of individual
countries and regions. Moreover, the “pure” data on the condition of
population and demographic processes seems to be important for all relevant
authorities. This information can be used in the formulation and targeted
implementation of both demographic and social policies.</p>
