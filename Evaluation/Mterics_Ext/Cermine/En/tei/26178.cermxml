The paper analyzes the radical right‘s attitudes toward the EU focusing in particular on the
level of congruence between the programmatic statements of the central office and the
voting behavior of their MEPs. It shows that although radical right parties represent a source
of opposition to the EU, within the EP they express their dissent making use of the rules of
the game, voting with the opposition more than the other forces do, but voting almost as
much with the majority. The party public office in the EP is inserted in the legislative process
and even more collusive with the other parties of both sides of the political spectrum than the
Eurosceptical rhetoric and statements of central office makes the public believe.</p>

          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Many studies show that Euroscepticism has become an ideological pillar of radical right
parties. It is a theme that has acquired greater salience within the political discourse of this
area, to the point that these parties have become the main stronghold of EU-pessimism
(Mudde 2007). Particularly, their political discourse has largely internalized the EU issue,
making the radical right the political area where this issue has become more salient (Kriesi
2007). In this paper, I analyze the radical right‘s attitudes toward the EU focusing in particular
on the level of congruence between the programmatic statements and the voting behavior of
their MEPs. Notably, the aim of the paper is to describe the problem along the following
lines:
1) an analysis of the level of congruence of party positions within the programmatic
supply of these parties, as well as within the voting behavior of their MEPs;
2) an analysis of the level of congruence between the political discourse of the party
central office and the voting behavior of the party in public office.</p>
          <p>
            It is an approach that aims at integrating several dimensions of party attitudes toward the EU
examined by earlier studies, such as the dimension of the political discourse that was
examined through the party manifestos for the European elections (Gabel &amp; Hix 2004), and
of the institutional behavior of politicians that was examined through the voting behavior of
MEPs
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Hix et al. 2007)</xref>
            . In sum, through the analysis of party Euromanifestos and roll-call
votes in the European Parliament, I will produce a description of what radical right parties
say about Europe, what their MEPs do in order to translate the party rhetoric into concrete
political action, and how congruent these two dimensions of the party stance on the EU are.
From the theoretical point of view, the paper will contribute to understanding politics and the
behavior of the radical right in different ways. Firstly, the results of the comparative analysis
will allow us to determine whether the radical right behaves cohesively enough to present the
character of a real party family. Or, alternatively, it will determine whether the empirical
evidence supports the argument – maintained by the founder of the German Republicans
Franz Schönhuber among others (in Mudde 2007: 159) – that a genuine European radical
right does not really exist.
          </p>
          <p>Secondly, assessing the level of congruence between the attitudes of different faces of party
organization is a relevant problem that current research has just started to address (Conti, Cotta &amp;
Tavares de Almeida 2010). Particularly, assessing the extent to which the official party stance on the
EU overlaps with that of party officials holding public office is meaningful for a comprehensive
understanding of the broad phenomenon of party attitudes toward the EU. Recent research shows that
citizens are way less pro-European than politicians (Best, Lengyel &amp; Verzichelli forthcoming). Given the
gap in the support for the EU between citizens and politicians, it is particularly relevant to study
whether the party central office pools together with the party in public office or whether it takes more
cautious positions. In other words, does the stance of the MEPs within the European Parliament (EP)
reflect the party discourse on the EU developed for usage in the electoral market? The comparison
between the attitudes of the party central office and those of the MEPs presented in this paper will
allow us to answer this question.</p>

          <title>What the Radical</title>
          <p>In order to analyze the attitudes of radical right parties toward the EU and to describe the
main components of these attitudes (dissatisfaction with the defense of national interests,
opposition to EU policies, protest against loss of sovereignty) I will examine the party
positions on a set of specific issues. I will start my analysis with a study of party
Euromanifestos, the programs that the national parties present for the EP elections. These
documents provide a useful representation of the ideological structure and of the policy
preferences of parties. Radical parties tend to have a particularly good electoral performance
at the EP elections given the second-order nature of the scrutiny, and thanks to the PR
nature of the electoral system. Their visibility in these elections tends to be high and their
programmatic assertiveness is consequently also high. It is important to note that
Euromanifestos are usually issued by the party central office and they present the overall
party line for use with the party rank and file and with the electorate. Thus, these documents
reflect a unitary vision of the party and do not offer much evidence of any eventual intra-party
division. This limitation that is intrinsic to any manifesto analysis is also the starting point for
an interesting research question: Is a party cohesive enough in its stance on the EU? As was
mentioned in the introduction, this paper begins to address the problem by means of a
comparison between the analysis of party manifestos that I present in this section, and that
of the voting behavior of the MEPs in the following section.</p>
          <p>Given the level of complexity and the increasing number of policy areas where the EU is involved, it
seems useful to break-down party attitudes across many aspects of European integration. This attempt
allows for a disentanglement of party attitudes across different dimensions of the EU process and a
determination whether the same stance is confirmed across such dimensions. For this purpose, I will
focus the analysis in particular on the dimensions of representation and policy. It is a research strategy
that aims at including several functional aspects of supranational integration in the analysis. In the
recent past, the theoretical debate (Bartolini 2007; Benhabib 2002; Cotta e Isernia 2009) as well as
some empirical studies (Conti &amp; Memoli 2010; Hooghe, Marks &amp; Wilson 2004; Hubé &amp; Rambour 2010;
Gabel &amp; Hix 2004) have defined these dimensions as relevant for the analysis of the EU impact on
member states and of the response of political actors to such an impact.

The data base used for this part of the analysis was created by the IntUne project.1 A group
of national experts coded 298 Euromanifestos2 of all political areas in fifteen member states.3
Although these documents refer to the 1979-2004 period, the large majority actually refer to
1994-2004.4 One could claim that parties may have changed their attitudes over this period.
In fact, this does not seem to be the case for radical parties, as the empirical analysis has
already shown that a change in the attitudes toward the EU can be found mainly in the
moderate parties (Gabel &amp; Hix 2004). On the contrary, radical parties are not inclined to
change their attitudes on the EU, they tend instead to be rather stable in their opposition
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Szcerbiack &amp; Taggart 2003, 2008)</xref>
          that, over time, has only become more salient, especially
in the case of the radical right (Kriesi 2007). We expect, therefore, variations across time to
be quite limited in scope, but I will report them anyway when they are deemed relevant.
The analysis starts with an examination of the level of occurrence of the selected themes
within the Euromanifestos. In table 2, we find evidence of the fact that, in their documents
radical parties generally refer to such themes as often as (or even more often than)
mainstream parties do. Certainly, the table does not contain any information about the
direction of the positions expressed on the specific issues in the documents. However, it was
relevant to find confirmation that the analyzed themes do play an important role in the party
discourse on the EU. They are important components of the party stance on the EU.
Although across parties some differences can be found in terms of frequency of occurrence,
overall, the selected themes recurred frequently in the Euromanifestos (in between 51.7 and
88.8 per cent of Euromanifestos, depending on the theme). Hence, we can be confident that
they represent good empirical referents for the analysis of party attitudes toward the EU as
they really structured the programmatic supply provided in the Euromanifestos.

financed by the VI Framework Programme of the European Union (CIT3-CT-2005-513421). The research in this
paper was also supported by the Italian National project ―Il processo di integrazione europea in una fase di stallo
istituzionale: mutamenti nelle sfere della rappresentanza politica, dei processi decisionali e della cittadinanza
sociale‖ financed by the Ministery of Education (PRIN 2007).
2 Among these documents there are thirty Euromanifestos of the radical right.

        <p>The analysis moves now to a more in-depth examination of the direction of party positions.
For this purpose, I applied multinomial logistic regression models for the analysis of the
content analytic variables drawn from the Euromanifestos. This technique allowed me to
estimate the likelihood for radical parties to express Eurosceptical positions as compared to
mainstream parties. Subsequently, within the radical party category I separated left from
right. The comparison of attitudes between parties of different ideological orientations allows
us to understand the phenomenon of Euroscepticism comparatively and to insert these
attitudes within the broader context of inter-party competition and of contestation of the EU
issue. Precisely, multinomial logistic regression models estimate the likelihood of different
cases to belong to each category of the dependent variable when compared to a reference
category. For example, in table 3, the ExpB coefficient estimates the likelihood of each
category of the dependent variable ‗membership‘ to occur compared to the reference
category ‗favourable opportunities‘. In other words, the model estimates how likely it is to find
in the Euromanifestos (of the mainstream and radical parties respectively) ‗no reference‘, a
‗mixed‘ or a ‗negative‘ evaluation of the country membership, compared to the reference
category ‗favourable opportunities‘. I found that in their Euromanifestos, radical parties have
almost eleven times (ExpB=10.75) greater a likelihood to represent membership as a
negative constraint than to represent it as a positive opportunity. On the contrary, such
likelihood is almost null (ExpB=0.2) for mainstream parties.5 In particular, I found that 70% of
the Euromanifestos of the radical right (and 64.7% of those of the radical left) expressed a
negative evaluation of the country membership. Consequently, the expectation of a broad
Eurosceptism rooted in the radical parties is confirmed by the data.
5 I considered mainstream parties to be those belonging to the following party families: Christian democrats,
socialists, liberals, conservatives, regionalists (with the exception of the Northern League), greens and some other
moderate parties on indication of the national experts involved in the research. I categorized Communists, extreme
left, nationalists and the extreme right as radical parties.</p>

With this negative evaluation of membership on the side of radical parties follows their strong emphasis
on the necessity for the national government to oppose decisions at the EU level that could constrain
the member states. In order to find evidence of this, I analyzed how parties think the national
government should behave in the EU arena. In table 4, ‗defence/rejection‘ is the reference category. I
found that mainstream parties are eight times (ExpB=8.18) more likely to express a preference for a
cooperative behavior, thus for an acquiescent conduct of the national government. Furthermore, they
are over five times more likely (ExpB=5.63) to prefer the leadership of the national government within
the EU arena, hence to be in favor of a voice option. In the end, as it was easy to predict, mainstream
parties are divided on the assertiveness and the role that the national government should have within
the EU. On the contrary, the category of radical parties is more focused on the ‗defence/rejection‘
solution, while the likelihood for the Euromanifestos of these parties to fall in any other category is not
significant.6 However, it is important to highlight the differences in the attitudes of the two extremes.
The ‗defence/rejection‘ category occurs in 43.3% of Euromanifestos of radical right parties as
compared to 6.7% of those of the radical left whose most recurrent category (38.2%) is instead that of
cooperation7 (occurring in only 6.7% of Euromanifestos of the radical right). These results show that,
although Euroscepticism is deeply rooted in the radical parties under the form of a broad attitude, for
instance when they evaluate country membership, when we break-down the broad stance into more
specific attitudes we find that Euroscepticism is definitely more pronounced in the radical right.
6 Changing the reference category does not change the result, as radical parties have a tendency to concentrate
their preference in the ‗defence/rejection‘ category.</p>
        <p>7 In particular, Izquierda Unida and Synaspimos are the main advocate of this solution within the radical left.</p>
        <p>The national government should
prioritize
Moving the analysis to the policy dimension, we find the same pattern. In particular, we find
the same tendency for attitudes toward foreign and defense policy. In table 5, mainstream
parties show 9.9 and 9.2 times greater likelihood respectively for the exclusive EU
competence and a shared EU-national competence, as compared to the reference category
of the exclusive national competence. So, mainstream parties are rather divided in terms of
degree of involvement of the EU in foreign policy, something that could explain the difficulties
in integrating the ex-Second Pillar of the EU. However, they agree overwhelmingly on some
kind of involvement of the EU, while they voice a preference for the exclusive national
competence only very rarely. The same tendency can be found for defense policy (tab. 6) as
the preference of mainstream parties for the exclusive European competence and for the
shared EU-national competence is 12.3 and 10.3 times greater than for the reference
category of exclusive national competence. For both policies, values for the radical parties
are instead not significant. The reason can be found in the dispersion of their preferences
across different categories. Dispersion occurs between radical left and radical right, as well
as across countries. Overall, the preference of radical parties for the exclusive national
competence exceeds that for any other option. They voice this sovereignist stance in foreign
and defense policy in 27% and 25% of their Euromanifestos respectively, without any
particular distinction between left and right. However, somewhat unexpectedly, the share for
the other categories is also similar. Notably, over time the radical left – but not the radical
right – becomes more supportive of the EU competence, until a peak in 2004 when 66.6% of
the Euromanifestos of the radical left supports the EU competence (either exclusive or
shared) in foreign policy and 53.9% in defense policy8.</p>
        <p>In sum, differences between mainstream and radical parties are remarkable since the EU involvement
in these two policy areas is much less popular with radical parties. However, only a minority of radical
parties rejects the EU involvement in principle, while on this issue the radical left has become
increasingly aligned with mainstream parties over time. In the end, the radical right is the main
stronghold of opposition against the communitarisation of foreign and defense policy. However, even
for these parties, Euroscepticism is not absolute. Although integration of these policies deeply
challenges one of the core values of the radical right, namely the defense of national sovereignty, its
national components are divided on what is the best level of competence. In some countries, radical
right parties support some EU competence in foreign and defense policy9 as they see the EU as a
potential barrier against globalization and U.S dominance that they oppose more fiercely: against both
forces, any national scale action would be powerless, especially from countries of small size or
reduced strategic power. Ultimately, although at various degrees and certainly more to the left than to
the right, the EU has acquired some legitimacy as a level of governance even within the programmatic
supply of radical parties. Euroscepticism in this sphere prevails in the radical right, but as we have
seen, not unanimously.</p>

We move now to the analysis of immigration policy. On the one hand, the likelihood of a
preference for the exclusive EU competence or the shared EU-national competence on the
side of mainstream parties is almost eight (ExpB=7.75) and five (ExpB=5.13) times greater
than it is for exclusive national competence (reference category). However, a lack of
reference to immigration issues is the most likely possibility for mainstream parties
(ExpB=14.38). On the other hand, the preferences of radical parties are again dispersed
among different categories. Even more than for foreign and defense policy, such dispersion
is to be attributed mainly to the radical left. As a matter of fact, the position of radical right
parties is more univocal as 42.9% of their Euromanfestos support the exclusive national
competence in immigration policy. It is evidence of the fact that radical right parties make
their programmatic supply on this issue very distinctive from that of the other parties and
characterize their stance along the lines of a more openly nationalistic posture. Although less
than half of the Euromanifestos of the radical right really favor the most nationalistic solution,
the other more recurrent category is the no reference one, especially in the new member
states10, while a preference for the EU involvement in the immigration policy is only residual
among radical right parties.11
10 For example, in 2004, the Lithuanian National Centre Party and Party of National Progress, and the League of</p>
        <p>Polish Families did not make any reference to the issue of the favourite level of competence in immigration policy.
11 Only the Italian MSI-National Alliance in 1994 and the German Republicans in 1999-2004 supported the
involvement of the EU in this policy.
Reference category: exclusive
national
To conclude this part of the analysis, I can summarize that I found confirmation of the fact
that the radical right is the main stronghold of party-based Euroscepticism. However, this
attitude is broad more than it is absolute, and most importantly, it is not univocal across the
European countries. Although still very criticized, the EU has acquired legitimacy by radical
right parties in some member states where its role as a policy-maker is relatively welcome.
The very existence of the EU is therefore not questioned by these parties. The
Euroscepticism of the radical right is still quite strident, especially if one compares their
attitudes to those of mainstream parties and even of radical left parties whose opposition
against the EU has become more nuanced over time. Still, it would be difficult to talk about a
principled opposition of the radical right against the EU when parties are so divided about the
role the EU should play in the European system of governance.

          <p>The paper now moves to the analysis of the institutional behavior of the MEPs of the radical
right. Specifically, I will examine whether they vote cohesively within the EP. As a matter of
fact, in the previous section it has already been shown that the programmatic supply of the
radical right is characterized by some common positions, as well as by some important
differences. We now investigate whether these differences also translate into a diverse
behavior of radical right MEPs within the EP. In addition, this part of the analysis allows us to
shed a light on the problem of the level of coherence existing between the protest-based
rhetoric of radical right parties in the election campaign (however mitigated by specific policy
positions that, as we have seen, are not so much opposed to the EU) and their institutional
behavior after the elections.</p>
          <p>For the analysis, I have selected the EP group ‗Independence/Democracy‘ (IND/DEM) of the
2004-2009 legislature. The group was created in 2004, when parties from the Eurosceptical
‗Europe of Democracy and Diversities‘ group made an alliance with some parties from the
new member states. The most important parties of IND/DEM were the following12: the UK
Independence Party (UKIP), the League of Polish Families, the Italian Northern League
(suspended in 2006 and then expelled from the group after the scandal of the t-shirt worn by
the party member Calderoli showing anti-Islamic cartoons), and the Movement for France.
Additionally, some MEPs from Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands and
Sweden also took part in the group. However, other important radical right parties such as
the French Front National and the Vlaams Belang did not join IND/DEM and decided instead
to belong to the ‗Non Attached‘ group. By the end of the legislature, especially after the
expulsion of the Northern League, the group could rely on just 2.8 per cent of the seats in the
EP. Definitely, this lack of unity within the EP of radical right parties gives evidence of a lack
of cohesion of their intents and strategy. So the argument of whether they could be
considered a genuine party family finds negative evidence here. At least, these parties are
not transnationally organized as most other party families are and this, in turn, creates an
impediment for the establishment of greater coherence of action within this political area.
This lack of transnational organization also creates a problem for the analysis carried in this
paper: due to dispersion of the radical right MEPs in various groups, any result on IND/DEM
only partially represents the radical right as a whole. Furthermore, the empirical referent
considered in the two parts of the analysis is not identical, as the Euromanifesto data
examined in the previous section referred to a larger number of radical right parties than the
data on the voting behavior of the MEPs of Independence/Democracy. However, I will show
that in spite of these limitations, it is still possible to produce some considerations and to
advance some tentative conclusions about the phenomena under analysis.
12 The group ceased to exist in 2009 when some of its components united with the remnants of the ‗Union for a
Europe of Nations‘ group to create a new group called ‗Europe of Freedom and Democracy‘.
The first problem that I am going to explore concerns the internal cohesion within IND/DEM.
For this purpose, in table 8 I have reported a measurement elaborated by Hix and Noury of
the internal cohesion of the EP groups in the period 2004-2009 based on the roll-call votes
(all data in this section are available on-line at http://www.votewatch.eu).13 It clearly emerged
that within the EP context, IND/DEM was the group with lower internal cohesion,
comparatively as low as the Non-Attached group. To be more precise, their level of cohesion
was about half the average level (0.8) of all party groups with the exclusion of IND/DEM and
the Non-Attached. On the other extreme of the political spectrum, the European United
Left/Nordic Green Left group (GUE-NGL) showed a level of internal cohesion in line with the
above mentioned average. Hence, the radical right was internally divided along its national
components much more than any other group of the EP was. Indeed, we only need to recall
that some ideological diversity also emerged in the Euromanifesto analysis, but strikingly
wide divisions emerged in the way the radical right MEPs voted in the EP. It is interesting to
note that the low level of internal cohesion of the IND/DEM is also confirmed when we
disaggregate votes by policy areas, as scores tend to be close to the overall cohesion rate:
0.5 for budgetary policy, economics, foreign and defense policy, culture and
education;
0.4 for justice and home affairs, unemployment, social policy, development,
transportation, tourism, fishery, equal opportunities;
0.3 for agriculture, environment, industry, energy, research, internal market.
Precisely, among the parties in this group, the UKIP voted against the party line one out of
three times and the League of Polish Families one out of five.14 Hence, among the larger
parties that formed the group, the latter was the one that contributed more to determine the
party line. However, its defection rate of one fifth should not be ignored and it is the sign of a
rather undisciplined conduct and lack of leadership within the political group. Since we
registered an extremely low level of internal cohesion, this could not be explained by the
defections of the British and the Polish MEPS alone. It follows that the other MEPs of the
group representing even smaller parties have all together defected the party line more
frequently.
13For each vote, the group cohesion was calculated using the index of Rice: (Y-N)/(Y+N+A), where Y = nr. of votes
in favour, N = nr. of votes against and A = nr. of abstentions. The cohesion rate of each group is the mean score of
all roll-call votes.
14The other parties of IND/DEM have less than five representatives in the group. It is not possible to calculate
loyalty scores for national groups with less than five MEPs. A national group is made up by MEPs from the same
member state who join the same European Political Group.</p>

        <p>EPP
Having established that radical right parties within the EP are not cohesive, it is now
interesting to analyze how they behave vis a vis the other parties. One underlying
characteristic of radical right parties is indeed their anti-system rhetoric. For this reason, they
have alternatively been labeled as populist, extreme right, fascist, or protest-based
organizations (Mudde 2007, 29). Indeed, at the national level, they often reject the system
from its constitutional foundations. At the same time, the system tends to exclude them; at
the national level several institutional barriers such as those coming from the electoral rules
have been built in order to marginalize these parties. So, with only some exceptions and
contrary to mainstream parties, radical right parties are usually rooted on the ground of the
society more than they are in public office. As a consequence, they are also largely excluded
from public resources - consisting mostly of state financing - that are instead largely
available to cartel parties (Katz &amp; Mair1995). Hence, at the national level radical right parties
can successfully represent themselves as separate from the system and their distinctiveness
as a form of non-collusion and disinterestedness. They can do so especially when they
criticize the state elites, one of the main arguments in their rhetoric. What happens then
when we shift the focus of the analysis to the EU system? Is their anti-system protest also
transferred to the EU level? We found that the Euromanfestos are rich in criticisms to the
country membership in the EU. (table 3). Now we analyze whether such a broad stance also
corresponds to an institutional practice of outsiders within the EP.</p>
        <p>In reality, the tendency of IND/DEM, as well as of the radical left, to a participatory and even
collusive behavior within the EP should not be underestimated (table 9). Although the
number of times this group was part of a majority in the EP was the lowest among all party
groups, the total rate (46.2 per cent) is still considerable and certainly higher than we could
expect from any anti-system force. Hence, in almost half of the cases, IND/DEM was part of
a parliamentary majority. To be sure, their votes only converged with large majorities
composed of at least two large parties (the European People‘s Party [EPP], the European
Socialist Party [PSE], or the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe [ALDE]).
Therefore, their vote was not necessary to build minimum winning coalitions, and
consequently their blackmail potential and coalition power remained very limited even when
they joined a majority. Just as at the national level (where only few exceptions can be found
in countries such as Austria and Italy), also in the EP the radical right is largely non-influent
for the formation of coalitions. For this reason, it is surprising that they voted along the lines
of a parliamentary majority so many times. Especially when we consider that only a fraction
of the votes of IND/DEM converged with those of parliamentary majorities of centre-right
leaning parties (either EPP, ALDE or Union for the Europe of Nations [UEN]) and could
therefore be justified on the bases of some common ideological inclinations. In most cases,
the majority also included (to a greater or lesser degree) the PSE, the Greens, and the
GUENGL. An in-depth analysis of the contents of the bills passed with the support of IND/DEM
would be necessary in order to discover the motivations for their institutional behavior – one
that could certainly not be labeled as the behavior of outsiders. It is, however, a research
goal that goes beyond the scope of the analysis presented in this paper, but one that future
research should consider in order to shed light on this interesting phenomenon concerning
the institutional behavior of the public office of radical right parties.</p>

Certainly, convergence with the EP majority is also due to the consensual nature of the EP
where decisions are often lowest common denominator agreements among the different
forces that are represented in this assembly. However, even from this perspective, we could
not avoid defining the strategy of the radical right in the EP as either one of voice, or one of
acquiescence. Being that their votes converged with those of large coalitions and were
therefore not necessary to form a majority, we can hypothesize that the blackmail potential of
IND/DEM was really limited on those occasions, as well as their capacity to influence the
final outcome in the decision-making process. Hence, their strategy should really be
characterized by acquiescence more than by a real capacity to voice their preferences and
force the other parties to compromise with them. In the end, it seems that radical right parties
are rather maximalists on the EU in their rhetoric (although even in this respect the analysis
of Euromanifestos has shown that in some countries they accept the EU as a level of
governance) but they tend to exclude the most maximalist option of exit when they operate
within the EU institutions. This result is also confirmed by the attendance rate (82.5%) to the
plenary sessions of the EP by the MEPs of IND/DEM, a rate that is very close to the average
of the other (mostly mainstream) groups (84.6%). As we have seen, a vote with the majority
corresponds to this high attendance rate in almost half of the cases and a vote against (or
abstention) in the remaining part. Only when they vote against the majority do they express
their protest against the main groups, usually by voting with parties on the extremes of both
left and right (Hagemann 2009). It is evident that radical right parties collect votes in the
European elections based on a broad Eurosceptical stance (with policy specific positions
that are sometimes not as much Eurosceptical). However, once in the EP, it is important to
note that they express their dissent making use of the rules of the game, voting with the
opposition more than the other forces do, but voting almost as much with the majority. If
these figures were known by the larger public, it would not be surprising if the protest-based
electorate of these parties felt dissatisfied with their institutional conduct.</p>
        <p>It seems that the public office of these parties is way less anti-EU than the political discourse
of their central office. There may be several explanations for this behavior. On the one hand,
there might be a search for legitimacy on the part of these parties. They want to participate in
the decision-making process and they want to be considered credible coalition partners. This
could be achieved more easily in an assembly such as the EP where coalitions are formed
on an issue-by-issue basis, rather than following pre-arranged coalition agreements between
either the groups or the national delegations. On the other hand, radical right parties might
be aware of the advantages which come with representation in the EP. They can have a
public office that is often lacking at the national level where they are frequently excluded
from institutional representation due to electoral rules, the impact of strategic voting in first
order elections, or the marginalization by mainstream parties. The advantages of
representation in the EP are not negligible, especially for small radical parties. Notably, from
a financial point of view, parties represented in the EP have access to public financing, which
has become so relevant for the survival of parties in contemporary times (Katz &amp; Mair 1995,
Aucante &amp; Dézé 2008). Such funds come directly from the EU budget, in order to allow the
organizational functioning of the EP. As well, they come from the national budget under the
form of ordinary contributions or reimbursements of the electoral expenses. Ultimately, either
directly or indirectly, the EP is doing a lot for the financial and organizational survival of small
radical parties. Alternatively, we could look for other non-strategic explanations of the
institutional behavior of radical right MEPs. Just like any other actor who is inserted in the
European decision-making system, they become gradually socialized to the practices and
principles of the EU governance, through forms of interaction oriented toward consensualism
that in the long term create a sense of trust and identification with the institution and with the
system at large (Schimmelfennig 2000). This could also explain why the radical right often
takes a more pragmatic stance in the EP than the rhetoric of their central office would
anticipate. None of these potential explanations can be examined in-depth in this paper, but
certainly knowledge on the radical right, as well as on EU politics, would greatly benefit from
the analysis of these possible determinants of the party conduct in the EP. In the meanwhile,
although it is not yet possible to talk about a radical right in the EU that is anti-establishment
but open to government it seems there is already enough evidence to talk about a radical
right that is anti-establishment and part of the system.</p>
        <sec id="sec-3-28-1">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>The analysis that was carried out in this paper shows that the radical right is the party block
characterized by the lowest levels of internal cohesion in the whole context of the European
party families. This finding holds true both in the analysis of ideology that was examined
through party Euromanifestos, and in that of institutional behavior shown by the data on the
roll-call votes of the MEPs. The Euroscepticism of the radical right is well-known, however
after an accurate analysis, it showed that it is discontinuous and lacks a common vision
across its national party components. If this diversity was verified not only with respect to the
European issue but to other issues as well, there would be reason to question whether the
radical right could be defined as a party family, or if it should instead be considered a
disordered aggregation of national parties of erratic ideological positions.</p>
          <p>The analysis of two different arenas, namely a second-order national electoral arena and the
EP institutional arena, very clearly show that the radical right in Europe is divided into a
plethora of stances and policy preferences and by reciprocal enmities and political
antagonism. From the analyses, it emerged that their ideological foundations, programmatic
supply and organizational features are so diverse that it even seems hard to group them
under a distinctive party family name. This finding reinforces Mudde‘s (2007) argument about
the necessity to classify parties that common wisdom tends to pinpoint within the radical right
with more accuracy. Certainly, this paper shows that in Europe, a famille spirituelle grouping
the main parties of this political area is, in reality, hardly discernible and even the use of the
concept of party family could be incorrect when referring to the radical right.
At the same time, a clear tendency toward a greater pragmatism and moderation of the
MEPs of the radical right emerged in the paper as compared to the party programmatic
announcements. Although radical right parties represent a source of opposition within the
EP, some of them also take part in parliamentary majorities in almost the same proportion.
This phenomenon shows that there is a remarkable distance between the central office and
the public office of these parties, at least in terms of coherence between the statements of
the former and the institutional conduct of the latter. Whether this is a conscious, or even a
strategic game played by these parties, is a question that this paper has not addressed.
Certainly, their conduct raises many questions that future research may address. Overall, the
party public office in the EP is more institutionalized, more inserted in the legislative process
and even more collusive with the other parties of both sides of the political spectrum than the
rhetoric and statements of central office makes the public believe. The paper documented
the ambivalence between a more Eurosceptical party central office and a more collusive EP
public office. This conflicting valence between central office and public office could be a sign
of difficulty for these parties in playing the role of legislators and, at the same time, represent
a protest-based electorate. Especially in an assembly like the EP where there is not a clear
government to oppose and so the temptation to collude with the other parties can be
amplified. Whether or not this phenomenon limits the capacity of radical right parties in the
EP to represent their electorate - as they fail to deliver firm opposition against the
mainstream parties - is an interesting problem. At the same time, however, the level of
information of citizens about the activities in the EP is so low that a disappointing behavior of
the MEPs would hardly result in a sanction vote in the following elections. So, it was
interesting to document that in an assembly characterized by limited popular scrutiny as is
the EP, the conduct of some radical right parties is not one of principled opposition, it is
actually less extreme than many would expect.</p>
