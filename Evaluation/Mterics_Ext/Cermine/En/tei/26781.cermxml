        <p>In this article we present estimates of the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate in Western and Eastern Germany from 1955 to 2008. Tempo adjustment of the total fertility rate (TFR) requires data on the annual number of births by parity and age of the mother. Since official statistics do not provide such data for West Germany as well as Eastern Germany from 1990 on we used alternative data sources which include these specific characteristics. The combined picture of conventional TFR and tempo-adjusted TFR* provides interesting information about the trends in period fertility in Western and Eastern Germany, above all with regard to the differences between the two regions and the enormous extent of tempo effects in Eastern Germany during the 1990s. Compared to corresponding data for populations from other countries, our estimates of the tempo-adjusted TFR* for Eastern and Western Germany show plausible trends. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the estimates of the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate presented in this paper should not be seen as being on the level of or equivalent to official statistics since they are based on different kinds of data with different degrees of quality.</p>

        The East-West German differences in fertility trends which have been observed
over many decades are probably the most frequently studied aspect of the
demographic differences between Eastern and Western Germany. Above all the changes
in Eastern German fertility have been frequently studied in recent years
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref14 ref15 ref2 ref26 ref31 ref32 ref34 ref38 ref41 ref42">(e.g.

        , and are regarded as the main characteristic of the
“demographic shock” experienced by the population in the new Federal Länder after the
political changes
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Eberstadt 1994)</xref>
        . The level of fertility and its changes over time
are particularly important because they have the strongest long-term impact on the
age structure of a population
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(Luy 2009)</xref>
        . This is why the determinants of fertility
and of childlessness in the context of the specific backgrounds of life in Western
and Eastern Germany have been analysed intensively in recent years

        For most politically and socially relevant questions the absolute numbers of
births are of primary interest since these determine the future numbers of
kindergarten children, school pupils, students, employed persons or pensioners, albeit
the size of these population groups is additionally determined by mortality and
migration. Demographic fertility research, by contrast, studies primarily the relative
fertility quantum in order to be able to describe changes and differences between
populations and to identify the corresponding determinants and influencing factors.
The demographic indicator used most frequently in the field of period analysis – i.e.
the analysis of fertility conditions in a specific calendar year – is the “total fertility
rate” (TFR) which is often interpreted as the “average number of children”. However,
it is generally difficult in the period analysis to give a specific meaning to such
measures. This is only possible in the cohort perspective, in which the fertility of a real
cohort is analysed year by year on a longitudinal basis. Period analysis, by contrast,
summarizes the fertility of a specific calendar year using the age-specific fertility
rates of all women who were between 15 and 49 years old in this calendar year. By
summing up the age-specific fertility rates to the total fertility rate, a hypothetical
cohort is constructed which is supposed to represent the current fertility conditions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37 ref46">(see Sobotka and Lutz 2010 on the problem of the use of the period TFR for
questions of political and societal relevance)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>The observed or reconstructed number of births of women belonging to a
certain cohort can be influenced by specific period and cohort effects. In general, these
effects are not seen as distortions, but rather as causal determinants of cohort
fertility and are thus of central interest of the analysis. Period analysis, by contrast,
aims to describe the “pure” fertility level of a specific calendar year– the so-called
“quantum of fertility” – without including any other structural factors determining
or influencing the level of fertility. A classical structural factor influencing the overall
fertility level is the age composition of a population, which can have a major impact
on the number of births. Thus, demographic period indicators such as the TFR are
calculated as age-standardised measures. (Although cohort indicators are
generally calculated age-standardised as well, no comparable distortion effects of the
age composition can occur here).</p>
      <p>
        At the end of the 1990s,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Bongaarts and Feeney (1998)</xref>
        showed that changes in
the average age at childbirth occurring during a calendar year alter fertility rates and
hence the TFR, a phenomenon that has been described already by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">Hajnal (1947)</xref>
        .
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Bongaarts and Feeney (1998)</xref>
        referred to this alteration of the TFR as a “tempo
effect” and proposed to not only standardize the total fertility rate by age, but to also
adjust the TFR for tempo effects. The basic idea of Bongaarts and Feeney is that
      </p>
      <p>
        Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 607
tempo effects are also a structural factor distorting the TFR when this indicator
is used to reflect the pure quantum of current fertility. An increase in the average
age at childbirth during the analyzed calendar year leads to a tempo effect-caused
reduction in the fertility rates, and a reduction in the average age at childbirth leads
to a tempo effect-caused increase in the fertility rates. Even though the existence
of such tempo effects in the period TFR is not questioned among demographers,
opinions as to the need for the tempo adjustment diverge in some respects.
Nonetheless, the additional use of the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate, which is
symbolised by TFR*, has more and more become the standard in demographic fertility
research in recent years. This can be seen in the increasing number of publications
in which fertility trends and differentials are analysed not only on the basis of the
conventional TFR, but also using the TFR*
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref22 ref23 ref29 ref35 ref39 ref43 ref44 ref45">(e.g. Lesthaeghe/Willems 1999; Philipov/
Kohler 2001; Goldstein et al. 2003; Sobotka 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Frejka/Sobotka
2008; Goldstein et al. 2009)</xref>
        . The TFR* is also a part of the standard repertoire of
demographic indices compiled in the “European Demographic Datasheet”, published
every two years by the Vienna Institute of Demography of the Austrian Academy of
Sciences (available on the Internet at http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/datasheet/index.
html).
      </p>
      <p>
        In most of the above mentioned publications, however, information on the
tempo-adjusted TFR* is missing for some European populations, including Germany.
The calculation of the tempo-adjusted TFR* requires the number of births being
separated not only by age of the mother but also by parity. This information was
not available for unified Germany and for former West Germany until 2009 because
of the statutory regulations. Prior to 2009, the parity was exclusively collected for
births of married mothers, with the birth order referring solely to children of the
current marriage (including pre-maritial children with the current husband).
Premaritial children with fathers other than the mother’s current husband, as well as
children from previous marriages, have not been considered and thus did not
enter official population statistics on parity. Only after the supplement of the
Population Statistics Act in 2009
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Bevölkerungsstatistikgesetz/Federal Law Gazette [BGBl]
2007)</xref>
        it was possible to record the so-called “biological birth order” independently
of the civil status of the mother for the whole of Germany
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">(see Statistisches
Bundesamt 2010)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>For the new Federal Länder (eastern Germany), the data of the former GDR are
available for the period prior to 1989. These include all births by parity and year of
birth of the mother as required for tempo adjustment. After reunification, however,
the birth statistics were carried out in accordance with the Federal Population
Statistics Act, and thus no official data on births by biological parity is available for
Eastern Germany for the period from 1989 to 2008.</p>
      <p>This article aims to provide estimates for the TFR* in Western and Eastern
Germany from the mid-1950s to the present, and hence to close – at least partly – one
of the gaps in international fertility research. In order to separate births by parity
as required for tempo adjustment of the TFR, we have used a variety of alternative
sources for West Germany as well as for Eastern Germany from 1990 on. These
contain estimates for the number or proportion of births by parity and age of the mother
for different periods, but they are based in some cases on very small population
samples with questionable representativity for the overall population. Moreover, in
view of the educational and family bias usually found in survey data, it cannot be
ruled out that some of these data sources lead to systematic distortions in
estimating parity and age at childbirth. Another inaccuracy results from the fact that the
data covers different age ranges of the reproductive life span. Although the
tempoadjusted fertility rates derived from these data are rather plausible when compared
to corresponding estimates for other countries with better data bases, it is
important to note that the estimates presented in this paper should not be seen as being
on the level of or equivalent to official statistics since they are based on different
kinds of data with different degrees of quality.</p>
      <p>The methods, and above all the data, on which our estimates of the TFR* for
Germany are based are described in detail in the next section. Then we present the
results for Western and Eastern Germany both in an intra-German as well as in an
international comparison. Finally, we summarise the most important findings and
discuss briefly interpretation-related and methodical aspects of the tempo-adjusted
total fertility rate. Note that the latter issue as well as a detailed analysis of the
fertility trends in Western and Eastern Germany are not the central purpose of this
paper. Nonetheless, the advantages and disadvantages of the tempo-adjusted TFR*
should be at least briefly summarised for those who have not followed the very
detailed discussion on tempo adjustment or those who have not studied it in detail.

      <title>Data and methods</title>
      <p>The conventional total fertility rate (TFR), which is published by the German Federal
Statistical Office on an annual basis, is calculated from the sum of the age-specific
fertility rates f(x), which are calculated by dividing the number of all births of women
aged x, B(x), by the number of women aged x, P(x):</p>

      <p>Since all indicators in this article refer to periods, we refrain from using an
additional index for the calendar year as far as possible for reasons of simplification.
The parameters α and ß represent the lowest and highest ages of women’s
reproductive life span, which are usually defined as 15 and 49 years. When totalling the
age-specific fertility rates, they all take on the same weight in the resulting TFR, so
that – as has already been mentioned in the introduction – the TFR primarily
constitutes an age-standardised fertility indicator.</p>
      <p>
        The basic idea behind tempo adjustment of the TFR is not only to standardize for
age but also for shifting effects which emerge in a calendar year when the average
age of women at childbirth changes during that calendar year
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref8 ref9">(see Bongaarts/Feeney
1998, 2006, 2010)</xref>
        . The direction of these changes can differ between parities. Since
      </p>
      <p>
        Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 609
the parities take on different weights in the overall TFR, the tempo adjustment of
the TFR according to the method of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Bongaarts and Feeney (1998)</xref>
        is performed on
a parity-specific basis. This requires separating the TFR in its parity-specific
components. The TFR for a parity i is calculated by summing up the corresponding
ageand parity-specific fertility rates f(x)i which differ from the age-specific fertility rates
in equation (1) in that the numerator does not contain all births of women aged x,
but only births of parity i, B(x)i:
      </p>
      <p>Note that these age- and parity-specific fertility rates f(x)i are no probabilities
(or any related measure) of the transition of a parity i to the next parity i+1. For this
purpose, the denominator of the rates should not include all x-year-old women,
but only those who actually belong to the female population at risk of giving birth
to a child of the i-th birth order (e.g. childless women in the calculation for parity
1). The age- and parity-specific fertility figures from equation (2) rather represent
the elements of a purely formal parity-specific decomposition of the TFR as can be
demonstrated easily. Subdividing the age-specific numbers of births B(x) in
equation (1) into the parities B(x)1 (first births), B(x)2 (second births), B(x)3 (third births)
and B(x)4+ (fourth and further children), leads to</p>

      <p>
        Tempo adjustment of the total fertility rate requires the number of births to be
subdivided by the age of the mothers on a parity-specific basis. The official
statistics of the GDR (East Germany) recorded all births by parity and year of birth of the
mother, and thus the tempo-adjusted TFR* for East Germany for the period 1955 to
1987 can be directly estimated from these data. For the new Federal Länder since
unification in 1990 (Eastern Germany) as well as for the territory of the former
Federal Republic of Germany (West respective Western Germany), official data on the
biological birth order are only available since 2009. In order to carry out the
parityspecific subdivision of the birth numbers necessary for the tempo adjustment of
the TFR for West respective Western Germany and Eastern Germany from 1990
onwards, it was necessary to use alternative data sources:
•
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Birg et al. (1990)</xref>
        provided an estimate of the parity-specific subdivision of
births in the Federal Republic of Germany for the years 1958 to 1985. The
estimates were based on the family biographies collected in the context of
the research project entitled “Labour market dynamics, family development
•

and generative conduct” in 1986, promoted by the DFG, which included 793
women and 783 men of the cohorts born in 1950 and 1955 from
Düsseldorf, Hannover, Bochum, Gelsenkirchen, Gronau, Ahaus, Vreden and Leer.
For each child of these respondents, the family biographies contain both the
actual birth order and the birth order information used by the West German
Statistical Office at that time. From the corresponding relative frequencies
(obtained for single ages of the mothers by means of linear regression
modelling), both the parity-specific births in marriage, and the non-marital births
which were recorded in official statistics on a non-parity-specific basis, were
transferred into an estimate of the biological parities by single age of the
mother. The authors used constant parity-specific subdivisions as obtained
from the project sample for both the children born in wedlock and those born
out of wedlock for every year from 1958 to 1985.</p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Kreyenfeld (2002)</xref>
        combined the official birth numbers for West respective
Western Germany from 1985 to 1995 with parity-specific frequencies
derived from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) similarly to
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Birg et al. (1990)</xref>
        .
However, only the non-marital births of the SOEP samples for West/Western
Germany and for foreigners (211 cases in total) were used for the subdivision
into the respective birth orders by means of a time-variable multinomial logit
model. As a consequence of this modelling procedure, the estimated
agespecific parity distributions differ slightly from year to year, in contrast to the
estimates of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Birg et al. (1990)</xref>
        . For marital births,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Kreyenfeld (2002)</xref>
        used the
official data on birth order of parents who were married to one another.
For the years 1995 to 1999 (Western Germany) and 1995 to 2000 (Eastern
Germany) we could use the data of the perinatal survey compiled and kindly
made available by Dr. Manfred Voigt (University of Greifswald). This survey
has been carried out since the 1980s directly in West German birth clinics
with the aim of improving the quality of perinatal medicine. Participation
in the survey, which was conducted by the Bundesländer themselves until
2000, has been obligatory for all clinics since 1995
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref33">(see Goerke/Lack 2000;
Kreyenfeld et al. 2010)</xref>
        . In contrast to official statistics, the perinatal survey
includes the birth order for all births a woman has ever had. Because of the
aim and the method of the survey, the perinatal survey exclusively contains
births which took place in clinics, what applies to the majority of all births
in Germany. Dr. Voigt was able to collect the perinatal survey data for all the
Federal Länder with the exception of Baden-Württemberg. Despite the
obligatory participation for all hospitals, the dataset for the years 1995 to 1997
contains only approx. 70 % of all 1,656,339 births registered in Germany
during these years. The percentages for the single calendar years are about
65 % in 1995, 78 % in 1996 and 66 % in 1997. Nevertheless, the availability of
the data for the Federal Länder enabled us to estimate parity-specific
proportions of births by the age of the mothers for Eastern and Western Germany
separately. For this purpose we used the absolute numbers without
additional smoothing. Since Berlin is included as one overall unit in the perinatal
survey – as in the official statistics from 2000 onwards – we excluded the
capital from our analysis.

      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Kreyenfeld et al. (2010)</xref>
        also used the data of the perinatal survey, which have
been compiled for the whole federal territory since the beginning of the 21st
Century by the German National Institute for Quality in Healthcare
(Bundesgeschäftsstelle Qualitätssicherung), to estimate parity-specific birth
numbers for the years from 2001 to 2008. But also these data are only virtually
complete from 2004 onwards. Some hospitals as well as entire Bundesländer
are missing in the years before, such as Hessen, Schleswig-Holstein and the
Saarland in 2001. The authors report that 4,978,381 births are recorded (and
useable) for the entire period from 2001 to 2008, corresponding to 89 % of
all births registered in Germany in these years. The shares in 2001, 2002 and
2003 are however only between 62 and 85 %.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Kreyenfeld et al. (2010)</xref>
        provide the parity-specific birth numbers derived from these data separately for
Eastern and Western Germany, with all of Berlin being allocated to Eastern
Germany. Like the data from the perinatal survey from 1995 to 1999
respective 2000 (see above), the data used by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Kreyenfeld et al. (2010)</xref>
        are based
solely on births which took place in hospitals. Using data from Germany’s
official health reporting (Gesundheitsberichterstattung des Bundes) and
statistics of the Association for Quality in Out-of-Hospital Births (Gesellschaft
für Qualität in der außerklinischen Geburtshilfe e.V. – QUAG), the authors
found that roughly one to two percent of all births took place outside
hospitals between 2001 and 2008. Although these figures include primarily
higherparity births, taking them into account only leads to negligible changes in the
parity-specific subdivision derived from the data of the perinatal survey
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(see
Kreyenfeld et al. 2010)</xref>
        .
• In order to close the gap arising from the above mentioned data sources
for Western Germany in the year 2000, we also analyzed the parity-specific
birth numbers of official statistics for the period 1998 to 2002. As has
already been described, these figures only include children born to parents
who are currently married to one another including their joint pre-marital
children. The quality of the TFR* estimated on the basis of these data mainly
depends on the extent of deviations between the average age at childbirth of
the women by the biological birth order and by the birth order in the current
marriage. Analysing the new official statistics for 2009 one asserts that this
extent mainly depends on the proportion of non-marital births
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">(Statistisches
Bundesamt 2010)</xref>
        . The difference between the age of the mother at the first
birth in the current marriage and the age of the mother at the first birth in her
life was 0.9 years in Western Germany in 2009 with the proportion of
extramarital first births being 36 %. The proportion of extra-marital births was
smaller among second and further births, namely between 17 % and 19 %,
and the corresponding age difference was only 0.3 years. The influence of

re-marriage was weak: 93 % of first births in the current marriage in 2009
were also the first births in the life of the mother. The concordance between
biological and marital birth order was even larger in second and further
births. Thus, since the proportion of births of unmarried women among all
live births in Western Germany in the years 1998 to 2002 was between 16 %
and 21 %
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">(Statistisches Bundesamt 2008, Tab. 1.1.1 to 1.1.3)</xref>
        , the information
on the marital birth order forms a relatively sound basis for estimating the
TFR*. The situation for Eastern Germany is different what prohibits using the
information from official statistics on the marital birth order: The proportion
of extra-marital births is much larger than in Western Germany. The
proportion of extra-marital births among first births was 74 % in 2009, and among
second and further births it was still far above 40 %. The difference between
the age at the first birth in the life of the woman and the age at the first birth in
the current marriage was 2.3 years. Between second and further births, the
age difference was 0.9 and 0.8 years, respectively. Furthermore, 20 % of the
women had already given birth before the first child in the current marriage
was born. The proportion of extra-marital births in the new Federal Länder
in the period between 1998 and 2002 was more than twice as high as in the
West, and it increased more rapidly: from 47 % in 1998 to 55 % in 2002.
      </p>
      <p>Table 1 summarizes the data sources used. As far as we know, these contain
the only data existing for the German population which provide the subdivision of
births into first births (parity 1), second births (parity 2), third births (parity 3) and
higher-order births (parity 4+) for the years 1955 to 2008. Since the case numbers
in the data sources used differ from the total number of births registered in Western
and Eastern Germany, the relative parity-specific subdivision of births, calculated
from the data sources, was applied to the total number of births in Western and
Eastern Germany as published by the statistical office. In formal terms, the age- and
parity-specific numbers of births B(x)i were estimated as follows:
with B(x) denoting the official overall number of births of x-year-old women, and
B(x)i</p>
      <p>B(x)  B' (x)i</p>
      <p>B' (x)
(10)
B‘(x)i and B‘(x), respectively, denoting the number of births of parity i of x-year-old
women as well as the corresponding total number of births included in the
respective data source. From these age- and parity-specific birth numbers and from the
numbers of living women aged 15 to 49 published by the statistical office, it was
possible to derive age- and parity-specific fertility rates for single ages of the
mothers which finally enabled us to estimate the parity-specific TFRi from equation (2) as
well as the parity-specific age at childbirth MABi from equation (8). The
tempo-adjusted total fertility rates TFR* were finally calculated as shown in equation (9). For
parities 1, 2 and 3 we used the tempo-adjusted TFR1*, TFR2* and TFR3* (calculated

      <p>In a first step, we subdivided the total number of births by the age of the mother for
Western and Eastern Germany published by the Statistical Office of Germany into
the parities on the basis of the parity distributions reconstructed from the various
data sources. From these parity-specific birth numbers, we decomposed the

ventional total fertility rate TFR – as described in the previous section – into parities
1, 2, 3 and 4+. The corresponding estimates for TFR1, TFR2, TFR3 and TFR4+ for
each calendar year can be found in Annex 1.</p>
      <p>Figure 1 shows the proportions of the parity-specific TFRi from 1958 to 2008
calculated from these data. Although the time trends of the parity-specific proportions
of the TFR reveal interesting differences between Western and Eastern Germany,
both parts of the country resemble each other in the fact that total fertility is mainly
determined by parities 1 and 2. All in all, first and second born children account for
70 % (from the end of the 1950s until the 1960s) to 80-85 % (since the 1970s in
Eastern Germany and since the 1980s in Western Germany) of the total number of live
births in the analyzed period. The proportions of parity 3 remain largely constant in
both Western and Eastern Germany, whilst births of fourth and higher order have
clearly become less significant since the 1970s in both parts of Germany and are of
only minor significance for total fertility. With regard to the tempo effect component
in the conventional TFR it is therefore of primary relevance how the average age
at childbirth of mothers of first and second children has changed in the analyzed
calendar years.</p>

        <p>Figures 2a to 2d present the annual changes in the average parity-specific age
at childbirth ri for the same observation period estimated from the age- and
parityspecific numbers of births. The values for parity 1 in Western Germany (black dots
in Fig. 2a) are to be found exclusively in the negative range until the beginning of
the 1970s. This means that the average age of women giving birth for the first time
is continuously decreased during these years. The situation is similar for the
average age at childbirth of parities 2 (shown in Fig. 2a by white triangles) and 3 (star
signature in Fig. 2c). Consequently, one can presume that tempo effects increased
the conventional TFR in the years of the baby boom. The changes in the average age
of the mothers of children of fourth and higher order (grey squares in Fig. 2c) show a
trend in contrast to parities 1 and 2 between the mid-1960s and the beginning of the
1970s. Because of the minor significance of parity 4+ for total fertility, this can only
result in a slight reduction of the tempo effects caused by parities 1, 2 and 3. From
the 1970s to the end of the 1990s, all parities show an almost permanent annual
increase in the average age at childbirth in Western Germany, albeit with varying
intensities. Above all in parity 1, the annual changes are more than 0.1 years in most
calendar years, with the maximum value of 0.26 being reached in 1983. Only in the
second half of the 1980s the values for r1 are around zero. Since the early 1990s,
there is a rise in the annual increase again, with an overall upward trend until the last
year of observation. The changes in the other parities are very similar over the entire
period. In the last years of the observation period, the annual change in the average
age at childbirth among parities 1 to 3 is between 0.15 and 0.20 years, so that the
TFR in Western Germany was influenced most by tempo effects in the 1970s and
early 1980s as well as since the early 1990s.</p>
        <p>In Eastern Germany, the values for ri of all parities fluctuate around zero from the
mid-1960s until the end of the 1980s (see Figs. 2b and 2d). The few exceptions relate
to parities 2, 3 and 4+ for a short time around 1970 and to parity 4+ at the end of the
1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s. All in all, the conventional TFR in Eastern
Germany should be more or less unaffected by tempo effects in this period. Since
unification, the trends have changed considerably. Unfortunately, for the years
between 1987 and 1996 the change in the average age at childbirth cannot be
estimated. However, the ri values derived for the years from 1996 to 2000 are – above
all for parities 1 and 2 – very high and much higher than in Western Germany. The
dashed interpolated lines in Figures 2b and 2d between 1987 and 1996 are included
to provide an impression of the massive changes which occurred in the ages at
childbirth among Eastern German mothers during the 1990s. These lines cannot be
used to estimate the ri values for the single years of this period, which could indeed
have been rather above the level of 1996 particularly in the first half of the 1990s.
However, they indicate that the extremely low TFR of Eastern Germany in this
period is caused to a considerable degree by tempo effects. From the beginning of the
20th century on the annual change in the average age at childbirth returns to a level
of around 0.2 years among parities 1 and 2, and is hence similar to the West German
level. The fluctuations are larger in parities 3 and 4+ with many of the single values
being around zero. However, as can be seen in Figure 1b, the changes in the ages at

the magnitude of the tempo effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The estimated annual changes in the parity-specific age at childbirth can be used
to adjust the TFRis for tempo effects according to the method proposed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Bongaarts and Feeney (1998)</xref>
          , and the resulting TFRi*s can then be cumulated to the
tempo-adjusted total fertility rate TFR* (the values for the TFRi* and the total TFR*
can be found for the single calendar years in Annex 2). Figure 3 shows the
corresponding estimates for Western Germany in comparison to the conventional TFR
(thin line). All in all, the estimates for the tempo-adjusted TFR* derived from the
various data sources (designated in Fig. 3 by different symbols) show a coherent
overall trend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since tempo adjustment with the method of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Bongaarts and Feeney (1998)</xref>
          can
generally lead to distinct annual fluctuations (and here additionally the combination
of different data sources), more robust results are obtained when averaging the
tempo-adjusted TFR* for three calendar years
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(see Goldstein et al. 2009)</xref>
          . The
resulting estimates for the TFR* of Western Germany can be found in Table 2a. The thick
black line in Fig. 3 represents the corresponding trend of the TFR* which reflects
the expectations that have already been outlined in connection with the trends in
the annual changes in parity-specific ages at childbirth. The TFR* is slightly below
the conventional TFR from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s because the age at
childbirth was falling at that time. This shows that the increase in the TFR at the
beginning of the baby boom in the 1950s was not only caused by the actual increase in
fertility but also to a slight degree by tempo effects. Similar results were shown for
instance for the USA
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Bongaarts/Feeney 1998)</xref>
          . At the end of the 1960s and at the
beginning of the 1970s, practically no differences can be found between the TFR
and the TFR*.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the early 1970s, the TFR* in Western Germany has been higher than the
conventional TFR. Whilst the TFR stagnated between 1.3 and 1.4 after the fertility
decline between the second half of the 1960s and the mid-1970s, the TFR* declined
less in the 1970s, and at the beginning of the 1980s the TFR* increased slightly to
about 1.7. The following years show a subsequent decrease in the TFR* that
persisted until 1990. Since then, the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate shows a more or less
continuous increase, reaching almost 1.7 in the last year of the observation period
(2008). All in all, although the TFR* is far from the replacement level of 2.1 children
per woman (upper dashed line in Fig. 3), it lies – in contrast to the conventional TFR
– clearly above the level of “lowest-low fertility”, which
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">Kohler et al. (2002)</xref>
          defined
as 1.3 children per woman (lower dashed line in Fig. 3).
        </p>
        <p>The differences between the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted TFR*
also correspond to the expectations for Eastern Germany outlined above on the
basis of the estimated annual changes in the average parity-specific age at childbirth.
In Figure 4 the corresponding estimates are, again displayed for the single years
and the trend in the three-year average of the TFR* (the respective values can be
found in Tab. 2b, as well as in Annex 2). It can be seen that tempo effects also led to
a slight increase in the total fertility rate during the 1950s in Eastern Germany which
is indicated by the somewhat lower values of the TFR* in comparison to the TFR.</p>

        <p>In the subsequent years until the mid-1980s, the annual changes in the mothers’
average age at childbirth were too small to lead to significant tempo effects.
Consequently, there are virtually no differences between the TFR and the TFR* in this
period. This changes in the last years prior to reunification during which the TFR* in
Eastern Germany rises in contrast to the decreasing TFR because of the increasing
age at childbirth, similar to what can be observed for Western Germany at the end
of the 1970s.</p>
        <p>Although we have only few estimates for the TFR* in the 1990s because of the
available data sources, these estimates illustrate to what degree the conventional
TFR (and the actual birth numbers) were affected by changes in the mean age at
childbirth in Eastern Germany. Whereas the conventional TFR was only 1.04 in 1997,
the estimated tempo-adjusted TFR* is 1.47. Equally to what has been done in

tempo adjusted TFR* ranged relatively constant around 1.5. Whether the increase

          A direct East-West comparison of fertility trends in Germany is presented in
Figure 5 according to the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted TFR*. The trends
in the conventional TFR can be found in Figure 5a and the trends in the
tempoadjusted TFR* can be found in Figure 5b. Interestingly, both variants of calculation
show the same phases in which the total fertility rate is higher in Eastern or Western
Germany. However, the differences in the tempo-adjusted TFR* in the two parts of
Germany are smaller in each phase (and since the second half of the 1990s almost
negligible).

          Besides this, the graphical West-East
comparison of the total fertility rate by means of the two calculation variants
provides one more important result: fertility had virtually disappeared at the end of the

conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted TFR*.</p>
        <p>Finally, Figure 6 (Western Germany) and Figure 7 (Eastern Germany) show the
trends in the TFR as well as in the TFR* in comparison to three other western and
eastern European populations for which the corresponding values could be
calculated from the Human Fertility Database (HFD) (the TFR* for these populations was
calculated analogously to our estimates for Western and Eastern Germany, i.e.
using the tempo-adjusted TFRi* for parities 1, 2 and 3 and the conventional TFRi for
the higher parities, presented by means of three-year moving averages). Equally to
what has been done in Figure 5, the graphs on the left-hand side show the
conventional TFR and the graphs on the right-hand side show the tempo-adjusted TFR*.
The figures are intended to enable us to evaluate the degree to which our estimates
of the TFR* for Western and Eastern Germany derived from data sources of
different quality can be regarded as plausible. It can be assumed that populations with
comparable demographic conditions and trends also show similar trends in tempo
effects. This, however, is a more intuitive concept rather than real empirical
evidence, More so if one takes into consideration that despite the common features

there are also historic and socio-structural differences between the two populations
under consideration.</p>
        <p>The trends of the conventional TFR in Western Germany, Austria, the Netherlands
and Sweden shown in Figure 6a reflect the already known fact that the West
German fertility level is located at the low end of the range in other western European
populations. Austria is comparable to Western Germany with regard to the level and
trend of the TFR since the 1980s (the HFD provides data for Austria only since this
time). In Sweden and in the Netherlands, the TFR has increased in the last ten years,
in contrast to the stagnation observed in Western Germany and Austria, where it
ranges around the level of 1.8 to 1.9 in most recent years. Figure 6b reveals that
the estimates for the TFR* of Western Germany are also close to the
corresponding values of Austria, for which age- and parity-specific birth numbers of the total
population are published directly by the national statistical office (Statistik Austria).
This finding holds for the mid-1990s onwards. In the years before, at around 1990,
the Austrian TFR* shows a strong fluctuation which is not visible in the conventional
TFR. All in all, the estimates for the TFR* of Western Germany fit well and plausible
into the picture of the Western European populations. Only in the 1980s and early
1990s the estimates for the TFR* seem somewhat too low. An interesting result is
that in the most recent years the differences in the total fertility rate between
Western Germany and Austria, on the one hand, and Sweden and the Netherlands, on the
other, are much smaller when the TFR is tempo adjusted.</p>
        <p>Figure 7 also includes one population which seems suitable for comparison with
Eastern Germany in order to judge the plausibility of our tempo-adjusted estimates.
Roughly since 1980, Slovenia shows a similar trend in the conventional TFR
compared to that of Eastern Germany. In the 1990s, however, both differ when no
fertility changes comparable to those in Eastern Germany occurred in Slovenia (see
Fig. 7a). The two other populations, from the Czech and Slovak Republics, exhibit a
much higher TFR until the mid-1990s, but show similar changes in the fertility level
as the East German population in the first half of the 1990s (albeit without recovery
after the baby bust). The comparison of the estimates for the East German
tempoadjusted TFR* with the corresponding figures for the three other populations in
Figure 7b also shows that the estimates for Eastern Germany seem highly plausible.</p>

There are only minor differences in comparison to the values for Slovenia in the
1980s as well as since the beginning of the 21st century. During the 1990s, the much
less pronounced fertility reduction shown by the TFR* in comparison to the
conventional TFR fits the examples of the Czech and Slovak Republics very well. Both
experienced declines in the conventional TFR similar to those occurring in Eastern
Germany during this period.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>As already mentioned in the introduction, the main aim of the work for this article
was the compilation of a time series of estimates for the tempo-adjusted total
fertility rate in Western and Eastern Germany. To achieve this, we used a variety of
data sources from which age- and parity-specific birth numbers could be derived to
serve as basis for estimating the tempo-adjusted TFR*. It was possible to construct
a complete time series for Western Germany for the years from 1960 to 2007. For
Eastern Germany, however, it was not possible to provide such a complete time
series. We were able to present estimates (by means of three year averages) for
the years 1956 to 1986 and for 1997 to 2007 (the estimates for single calendar years
cover the years 1959-2008 for Western Germany and the years 1955-1987 as well as
1996-2008 for Eastern Germany).</p>
      <p>
        Although the idea behind Bongaarts and Feeney’s tempo approach (not only for
fertility but also for all other demographic events) as well as the arguments of the
critics are described in
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">Luy (2010)</xref>
        , we should add a few remarks with regard to the
interpretation and correct attribution of the tempo-adjusted time series presented
in this paper. Particularly the question of the interpretation of the tempo-adjusted
total fertility rate is not easy to answer, and has already led to a number of
misunderstandings in the corresponding demographic literature. The advantage of the
conventional TFR is its clear definition and interpretation as the sum of the
age-specific fertility rates observed in a given calendar year. In order to explain the meaning
of the TFR* as intended by Bongaarts and Feeney, it is necessary to describe this
indicator in a broader context.
      </p>
      <p>Independent of the calculation variant (conventional or tempo-adjusted), the aim
of the calculation of the total fertility rate for a period is to provide a cross-sectional
measure of a population’s current fertility. Therefore, only women who are aged
between 15 and 49 in the calendar year under observation, i.e. women hence
belonging to 35 different cohorts, are considered. The current fertility of these women
is influenced to differing degrees by the current political and societal framework
and their own reproduction histories. In order to obtain a better understanding of a
period measure, one might imagine that the current age-specific fertility conditions
are used to construct a scenario for a hypothetical population. All the women of
this hypothetical population would realise precisely the given age-specific fertility
at any time. In such a scenario, all female cohorts would have the same final
average number of children, which equals the average number of children of all women
aged between 15 and 49 living in each calendar year. Demographers refer to such a
scenario as a “stable population”.</p>
      <p>A real population whose current fertility is to be characterised by the total
fertility rate is naturally never stable. Consequently, period indicators derived in the logic
of the stable population always have to be regarded as purely hypothetical. The
idea behind Bongaarts and Feeney’s tempo approach is based on the fact that the
number of births and the number of women aged between 15 to 49 living in a
specific calendar year do not originate from a stable population. Imagine a rather simple
exemplary case in which each woman has exactly one child, gives birth at exactly
the same age, and that the times of the births are evenly distributed over the year. In
this scenario, the sum of the age-specific fertility rates as an indicator of the current
fertility would also be exactly one child per woman in any given calendar year. If,
however, the age at which the women give birth to their child continually increases
(so that a change in birth timing takes place, but not in birth quantum), the cohorts
of women being in reproductive ages in a calendar year would have their children
over a longer period than one year. In this case, all women living in a specific
calendar year would still realise one birth during their lives, but the average value derived
from the age-specific fertility rates for this year would be lower than one.</p>
      <p>Bongaarts and Feeneys’ approach for characterising the fertility of a specific
calendar year takes into account that the current fertility of a real population does not
originate from a situation in which the age at childbirth of all cohorts currently living
remains unchanged. The idea is hence to adjust the time frames of the birth times
of the newborns and of the cohorts of mothers (i.e. the numerators and
denominators of the age-specific fertility rates) to capture the current birth quantum of the
currently living women. The adjustment relates exclusively to the above described
expansion effect of the birth period resulting from the increase in the age at
childbirth, assuming that the fertility quantum remains unchanged despite the age shift
(analogously, when the age at childbirth declines, the reduction effect of the shorter
childbirth period would be adjusted for).</p>
      <p>
        In a stable population, the total fertility rate of a calendar year can be regarded
as the average number of children born during the life course of all female cohorts
currently living. In these terms, the conventional period TFR (i.e. the observed
total fertility rate of a specific calendar year) can also be interpreted as the average
number of children born by the female cohorts living at the same time in the
hypothetical population in the course of their reproductive life span. The prerequisite is
that these female cohorts realise exactly the age-specific fertility rates observed in
the period, i.e. without changes in birth quantum and birth timing. The
tempo-adjusted TFR* is to be equivalently interpreted as the average number of children who
are born to the hypothetical female cohorts living at the same time in the course of
their reproductive life span if these female cohorts realise the birth quantum of the
period observed, defined by the age-specific fertility rates, but with changes in birth
timing. When we reduce the interpretation to the single hypothetical cohort usually
used, then the TFR* does not reflect the age-specific fertility rates observed in the
period, but the age-specific fertility rates adjusted for changes in the birth timing
during the observed year
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(see also Lesthaeghe/Willems 1999)</xref>
        .

        Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 627
Besides the aspects of birth quantum and birth timing, the age distribution of the
parity-specific fertility rates by the age of the women is also relevant with regard
to the tempo adjustment according to the Bongaarts and Feeney formula used in
this article. It becomes evident from equation (6) that the tempo adjustment is
exclusively based on the change in the average age at childbirth of the parities. Thus,
the Bongaarts and Feeney formula implies that the distribution of the age-specific
fertility rates remains constant when shifting with age. Most of the methodical
critics of tempo adjustment focus on this feature of the Bongaarts and Feeney method
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29 ref39 ref49 ref50 ref51">(see e.g. van Imhoff/Keilman 2000; Kohler/Philipov 2001; van Imhoff 2001; Yi/Land
2001)</xref>
        . In real populations, the changes in the average age at childbirth are indeed
accompanied by variance changes which also exert an influence on the number of
children born in a calendar year. Thus, the increase in the average age at childbirth
can be caused by both an increase in age-specific fertility in the higher reproductive
age and by a fall in the fertility rates among younger women (in the first case, the
fertility quantum would increase in the long term; in the latter it would fall).
Consequently, very different changes in the age distribution of the parity-specific fertility
rates can lead to identical changes in the average age at childbirth, and hence to an
identical tempo adjustment with the Bongaarts and Feeney formula. Such cases are
not rare and can also be observed in the German population during the calendar
years analysed in this paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Theoretically it is possible to extend the tempo adjustment to include the effect
of changes in the age distribution of the parity-specific fertility rates as proposed
by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Kohler and Philipov (2001)</xref>
        . In practice, however, feasibility reaches its limit here
in most cases because of the detailed nature of the data required. It is therefore
important to note that the tempo adjustment with the Bongaarts and Feeney
formula is merely an approximation of the intended adjustment of the total fertility
rate
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(see Luy 2010 for details)</xref>
        . However, the criticism of the non-consideration of
variance effects can be countered by two arguments: The first concerns the relative
significance of changes in the average age at childbirth and in the age distribution
of the age-specific fertility rates for the numbers of births occurring in a specific
calendar year. As
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Dinkel (1989)</xref>
        has shown by simulations, changes in the average
age at childbirth have a much larger impact on the birth numbers than changes in
the variance of the fertility distribution. It is not likely that the non-consideration of
variance changes leading to an incorrect direction of the tempo adjustment with
the Bongaarts and Feeney formula occurs frequently, albeit its absolute extent can
indeed be distorted. The second argument is that the conventional TFR does not
at all account for changes in birth timing. Consequently, also
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Kohler and Philipov
(2001)</xref>
        concluded that an adjustment of the total fertility rate with the Bongaarts and
Feeney formula is better for the analysis of period fertility than completely
excluding tempo adjustment.
      </p>
      <p>This discussion, however, is not aimed to ascertain which measure is better
suited to characterise period fertility. One should not forget that the TFR and the
TFR* are both pure period indicators, and hence both solely reflect hypothetical
average birth numbers. In case of the conventional TFR, this hypothetical average
birth number is based on the observed fertility rates of a calendar year, and in the
case of the tempo-adjusted TFR* on the estimated birth quantum of the women
living in this calendar year. The latter cannot be measured, but only modelled, which
is certainly a weakness of the TFR* compared to the conventional total fertility rate.
Ultimately, the two indicators are based on somewhat different reference
quantities. For the analysis of period fertility it is thus most informative to use them
parallel and supplementing one another, as it was done in all the papers listed in the
introduction.</p>
      <p>Regarding the empirical results presented in this article, it can be stated that
the two fertility indicators – the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted TFR* –
identify different phases in fertility trends in Western and Eastern Germany. In both
parts of the country, the TFR* is lower than the TFR until the end of the 1960s. This
is a consequence of the decline in the average age at childbirth, in particular with
regard to the first and second births. The age of the women at the birth of their
children rises markedly in Western Germany in the 1970s and 1980s. As a consequence,
the tempo-adjusted TFR* is on average almost 0.18 higher than the conventional
TFR during the years from 1971 to 1987. In the former GDR, by contrast, the age at
childbirth remained relatively constant in this period, so that the tempo-adjusted
TFR* and the conventional TFR do not differ significantly. Since the beginning of the
1990s, the average age at childbirth of Western German women rises once more
after a brief phase of relative stability. This trend causes an increasing deviation
between the estimated TFR* and the conventional TFR in Western Germany. In Eastern
Germany, we can only presume that the difference between the two indicators was
particularly large in the first half of the 1990s. This is suggested by several
indicators pointing towards a rapid increase in the age at childbirth of Eastern German
mothers. An idea of the extent of this difference is provided by the estimates for
the second half of the 1990s. The difference between the tempo-adjusted TFR* and
the conventional TFR in the years 1997-1999 is between 0.37 and 0.43. In the years
from 2000 to 2007, the TFR* in Eastern Germany is on average 0.28 higher than the
conventional TFR.</p>
      <p>Hence, the combined picture of the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted
TFR* provides interesting results with regard to the trends in period fertility in
Western and Eastern Germany, which were not analysed in detail in this paper. This
applies above all to the West-East differences in the overall trend and the massive
tempo effects in Eastern Germany during the 1990s. Since 2009 it is possible to
analyse level and trends of fertility in Germany with tempo-adjusted fertility rates
on the basis of parity-specific data for all births from official statistics. For the period
prior to this we have compiled the best possible estimates. Even if these estimates
are not comparable with the data of official statistics in qualitative terms, the data
presented in this paper enables researchers to include the population of Western
and Eastern Germany in future research on international trends in tempo-adjusted
period fertility.</p>
