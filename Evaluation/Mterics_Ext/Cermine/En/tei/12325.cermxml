      <p>j Abstract Introduction Child
psychiatric diagnoses are generally
based on a clinical examination
and not on standardized
questionnaires. The present study
assessed whether symptom
diagnostics based on clinical records
facilitates the use of
non-standardized clinical material for
research. Method Six hundred and
eighty-five children, referred to a
third level child psychiatric centre
in the Netherlands, were, after
extensive multidisciplinary
examination, classified according to the
multi-axial classification scheme
for psychiatric disorders in
childhood and adolescence
(MAC-ICD9). By two raters 44 behavioural
symptoms were scored based on
the clinical records of these
children. Interrater agreement on
symptoms in 50 records was
performed. Principal components
analysis on symptom scores of all
children was performed; factor
scores were related with
MACICD-9 classifications. Results
Interrater reliability for
behavioural symptoms was excellent
(j = 0.88). Many children with
psychiatric problems suffer from a
large number of behavioural
symptoms. Factor scores of the
symptoms revealed recognizable
and well interpretable entities and
indicated overlap in
symptomatology and comorbidity.
Conclusion A symptom-based diagnostic
approach based on extensive
clinical patient files may provide a
special dimension to improve the
reliability of psychiatric
classification.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        The aim of psychiatric classification is to facilitate
communication among medical professionals,
caregivers, educational experts, and people involved in a
patient’s treatment as well as use in scientific research
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref18">1, 18</xref>
        ]. The classification of a patient’s disorder is based
on thorough clinical investigation which increasingly
relies on structured diagnostic interviews and
questionnaires. The use of structured diagnostic interviews
can improve reliability and consistency of
classification. The advantage of questionnaires is
standardization [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref18">16, 18</xref>
        ]. However questionnaires often focus on
specific types of disturbances, such as anxiety,
depression, or bipolar diseases. Another objection EC
encountered in the use of questionnaires is that often P
A
7
multiple data sources are used, and each assessor of the 62
child’s behaviour has different information about the
child and knowledge of child psychiatry [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18">17, 18</xref>
        ]. The
use of clinical classifications also has an inherent
disadvantage due to variable reliability, particularly in
regard to disorders, where interrater reliability varies
from moderate to excellent: for example reliability is
good to excellent for ADHD and separation anxiety, fair
for generalized anxiety and obsessive compulsive
disorder (OCD) and conduct disorder (CD) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref21 ref24">16, 21, 24</xref>
        ].
This variability in reliability can partially be explained
by the overlap of symptomatology in diverging clinical
psychiatric syndromes and by comorbidity [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref21 ref23 ref3 ref6 ref9">2, 3, 6, 9,
21, 23</xref>
        ]. In classification, this may lead to differences of
interpretation, for example in the principle diagnosis.
To evaluate the suitability of clinical material for use in
research we explored whether symptom scoring on the
basis of non-standardized clinical material is feasible
and may be interpreted in terms of clinical diagnosis. In
research the addition of dimensional elements in
classification systems is becoming progressively more
important [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref13 ref18 ref19 ref4">4, 12, 13, 18, 19</xref>
        ]. Dimensional elements may
help to distinguish differences in individual disorder
severity and clinically significant features subsumed by
other disorders [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref14 ref4">4, 11, 14</xref>
        ]. They also can help
determine comorbidity and overlap of symptomatology.
      </p>
      <p>Our study was conducted in the framework of a
larger study on neurobehavioral relationships in
children with psychiatric morbidity. Its aim was to
investigate whether it is possible to improve insight
into the structure and value of child psychiatric
classifications with the help of additional scoring of
symptoms noted in the clinical record. To this end we
assessed the clinical records of 705 children who were
referred to a centre for child and adolescent
psychiatry in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The following research questions were
investigated:
1. Is it possible to score psychiatric symptoms
reliably on the basis of carefully recorded, but
nonstandardized clinical material?
2. Assuming this were possible, does principal
components analysis of the symptoms reveal the
presence of clinically recognizable and reliably
interpretable entities?</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>j Participants
The study population consisted of 705 children who
between 1984 and 1999 had been referred to
‘‘Fornhese’’, a third-level regional diagnosis and
treatment centre for children with psychiatric
problems and their families. Fornhese is a subsidiary of the
psychiatric centre ‘‘Symfora Group’’ in Amersfoort,
the Netherlands. Table 1 presents the significant
demographic characteristics of the children.
Approximately three quarters of them were boys (73%). The
majority (98%) were aged between 4 and 12 years old,
averaging 9.0 years (SD ±2.05). Thirty-nine percent
were in special education programs.
j Procedure
All children were examined according to standard
diagnostic procedures by a team consisting of a child
psychiatrist (MdJ), a psychologist/physical therapist
(JMP), a family therapist, a psychotherapist, and a
play therapist, each of whom was assigned specific
tasks. The standard diagnostic program consisted of
history taking, including developmental history and a
parental report, family diagnostics, child psychiatric
and neuropsychiatric examination, and the gathering
of relevant prior diagnostic data and school
information. Members of the diagnostic team were careful
to assess the children with an open mind and to avoid
jumping to clinical conclusions. This means that signs
and symptoms were recorded even if they do not
belong primarily to a specific psychiatric disorder.</p>
      <p>
        If indicated, the standard diagnostic program was
supplemented with other examinations, such as
psychodiagnostic assessments, specific educational
assessments, occupational therapeutic assessments,
supplementary medical examinations. All
examinations were recorded in detail in written form. The
final diagnoses were established by consensus in a
team conference on the basis of all collected
information. This resulted in a classification according to
MAC-ICD-9 (multi-axial classification scheme for
psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref7">7, 20</xref>
        ]), the child psychiatric adaptation of the ICD-9
(International Classification of Diseases, version 9,
World Health Organization [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        ]). For the
classification of dyslexia as a clinical psychiatric syndrome, the
DSM-IV (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental
disorders, American Psychiatric Association [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]) was
used, since the MAC-ICD-9 does not classify this as a
clinical psychiatric syndrome on Axis I, but as a
specific developmental disorder on Axis II. The
diagnostic assessment procedure for children referred
for dyslexia was identical to that of the other children.
      </p>
      <p>
        To assess child psychiatric symptoms, we
developed a behavioural symptom list on the basis of the
most distinct criteria for each MAC-ICD-9 clinical
aCohen’s kappa could not be calculated. One assessor scored exclusively ‘0’, the other scored ‘1’ once
bCohen’s kappa could not be calculated. Both assessors scored exclusively ‘0’
n
psychiatric syndrome (Axis I), to which we added
specific (Axis II) developmental disorders (e.g.,
developmental dyslexia, motor retardation). This list
consisted of 44 items (Table 2), presented in random
order. Two researchers (TH and MS), who were blind
to the child’s final diagnostic description and clinical
classification and whose information about each child
was restricted to the information in the clinical
record, scored each item on a three-point scale (‘‘not
applicable’’, ‘‘somewhat or sometimes applicable’’,
‘‘distinctly or often applicable’’) on the basis of
diagnostic data from patient files. Six hundred and
eighty-five files could be assessed in this way; the
other 20 files were no longer available. To determine
interrater reliability of symptom scores, 50 of total
685 files were selected at random and scored by both
researchers separately.
j Statistical analysis
Interrater reliability for the 44 items of the symptom
list was, due to their ordinal level of measurement,
determined by square-weighted Cohen’s kappa [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Kappa’s were calculated by the statistical package
AGREE, version 7.002, and were interpreted
according to Landis and Koch [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        The interrelationships of the symptoms were
investigated by principal components analysis (PCA)
with Varimax-rotation. The median standardized
factor score of each symptom was compared to the
MAC-ICD-9 clinical psychiatric syndromes, using the
Kruskal–Wallis test. This non-parametric test was
chosen since the non-homogeneity of the variances
did not allow for a parametric test. Post hoc
comparisons were made by using the method described by
Siegel and Castellan [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>PCA and Kruskal–Wallis test were performed by
use of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS), version 12.1. Results were considered
statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>j Prevalence of clinical psychiatric syndromes
The prevalence of the clinical psychiatric syndromes
in the study population (n = 685), listed MAC-ICD-9
order, was:
• Autistic disorders (n = 120; 18%); in this context
autistic disorders includes all disorders in the
autism spectrum
• Neurotic disorders (n = 54; 8%)
• Adjustment disorders (n = 89; 13%)
• Disturbance of emotions specific to childhood and</p>
      <p>adolescence (n = 210; 31%)
• Hyperkinetic disorders (n = 54; 8%)
• Disturbance of conduct not elsewhere classified</p>
      <p>(n = 76; 11%), henceforth referred to as CDs
• Special symptoms or syndromes not elsewhere
classified (tics, stuttering, disorders of eating,
etcetera) (n = 30; 4%)
• Dyslexia (n = 44; 6%); not mentioned as
psychiatric syndrome on Axis I in the MAC-ICD-9, but as a
specific disorder in development on Axis II
• No psychiatric diagnosis (n = 8; 1%); no child
psychiatric problems were found after child
psychiatric assessment.
j Prevalence of symptoms
The prevalence of each symptom is shown in Table 2.</p>
      <p>In 20% of children, eight or fewer symptoms were
identified, in 33%, nine to 12 symptoms, in 30%, 13 to
16 symptoms, in 16%, 17 or more symptoms.
j Interrater reliability of symptom scoring
The mean kappa of items in the psychiatric symptom
list was 0.88 (Table 2). Interrater reliability was
very good’ for 32 items (j &gt; 0.80), good’ for six
items (0.66 &lt; j £ 0.80) and moderate’ for one item
(hypoactivity; j = 0.54). The Cohen’s kappa for five
infrequent symptoms could not be determined, but
both assessors had high levels of agreement; on two of
the five items both assessors scored 0’, for three
items, one assessor consistently scored 0’, the other
scored 1’ once.
j Principal component analysis of the symptoms
Six symptoms which were scored in less than 2% of
the children were not included in PCA: brief
depressive reaction’, socialised disturbance of
conduct’, mild or transient disturbance of conduct’,
elective mutism’, trichotillomania’ and compulsive
CDs’.</p>
      <p>PCA was performed for the remaining 38
symptoms in 677 subjects (in eight subjects one or more
symptoms was missing). PCA produced 12
Eigenvalues greater than unity. The scree-plot however
indicated that the elbow of the plot, which separates
the most important factors, was situated after six
factors. Therefore, and for reasons of interpretation,
we chose the six-factor solution. The six factors
combined explained 37.4% of the total variance.

less than 0.3 on each of the six extracted factors:
stuttering’ and adjustment reaction with
predominant disturbance of other emotions as anxiety, fear or
worry’. Six items had factor loadings greater than 0.3
on two factors.</p>
      <p>The following six factors were extracted: (1) a
factor, we call autistic symptoms, isolated the
symptoms of the autistic disorders except psychosis’. Also
isolated were stereotyped repetitive movements’,
excessive reactions on environmental stimuli’ and
developmental speech/language disorders’. (2) On the
second factor, called disorders in attention, activity
and conduct, three symptoms of hyperkinetic
disorders and three symptoms of CDs had high loadings.
(3) The factor emotional disabilities had high loadings
of three items of disturbance of emotions specific to
childhood and adolescents, plus negativism’, lasting
depression’, hypoactivity’ and bodily complaints’.
(4) The factor anxiety and OCD isolated four items of
neurotic disorders with the addition of psychosis’
and tics’. (5) The factor learning disabilities with
deficits in attention and motor control had high
loadings for dyslexia and spelling disorder’,
arithmetical disorder’ and motor retardation’. (6) The
factor, called functional disorders, isolated four items
of the syndromes Not Otherwise Specified.

      <p>Children classified as having an autistic disorder
according to MAC-ICD-9 scored significantly higher
on factor one, autistic symptoms, than children with

having a hyperkinetic disorder or as having a CD
according to MAC-ICD-9 scored significantly higher
on factor two, disorders in attention, activity, and
conduct, than children with most other MAC-ICD-9
syndromes. The difference was substantially greater
for hyperkinetic disorders than for CDs. Children
with dyslexia and those with the clinical psychiatric
syndrome hyperkinetic disorders scored significantly
higher on factor five, learning disabilities with deficits
in attention and motor control, than children with
other MAC-ICD-9 clinical psychiatric syndromes. The
relationship between the other three factor scores and
MAC-ICD-9 classifications was less specific.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study indicates that it is possible to score
psychiatric symptoms reliably from clinical
material collected in a non-standardized way. Principal
components analysis of the symptoms yielded well
interpretable, clinically recognizable entities with
reasonable correspondences to the clinical psychiatric
syndromes. It also illustrated the existence of a
substantial amount of overlap in symptomatology and
comorbidity.
j Methodological considerations
It might be considered a weak point that we used the
MAC-ICD-9 instead of more recently developed
classification systems such as the DSM-IV for the
classification of clinical syndromes. The use of this
older system is due to the fact that the project started
in 1984. We considered continued use of the
MACICD-9 classification system more reliable than a
midcourse change in the classification system, since
conversion of the oldest data to another system would
have entailed the loss of information. An additional
argument to continue with the MAC-ICD-9 was that
in our opinion more recent systems initially paid less
attention to the child’s developmental and
environmental variables does than the MAC-ICD-9.</p>
      <p>MAC-ICD-9 was also used to generate the list of
the most prevalent child psychiatric symptoms. The
use of the most prevalent symptoms implies that the
list is not profuse. This underscores the notion that
the present symptom list cannot replace clinical
diagnostics and classification. In addition, it should
be noted that rarely occurring symptoms such as
trichotillomania’, elective mutism’, gambling and
stealing’, and disturbance of social conduct’ were not
included in PCA.</p>
      <p>It is also noteworthy that symptoms belonging to
the MAC-ICD-9 clinical syndrome of adjustment
disorders were scored infrequently. Possibly the
patient files did not provide sufficient information about
temporary aspects of the adjustment disorder. The
most likely explanation is that the signs of
maladjustment were interpreted as mild signs of other
disorders, such as emotional disorder.</p>
      <p>A limitation of the PCA based on symptoms noted
in clinical records is that any bias in the clinically
collected information is by definition transferred to
the relevant clinical symptom association. In other
words, a PCA based on symptoms noted in clinical
records cannot be compared to PCA based on
indications derived from standardized and unbiased
questionnaires.</p>
      <p>Symptom diagnostics, like other dimensional
approaches, have the limitation that symptoms only
are a part of the expression of the childhood
psychopathology, so it can never replace a classification
system in which all aspects of development, somatic
conditions, family history and genetics are taken into
account.</p>
      <p>
        The strength of the present study is the study
population, which was not a selected university
hospital population, but consisted of a large number of
children referred to a regional centre for child
psychiatry. This implies that our population can be
considered a reliable representation of the general
psychiatric population. In addition, our data were not
based on behavioural information collected by means
of questionnaires, but on extensive child psychiatric
diagnostics, including an interview. Hartman et al.
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] demonstrated that information based on a
psychiatric interview is considerably more reliable than
that those based on questionnaires.
j Practical implications
Symptom diagnostics provide information about the
presence or absence of psychopathology and about
the degree to which psychopathology manifests itself
in the individual patient. Our study indicated that
many children with psychiatric problems suffer from
a large number of symptoms. This may explain why
diagnostics at the clinical classification level is
difficult and relatively unreliable. It also reflects the
comorbid nature of childhood psychiatric disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data on the relationships between the
MACICD-9 clinical syndromes and the symptom based
factor scores nicely illustrated two phenomena which
complicate diagnostics in children with psychiatric
morbidity, i.e. criterion overlap (the fact that similar
symptoms are used for the classification of
different syndromes) and comorbidity. For example, our
findings indicated that children with hyperkinetic
disorders often had problems in motor control in
combination with learning disabilities. The
combination of hyperkinetic disorder and problems in
motor control is well known and referred to in the
literature as deficits in attention, motor control, and
perception (DAMP [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ]).
      </p>
      <p>
        The results also demonstrated that factor scores
autistic symptoms (factor 1), disorders in attention,
activity and conduct (factor 2) and learning
disabilities with deficits in attention and motor control (factor
5) corresponded strongly to their related clinical
psychiatric syndromes. Factor scores emotional
disabilities (factor 3), anxiety and obsessive compulsive
disorders (factor 4), and functional disorders (factor 6)
were less specific for a MAC-ICD-9 classification. One
possible explanation for this finding is that the
MACICD-9 classification system, from which all of the
symptoms are derived, includes many mixed
disorders hallmarked by comorbidity [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ]. The substantial
degree of criterion overlap, the fact that clinical
psychiatric syndromes are insufficiently discriminating,
and the presence of comorbidity we consider to be
important contributing factors to the variability in
interrater reliability in child psychiatric classification.
Factors such as referral bias and specific features of
the clinician (i.e. education level, experience, work
setting) and the variance in sources of information
about the child also play a part in this process. The
variability in interrater reliability for the classification
of different clinical psychiatric syndromes is cause
for concern, particularly since governmental and
institutional policies are increasingly based on these
classifications.
j Concluding remarks
The present study indicated that diagnostic material,
as acquired by an extensive, systematic diagnostic
process, and elaborately documented in patient files,
is suitable for evaluation by third party assessors and
therefore for scientific research. Scoring of
problematic behaviour as symptoms on the basis of diagnostic
material has turned out to be possible with a high
level of reliability. Symptom diagnostics based on
extensively documented patient files of careful, but
non-standardized child psychiatric assessments
support the reliability of classification by addition of a
special dimension to classification. Hence our study
suggests that for child psychiatric research, this
symptom-based dimensional diagnostic approach
is a strengthening tool. The dimensional approach
highlights the overlap in symptomatology and of
comorbidity and facilitates insight in the type and
severity of individual psychopathology, and thereby
on the impact on the child’s social environment. In
turn, improved insight has implications for treatment.
However, symptom diagnostics cannot replace
clinical diagnostics in child psychiatry.
