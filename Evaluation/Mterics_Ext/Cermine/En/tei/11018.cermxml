"Groupwork" is a particular form of work organisation typical for German
factories that has been strongly influenced by union views. Management and
trade unions present it as a radical innovation that calls into question the
principles of the former Taylorist organisation on the one hand, and the
meaning of production workers' work on the other hand. The workers I
interviewed at Volkswagen in Hannover actually develop a different analysis of
the new work organisation and of its outcome. Their original understanding
invalidates the appellation of "groupwork" itself. They strictly separate the
group: singular form of first-line supervision based on a new normative
framework, and the work: the meaning of which has remained unchanged
despite the implementation of the new organisation.</p>

unverändert bleibt).</p>

Being interested in workers and their work in Germany nowadays, it is actually
almost impossible to visit factories, and have discussions with managers or
union representatives without mentioning "groupwork" (Gruppenarbeit).
"Groupwork", as it is implemented in Germany neither fits Japanese teamwork
[Womack et al., 1990] nor a group of workers assembling an entire vehicle as in
Volvo's plant in Uddevalla [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Sandberg, 1995</xref>
            ], it is a particular form of work
organisation, typical for German factories, that calls into question the principles
of the former Taylorist organisation [Durand et al., 1999].
          </p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-11-1-10">
          <title>According to the German industrial relations system [Thelen, 1991] the implementation of "groupwork" usually takes the form of a plant agreement (Betriebsvereinbarung) between management and works council, and aims at enhancing firm's competitiveness as well as improving work conditions.</title>
          <p>
            From Automation to "Groupwork"
In the 1970s and the 1980s, technology and automation were the core of
management policies regarding rationalisation and competitiveness.
Management was aiming at replacing workforce through machines at every
possible place on the shopfloor. At that time, "groupwork" was a union word
only. It was part of the considerations arising from the project called
"humanisation of work" (Humanisierung der Arbeit) initiated by the federal State
in 1974. "Groupwork" was far from notions such as profitability and
competitiveness [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">IG Metall, 1980</xref>
            ;
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">Leminisky, 1980</xref>
            ]. It was an alternative
proposal for better working conditions, through re-qualification of assembly line
work, tasks enrichment and greater workers' autonomy. It gave rise to some
experiences which were rapidly abandoned, as in the motor assembly
department at Volkswagen in Wolfsburg [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Granel, 1980</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>In 1990, the publication of the MIT study on world-wide car industry
[Womack et al., op. cit.] induced a major turn in western car manufacturers
rationalisation's strategy. This study strongly contributed to bring to light the
"Japanese model" and to diffuse teamwork. The automation strategy was
reaching its limits. Facing the emergence of very efficient Japanese competitors
organised in a completely different way regarding work, production or supplier
relations, western car assemblers started to re-think their rationalisation policy,
inspired by the Japanese success.</p>
          <p>
            At the beginning of the 1990s, German managers turned to the works
councils and the IG Metall1 to negotiate plant agreements on "groupwork",
considering now "groupwork" as a key element to restore competitiveness. By
doing this, they appropriated a term they have been rejecting before, and they
associated "groupwork" with rationalisation and profitability. As a former
alternative proposal to management projects, "groupwork" became the core of
management initiatives regarding work organisation. One observes a reversed
situation. Management now seeks to mobilise workers' know-how, experience
and creativity to enhance firms' competitiveness. "Groupwork" marks "workers'
come back" in management words and strategies. It also signals the collusion
(and sometimes the confusion) between management and union projects.
Work in Groups on the Assembly Line
In 1996, management and works council at Volkswagen Hanover decided to
gradually introduce "groupwork" in all departments. The negotiations' outcome
conducted to implement one of the most innovative forms in the German car
industry2. It meets what
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">Gerst et al. [1995</xref>
            ] call "self organised enhanced
groupwork". Workers are called together in groups composed of ten to fifteen
persons. They are collectively responsible for a portion of the line, are in charge
of distributing the tasks between the different jobs. They are incited to rotate
among jobs on a self-determined rhythm, so that each worker is able to occupy
any job on the group's portion of the line. Each group elects a spokesman who
is not paid for his function. He acts as an internal co-ordinator and represents
the group outside.
          </p>
          <p>Besides production, the group as a whole is responsible for material
provisions, light maintenance, workplace tidiness, repairs on the product, quality
control and tools, but also for planning holidays and overtime recovery. In order
to be able to face those new responsibilities, groups are weekly given an hour
devoted to group-meetings, during working time. Workers themselves settle the
agenda, and may invite any "expert" (planning engineer, foreman, union
representative) being in a position to help them on any question they decide to
address. The most important instruction in a factory is still "never let the line
stop". However, group-meetings cause the stopping of the lines in the middle of
the day. As the works council insisted on the importance of group-meetings,
management finally agreed to implement them, provided that this would not
entail any production losses. As a consequence, daily productivity has been</p>

          <p>
            enhanced, so that the time devoted for group-meetings does not provoke the
fall of the number of produced vehicles. The introduction of group-meeting has
then been followed by an intensification of the work on the line.
"Groupwork" between Innovation and Recurrence
This particular form of work organisation, strongly influenced by union's views,
proposes compatibility between assembly line work and workers' initiative. It
questions the traditional academic conception of assembly line work as an
execution of simple and repetitive tasks demanding no intellectual activity
[Sainseaulieu, 1998:30], as an extremely fragmented work [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Friedmann, 1964</xref>
            ],
or as a manual work bound by rates and technical constraints [Verret, 1999]. By
calling "groupwork" the new organisational pattern and the re-distribution of
responsibilities it is based on, management and union propose a new
understanding of the category of work. According to them, the new organisation
would radically put an end to the former vision of production workers' labour and
initiate an original one, including manual work and administrative
responsibilities, execution and planning.
          </p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-11-1-15">
          <title>The introduction of "groupwork" however maintains a recurrent</title>
          <p>rationalisation policy and cost reduction strategy by intensifying production work
and enhancing rates. The outcome of the negotiations on group-meetings
shows that the production volume is intangible. According to this point,
"groupwork" only represents an adaptation of traditional rationalisation
strategies.</p>
          <p>Consequently, "groupwork" contains a tension between two poles. On the
one hand, the re-distribution of responsibilities breaks with former forms of work
organisation: for the first time, management is giving workers the right to decide
on certain points, and is socialising the decision-making process. On the other
hand, the impossible negotiation on production volume and the continuous rise
in rates reiterate usual forms of rationalisation.
"Groupwork", Group and Work in Workers' View
What do workers think about this new organisation, which is regarded as a
success by the union, supported by management, and considered by the two
parties as an innovation? How do they themselves analyse "groupwork"? In
their opinion, does "groupwork" re-found the category of work? Do they develop
a new vision of factory workers since the introduction of "groupwork"?</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-11-1-16">
          <title>I tried to answer those questions by conducting interviews with production</title>
          <p>workers and asking them what they themselves think about "groupwork"3. By
doing this, I was not seeking to collect information from workers' side that could
validate or not my own hypothesis, but I was willing to get access to workers'
opinion and statements on "groupwork". I considered workers as real interview
partners, as interlocutors.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-11-1-17">
          <title>In the following lines, I will focus on workers' understanding of "groupwork" by identifying the meaning workers give to "groupwork" only from their own statements. This is a specific anthropological enquiry framework, which material only consists of workers' words and assertions.</title>
          <p>I could resume workers' propositions with an apparently absurd sentence:
everything has changed, everything is exactly as it used to be. In each of the 29
interviews I conducted, workers' declarations on "groupwork" are built on
paradoxical affirmations such as "it is better... but it has not changed anything"
or "it is new... but we could already do that before". Workers' quotations are
organised as a network of successive oppositions, separations and
connections. By using simple words, that can be banal or surprising, workers
dismantle and deny "groupwork's" mechanisms and principles. They not only
have their own vision of "groupwork", but also their own idea of work and the
role of factory workers.</p>
          <p>Two cleavages organise workers' point of view. Workers dissociate
"groupwork" from the period prior to the new organisation. They sometimes
underlie a fracture at the beginning of a new period, they also compare the new
organisation with the time before its implementation to soften "groupwork's"
innovative character... and they also point to a fundamental continuity. More
importantly, contrary to the combination that "groupwork" contains, workers do
distinguish group and work and analyse these two words separately. These two
cleavages can cross or part, and require the collection of successive clues from
the anthropologist as well as from the reader.
3</p>
          <p>I spent 7 weeks at Volkswagen in Hanover, in September and October
1998. This time has been devoted to many commented visits of different
departments of the plants, to interviews with middle managers, engineers,
foremen, unions representatives, and with production workers. The
interviews with the workers were strictly confidential. They took place within
the factory, during working time, and lasted an average of two hours. They
were based on a precise questionnaire. These interviews have been
recorded and then transcripted word for word. Céline Bocquillon has helped
with the transcription.</p>
          <p>Work and Group-Meetings: "we do more every day,
nothing has changed"</p>

      </sec>

    <sec id="sec-12">
      <title>We've been working the hours in advance for the group-meetings. The times we need</title>
      <p>for group-meetings, we've been working them in advance.4
This first quotation indicates, on the one hand that the substance of
groupmeetings has got nothing to do with work, and on the other hand, that meetings,
or more precisely, their duration has a particular relationship to work. Meeting
hours result from work, they have been earned by work.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-13">
      <title>We work the entire week to get this group-meeting, because we have a little bit faster tempo because of that [...]. For this group-meeting, the 12 cars that get lost, we build them during the week after, so that it's not given to us in that sense, we're working for it.</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-14">
      <title>For the time we've been loosing today [for the group-meeting], we do a bit more every</title>
      <p>day, nothing has changed, in my opinion, nothing has changed.</p>
      <p>Working for the meeting means producing during the week the vehicles that get
lost because of the meeting, it means working at a higher speed. So that work
relates to a double reference: rates and production. The meeting itself is free
from production and rates, its duration however is subject of a conversion in
production volume. The meeting's "container" do not escape production
constraint. It is absolutely hold in this constraint and transposed into work
through rates increase.</p>
      <p>As a consequence, the implementation of group-meetings – the "content" of
which refers to singular5 principles distinct from the categories that identify work
(see below) – affects the work, in the form of a raise in work's burden through
rates increase (we do a bit more). It does not break with the absolute primacy of
production in the factory: within the factory, each hour is equivalent to a certain
production volume. Time is the expression of production within the factory
(nothing has changed).

      <p>We are working us, because of its unusual form, puts worker in the middle of
the relationship between work and meeting duration. On the one hand, workers
do realise the demanded effort to implement group-meeting without any
production loss. Rates increase signals an intensification of workers' own work.
But on the other hand, workers do benefit from this additional effort and from
the raise in productivity with one hour every week free of both production and
rates for group-meetings. One can read we are working us group-meetings as:
workers are working for workers. Workers then point out the originality of rates
increase following upon the introduction of group-meetings, and specify it.</p>
      <p>Workers do work more, some of them even consider they benefit from this
additional work via group-meetings. In their own words, nothing indicates, this is
modifying their own vision of work. They even declare that nothing has
changed. Nevertheless the expression working for group-meetings suggests an
essential disjunction between work and meeting: meetings are no work. This
represents the first clue, the starting point. I will then first examine what workers
say and think of the group, afterwards I will come back to their own
understanding of work.</p>

concern, he doesn't have this concern anymore, these problems just happened to
become ours, I would say. The foreman may have other concerns, but we have to
settle these problems.</p>
      <p>Just like a double, the group substitutes the foreman since "groupwork" has
been introduced, and one word circulates from one to the other: the word
problem. Independent from what it refers to, if problem is associated to foreman
and is then transmitted, or if problem is associated to group and has to be

      <p>The original expression is: "Wir arbeiten uns das Gruppengespräch"

the production process.</p>
      <p>The group can be identified as a new form of "first-line supervision"7. Workers
now have to face the responsibility to manage daily production on the shopfloor
themselves and to fulfil production goals fixed by the firm. Comparing
responsibilities and goals given to the new first-line supervision with the former
organisation there is no innovation. It only consists in the transfer of the

changes within the ten past years.
to the problems that the group has to settle. Discussion testifies the variety of
possible solutions, the diverse opinions and refers to the determination to
explore them.
      </p>
      <p>In accordance with the transfer of the role and function of the foremen to
the groups, the group is a decision-taking authority. The singular form of the
decision-making, however, differs from the way the foreman used to decide
before: the group is a deliberative authority. Workers actually oppose group to
foreman and show the specificity of the worker-group relationship based on
discussion, contrasting with the worker-foreman relationship based on
commandment. The previous system was a hierarchical one, the foreman was
the only one who could give his opinion, workers were formally in charge of
executing his orders, there was no interlocution. Within the new system,
workers can speak, and talk to each other, they are responsible for determining
the rules about how to manage the production on the shopfloor. Discussion is
the word specifying the originality of the new form of first-line supervision.</p>
      <sec id="sec-21-1">
        <title>To discuss, to find a solution: the meeting represents the support as well as the necessary condition for the new first-line supervision to fulfil its obligations.</title>
        <p>If we have a problem, we can expose it properly during group-meeting, discuss, find a
solution [...], I find it great.
[During group-meetings] we talk about issues, we don't have time to talk about
otherwise. During the breaks, we just switch off during the breaks, we read, or we
bring a book or anything else. We don't feel like talking about work... and we do this
here, during group-meetings we can do that, during the work itself, we don't succeed
[in talking] either, it's loud out there, and we always have something to do, and if 5
persons gather together and talk about anything, a supervisor comes to say: "don't
you have anything else to do!" so that during group-meetings, we have the
opportunity to settle those things, it's important.</p>
        <p>The group-meeting is the only occasion to talk and solve problems that the
group now has to face. The new first-line supervision is the "content" of
groupmeetings. So that we have already solved a part of the enigma, namely specify
the substance of group-meetings: devoted to discussion and decision, the
group-meeting is the place of the new first-line supervision.</p>
        <p>The Group on the Line: "we are forced to support our colleagues"</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-22">
      <title>I find it good, because groupwork, actually it means the works have to be accomplished within the group and not by each individual. Before, it was this idea: "I go to work now, I do my work and it's OK". Think another way means that the works should be accomplished within the group.</title>
      <p>Before, doing the work is referred to I, in a vis-à-vis. About the accomplished
work, an explanation just had to be given to oneself – and formally to the
foreman – but nobody was forced to give any explanation to the other workers.
"Groupwork" has modified the rules, the group is now the frame and the "judge"
of work (the works have to be accomplished within the group), this has to be
taken into account (think another way).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-23">
      <title>Within groupwork, everyone should try, not to work for himself but for the group.</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-24">
      <title>Everyone should be willing to help the others, or in my opinion, help the one that is not really fit anymore, whose productivity is reduced. [...] We can't think each one only for himself, but we have to think for the whole... If one of us doesn't accept it, it's back to the old relationship.</title>
      <p>The group initiates a new relationship among workers on the line. It is no more
an individualistic relationship only referring to oneself (work for himself) but an
open relationship including the other workers and their abilities (help the one
whose productivity is reduced, think for the whole). This new attitude has to be
shared by everybody, its original character specifically happens upon its sharing
out (if one of us doesn't accept it, it's back to the old relationship). It is however
a fragile arrangement dependent on each worker's willingness to submit to
common rules and to take care of the others (everyone should be willing).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-25">
      <title>Well I find it good that we work in the group and that everyone has to participate, and</title>
      <p>that there are not some persons anymore who can stay in the background as they
used to do, because they found an easier job or anything else.</p>
      <p>To have to participate is a new principle "groupwork" has inaugurated. It
demands every worker of the group to contribute and to co-operate on the line.
The group marks the end of reserved job, and leads to a more egalitarian
treatment of workers. Workers consider this as positive.</p>
      <p>Not being able to stay in the background anymore, having to participate,
think for the whole... the group is not only an authority that is deliberating and
deciding rules applicable to everyone, but also a control authority, supervising
the execution of its decisions on the line. Beside discussion, the new first-line
supervision can be distinguished from the old one by two other essential issues.
On the one hand, the application of group decisions on the line does depend in
the end on the commitment of each individual worker. Opposite to the foreman,
the group has no formal sanction power towards its members8. On the other
hand, even if the group actually represents management on the shopfloor, and
even if it has to meet production goals, the group bases its collective rules on a
concern for other workers. Egalitarian treatment concerning job distribution,
mutual aid, support, and the implementation of the new first-line supervision is
built on a certain solidarity compatible with the firm's objectives.
8</p>
      <sec id="sec-25-1">
        <title>However, the group has informal sanction means at its disposal, such as refusing to give holidays at the period asked by the one that doesn't commit to collective rules. Not all groups use those informal sanctions (see note 8). 9</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-25-2">
        <title>Workers declare that the singular relationship based on a mutual aid duty</title>
        <p>begins with "groupwork". As a consequence we should deduce that the group
founds an original solidarity and generates a new idea of workers' collective.
But, a certain amount of other quotations deny the novelty of the new
organisation concerning this point and a few other ones.</p>
        <p>We have always been doing this: "it's exactly as it used to be"</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-26">
      <title>We've always been doing this! Yes, I work on a line where actually nobody never said</title>
      <p>"it's my job, I do my work, and the rest can manage", and I've never had this attitude.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-27">
      <title>When someone just started, and had difficulties on his job, I helped him as much as I</title>
      <p>could, I always cared, does he pull through or not? And on our line, it's always been
like that, if somebody had an emergency, the other helped, it was always like this,
one did this, the other did this also, it was one and the same... actually it didn’t
change so many things.</p>
      <p>The idea this worker has of the relationship among workers on the line has not
changed (this attitude). Mutual aid and support specify this relationship
according to which doing the work is not an individualistic concern one has for
the individual job he has been put on (it's my job, I do my work), but a larger
concern one has for the others and for the work the others have to perform (one
did this, the other did this also).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-28">
      <title>As we work, we also worked like that before, that one supports another. Let's say, there were colleagues that did a work and didn't look to the right or to the left, and there were also other ones that worked in collaboration, you can do your work on your own for yourself, you can work together in collaboration.</title>
      <p>There is a possible multiplicity of the relationship to the others at work. Work
can refer to one's own in an individual relation, or work can refer to together and
collaboration, in a relation that takes the other workers on the line into account.
However, this multiplicity is still valid today, as the use of the present tense
testifies it in the last part of the quotation (you can... you can...). As a
consequence, workers' relationship on the line is not determined by and
subordinated to an organisational framework, it is independent.</p>
      <sec id="sec-28-1">
        <title>Workers' solidarity identified by support, mutual aid and collaboration on the</title>
        <p>line is not induced by the introduction of "groupwork" but pre-exists it. And
despite the group, it is still possible to escape group's pressure9.
9</p>
        <p>Groups can be ruled along very different lines. Some groups have
introduced no collective rules. Some other are governed by rules that
strictly apply to every members. Another kind of group introduced collective
rules but apply them considering each individual situation. For example, if a
worker wants to stay on the same job whereas the others rotate among
jobs, this can be allowed by the group, either temporary or for a long period
of time.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-28-2">
        <title>If we compare the quotations we just examined, with the ones we analysed</title>
        <p>before (third paradox), we find a coherence and a tension. All those quotations
do argue that worker's relationship specified by support and mutual aid
particularly characterises the actual relation among workers within the factory.
But in the quotations claiming that this relationship begins with "groupwork", it is
then presented as a duty and an obligation: "we are forced to support our
colleagues". Whereas in the quotations affirming that this relationship was prior
to the group, it is identified as one possible relationship among others. The
distinction between obligation and possibility identifies the gap separating
"groupwork" with the period before its introduction.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-28-3">
        <title>Before "groupwork", support, mutual aid and collaboration are the words of</title>
        <p>some workers. They only belong to workers, and refer to a certain solidarity
intending to implement local justice on the line. As a consequence "groupwork"
does not inaugurate workers' solidarity but marks its institutionalisation. So that
what was previously independently determined by workers, far from hierarchical
influence, becomes part of the normative framework of the new organisation.
This framework consists in the affirmation and the implementation of new rules
that can not be ignored.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-28-4">
        <title>However, if solidarity is a norm or a possibility, if support and mutual aid are</title>
        <p>related to be forced to or to can, it does not modify what those words mean.
Even if the collaboration on the line is identified as new rule, its effective
implementation still belongs essentially to each worker's attitude. According to
the workers, the group does not inaugurate a new vision of what worker means
for them, it does not initiate a new solidarity within the factory, it does not modify
the vision of workers' collective.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-28-5">
        <title>Group-meetings and the new first-line supervision are the only elements of "groupwork" to still be considered as innovating, at this point. But the following quotations soften the originality of workers' own supervision.</title>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-29">
      <title>In principle it's not bad... but I think we could already do that before groupwork, the work was distributed indeed, but I learnt it like this, as I started here, we could say, you do this work, I do this other one, we could already say that... yes that's it... it's not a big difference, it's just called groupwork.</title>
      <p>The novelty that "groupwork" initiates does not refer to an absolutely new
possibility (we could already) but only to its name (it's just called groupwork).
According to the old organisation, the foreman was formally in charge of
distributing men and tasks among the jobs (the work was distributed), the
implementation of the rule however offered some room for manoeuvre that the
workers invested.</p>
      <p>We were also 8 colleagues on the line, at the beginning we were always doing each
one his job, but one day we said, why not a job further every day, so that we also
worked in circle, today here, tomorrow there, because the works are not the same,
there's always one guy who can this job better, other works maybe worse, that's why
we said the best is every day a job further, and we always worked in circle, you may
have a worse work today, but tomorrow you may have better, so that there is always
this equilibrium (DC: When did you do this?) Since... it was for the T2, around 1981...</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-30">
      <title>We did that at once, ourselves, it came from us.</title>
      <p>Jobs are different, workers' capacities are unequal, above all the satisfaction is
not the same on each job (worse/better work). In order to compensate for these
inequalities, workers decided to implement job rotation, fifteen years before the
official introduction of "groupwork". As a consequence, neither workers'
initiatives, nor job rotation and workers' preoccupation for supervision issues
intending to achieve equity on the line have been initiated by the new
organisation in absolute terms.</p>
      <sec id="sec-30-1">
        <title>The initiative conducing to the implementation of job rotation actually rests</title>
        <p>on the category of equilibrium, and intends to prevent some workers to be
disadvantaged on the long run because of a particularly unpleasant and difficult
job whereas others would be systematically advantaged. This initiative is based
on a conception of work according to which other workers and their own
feelings about their work is essential.</p>
        <p>Regarding supervision, the innovation of "groupwork" rests on its formal
implementation. Despite the clear separation between workers' and foremen's
role imposed by the old organisation, some workers already felt concerned
about the daily management of production, and did not exclusively leave this
task to the foreman. The new organisation relies on those sporadic initiatives,
extend them and give them the statute of a norm. "Groupwork" actually signifies
a rupture by formally constituting the group as a decision-taking authority, and
by granting a weekly meeting to the group, so that it is able to fulfil its
supervision role.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-30-2">
        <title>As they do it concerning solidarity, workers limit the innovation of</title>
        <p>"groupwork" to the rule that management and works council decree. According
to them, "groupwork's" novelty only refers to the new organisational and
normative framework. They deny this framework the ability to have any effect
on their own subjectivity. The following quotation clearly presents this point:</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-31">
      <title>But it was exactly like that before, I mean, but it used to come from us, [...] it didn't change anything, it's the same thing, but now it's just ordered from above and before it came from the colleagues themselves.</title>
      <p>This does not mean however that workers do not take care of these new rules.
They expose those rules' mechanism with a remarkable analytical precision and
a detailed examination that show the attention workers have for these rules.
They assume the new prerogatives: they meet, deliberate and decide. They are
pretty satisfied, one of them even declares "it's great". Very few of them wish to
come back to the old organisation. But neither solidarity and justice on the line,
nor their own vision of worker, or their own idea of work (see below) have been
affected by the new organisation.
"It's called 'groupwork', but in the end we work exactly as we used to
do before"
[Groupwork] is a good thing, a very good thing, yes because people are more
required, but the work, the work on the product is the same, the indirect tasks, this
has become much more interesting what we have to organise ourselves, the indirect
things.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-32">
      <title>Those from the top can say "now it's groupwork" or not, the only thing that comes on</title>
      <p>top of this are group-meetings, but actually... I know what is always told about
groupwork... but in fact it's just this word, in the end the work remains the same, if it’s
written groupwork on it or not, it’s actually... nevertheless it remains because we have
our rates, our time instructions, our work.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-33">
      <title>It's just like before, it's called precisely groupwork but in the end we work as we also used to work before, without 'first worker', but the work progress and all this, it has not changed a lot, it's called groupwork, but if you look carefully, it's the same thing as before.</title>
      <p>These quotations illuminate the fundamental distinction between work and
"groupwork". "Groupwork" is referred to organisational tasks, to
groupmeetings, to a change in the hierarchy on the shopfloor (without 'first worker'),
that is to the new first-line supervision. Workers do not consider "groupwork" as
work, and according to them "groupwork" has no effect on work. Therefore, the
expression "groupwork" is even inadequate and designated as a simple
appellation (it's just this word), or rejected as strange to workers' vocabulary
(those from the top can say "now it's groupwork"). The work is said to be the
same. Product, rates, work progress (decided by planning engineers, work
progress contains the description of the tasks and the time given to accomplish
them) identify, regarding work, what remains unchanged in spite of the new
organisation. Those are issues on which workers still do not have any influence.
We have already seen, from the first paradox, that the new first-line supervision
did not lead to any fundamental modification concerning time as the expression
of production within the factory. We should note that the foreman has never
been responsible for rates and for the speed of the line. As a consequence, it is
not amazing that the new first-line supervision, only based on the transfer of the
role of the foreman to the group, does not lead to change this point.</p>
      <sec id="sec-33-1">
        <title>Even if work appears in a list, near rates, time instructions and work progress, it is not reduced to those terms.</title>

    <sec id="sec-35">
      <title>In my opinion, it's the same work, the same thing. For me it's exactly like before. I also have to do my work, in groupwork or differently.</title>
      <p>To have to do one's work like before splits with the new normative framework
that has been implemented by management and works council, and with the
advent of the group as a decision-taking authority. The foreman can decree
arbitrary instructions, workers can deliberate about the best way to do the work
before taking any decision, this is of no influence regarding the statement I have
to do my work. To have to do one's work like before proposes a subjectivation
of the category of work supplanting concrete changes that occurred within the
factory: rise in rates, job rotation, questioned hierarchy, new organisation but
also the rule (in a group... in an established rule). This distance from the rule is
probably the most significant element. All along their remarks and even in those
ones, workers actually identify "groupwork" as a new set of rules.</p>
      <p>In those quotations, to have to only refers to I, as a self-requisition
concerning work, absolutely heterogeneous and independent from the new
formal rules in force within the factory. To have to do one's work is conjugated
in singular, it does not found any collective or group. It irreducibly identifies a
subjective and essential attitude for workers in the factory. To have to do one's
work specifies an unvarying form of workers' awareness, which principles and
categories are strange to organisational modifications that occurred in the plant.</p>
      <p>The category of work refers to multiple conceptions and leads to very
different statements, depending on which quotation we examine. None of these
statements however is affected by the transfer of the foreman's responsibility
regarding daily management of the production to the group and by the
implementation of a weekly group-meeting. Contrary to what management and
works council argue, "groupwork" does not renew the singular terms of the
category of work thought by the workers.</p>
      <p>Resolution
Workers propose an original idea of "groupwork" that questions the specific title
of this new organisation. Their points of view actually demand an alternative
name that would better account for the field and the limits of the new
organisation. But we will first come back to workers' propositions and
systematically and separately resume what group, on the one hand, and work,
on the other hand, mean for them.</p>
      <p>Concerning the group, workers' words are clear. The group is the new
name of supervision on the shopfloor. It is an executive and decision-taking
authority, but also a deliberative one. Compared to the old supervision,
deliberation is the only novelty. Group-meeting can not be dissociated from the
new first-line supervision, it is its necessary condition as well as an essential
tool for its implementation. Otherwise, it consists only on a transfer of
responsibilities. This transfer has affected neither workers’ solidarity nor the will
to install a certain justice on the line, although the group formally represents
management on the shopfloor. The innovation of this new form of production
management strictly locates in its normative statute decreed by management
and works council. Long before these two parties decide to officially grant the
supervision to workers called together in groups, some workers already cared
for those questions, sometimes in a remarkable way, and went so far as to
negotiate with the foreman the implementation of job rotation.</p>
      <sec id="sec-35-1">
        <title>As for the word work, it relies on multiple conceptions that we should</title>
        <p>consider separately. These conceptions have in common that they are not
affected by the institutionalisation of the group. However they do not add up,
and do not merge. Work is no concept but a 'problematic word': "a word about
which there is a conflict of statements, that is a conflict of thesis and arguments.
Each statement supports a distinct order of the real. The statement can be
materialised or at stake, it is however essentially identified as an intellectuality,
that means as a thesis, a principle" [Lazarus, 1998: 12]. In workers' statements,
four different conceptions have to be distinguished. If they evoke the group, the
mutual aid on the line, and their own preoccupation about production
management, work refers to the concrete job to which each worker is appointed
and to the tasks one has to accomplish on this job (the works are not the same,
do the works in the group, you do this work, I do this other one). Work actually
fits in a concrete and objective vision. On the second hand, if workers declare
that they "work the hours for group-meetings in advance", work is specified by
rates (we have a little bit faster tempo). The time identifies and characterises
the relationship between work and production. In this case, work is referred to
the objective dimension of production, and to the subjective operation according
to which time expresses production within the factory. The statement "the work
is the same" proposes another different conception of work. According to this
conception, work refers to an instruction workers have no influence on, and just
have to implement, that is an external principle (time instructions, work
progress, product). Finally, when they argue "I have to do my work like before",
workers develop a subjective and internal proposition, a self-requisition,
independent from any external reference.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-35-2">
        <title>Beyond the words and specific categories identifying them, work and group can be distinguished, owing to the conclusion that one is a problematic word, and the other refers to an external norm that belongs to an organisational framework.</title>
        <p>
          The analysis of the paradoxical propositions of the workers about
"groupwork" validates the statement "workers think", which argues that thinking
is irreducible to nothing else than itself and can not be determined by
management attitude, concrete changes or norms [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">Lazarus, 1996</xref>
          : 67]. The end
of the investigation actually leads to discover essential and subjective
categories (support, mutual aid, to have to do one's work) that are thought and
developed without referring to the new organisational framework, or to the
concrete and objective changes that came from it. The disjunction between
workers' subjectivity and forms of organisation however does not lead to
condemn "groupwork" as such. But it invalidates the position some sociologists
adopt by proposing a dialectical analysis of these new forms of organisation and
by arguing they affect workers' consciousness, either in a positive way
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Kuhlmann, Schumann, 2000</xref>
          ] or in a negative one [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Moldaschl, 1994</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>Based on the analysis of workers' statements, I propose to adopt the
appellation "team production"10. This term indeed helps us to avoid any
confusion about the renewing of the meaning of workers' collective or not, and
about the eventual changes concerning the category of work, as we showed
that none of them have been questioned by the new organisation. With "team
production", the new organisational framework only refers to the management
of production by teams, on the shopfloor – that is the exact extent to which
workers limit it.
