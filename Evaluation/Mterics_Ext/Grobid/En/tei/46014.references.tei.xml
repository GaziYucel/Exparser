<ref>Performance sorting index is school-level (i.e., between-school) variation in student performance as a percentage of total variation. The OECD regularly reports 
this measure (or its inverse, the so-called "index of vertical inclusion") in its PISA reports. The value reported here is the unweighted average of all available 
measurements from the 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 PISA studies (i.e., across all different domains such as reading or science and different years). Polish 
estimates for 2000 were exluded because of implausibly large differences to subsequent years.</ref>
<ref>7, 8: Values taken from version 4 of the Educational Systems Data Set by Bol and van de Werfhorst (2013). External differentiation index (7) is based on the age of 
first selection, the proportion of the total curriculum that is tracked, and the number of available to 15-year-olds. External differentiation index is missing and 
multiply imputed (10 imputations) for Estonia. Index of vocational orientation (8) is based on the proportion of students in upper secondary education who are 
enrolled in vocational programs, with values taken from OECD, UNESCO, or both if available. See Bol and van de Werfhorst (2013) for further information. 
9: 
Sources for classification: European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (2013), Müller (1994), OECD (2000). 
10: 
Theil index of between-school inequality of instructional resources: School resources are measured using an additive index of 17 items indicating whether 
shortages in various domains limit a school's capacity to provide instrucations (responses of school principals). See Park and Kyei (2011) for further details. The 
measure used and reported here is the unweighted average of all availlable values from the 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007 waves fo the TIMSS (grade 8). The 
measure is missing and multiply imputed (10 imputations) for Poland. 
11-13: Authors' calculations based on PIAAC 2012, 25-to-54-year-olds (including LRNR), survey weights applied. 
12-13: Missing and multiply imputed (10 imputations) for Austria.
